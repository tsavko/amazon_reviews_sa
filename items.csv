"5.0 out of 5 stars,""As has been the case for years, Amazon sloooowwwwly adds new changes and features to the Kindle. This one is no exception. If you've used a Kindle in the past, you're not going to notice much of a change with this one, but since there are some minor upgrades and so forth, I'll briefly go over them:*** SCREEN ***The new Kindle is touchscreen and has the typical matte finish with the slightly gray/off-white paper looking background. It's certainly not bright white, but it's also not LCD looking (dark gray.) It does NOT have buttons for page-turning as the older generations do. If you simply must have the page-turning buttons, please search for the older Kindles that offer that. One last thing regarding the screen: this is not a Kindle PaperWhite or Voyage where you have a back-lit screen... this has an unlit, off-white Kindle screen. I will say, the text is noticeably crisper and bolder than I've seen with previous generation Kindles and I believe that's because Amazon is using E-Ink's new """"Carta"""" displays instead of the previously used """"Pearl"""" displays. I love that and have been waiting for years for E-Ink, the Taiwan based company that makes the Kindle screens for Amazon, to improve them. It looks like they're finally getting it!The new Kindle's screen resolution is 167 ppi which is slightly lower than the Kindle PaperWhite which is 212 ppi, and substantially lower than the Kindle Voyage which boasts an impressive 300 ppi (individual pixels at this density can not be distinguished by the naked eye.) Price-wise though, the base model PaperWhite runs $99 at the time of this review, and the Voyage base model runs $199 so you can see, the more you pay, the better the resolution and features. 167 ppi is fine though... in fact, most webpages are 72 dpi to give you a comparison.*** SPECIAL OFFERS OR NOT ***Like other Kindles, you have the choice of purchasing one with """"special offers"""" which is simply a marketing tactic Amazon uses, which, although some people may find annoying, I actually like as it recommends books that I'm actually interested in versus random crap I'd never buy.*** ON-BOARD STORAGE AND PROCESSOR SPEED ***One upgrade the new Kindle has is the amount of on-board storage which now allows you to hold thousands of books and of course, it also comes with a slightly faster processor which Amazon claims is 20% faster although honestly, I don't notice the increase in speed. Pages turn quickly and that's all that really matters to me speed-wide. The on-board storage is 4GB, although you also have unlimited access to the Amazon Cloud so there really shouldn't be any worries about storage.*** BATTERY LIFE ***Even going back a few years, the Kindle Paper White bragged about a battery that lasted a week versus a day. For very casual reading, that was true with the Paper White although with regular daily use, it was more like 4 days or so, not a week. The new Kindle has a similar claim in that the battery lasts weeks, not days";" that appears to be true. You can easily go two weeks with casual reading and most of that is attributed to the fact that there is no on-board light draining the battery.*** WI-FI CAPABILITY (NOT 3G!)Books are downloaded quickly through WiFi, usually in less than 30 seconds, and definitely under a minute, unless you have really crappy internet service. THIS IS NOT 3G so you CANNOT download books unless you have access to WiFi. I have never found this a problem as I download my books at home in advance of leaving for a trip or something. Besides, nearly every McDonalds, Starbucks, and hundreds of other retailers and restaurants now offer free WiFi so if you simply must download that book while travelling, go park in a McDonalds parking lot and download the book. It's not worth paying the extra money for the 3G access, especially when it oftentimes raises the product price by $50 or more.*** DICTIONARY AND HIGHLIGHTING FEATURES ***Like all new Kindles, the touchscreen has some major advantages, one being that you can click on a word you don't know and pull up the dictionary to learn what it means. Also, you have the option of turning on the """"highlight"""" feature where you can highlight important text AND see what areas of text others have highlighted the most. For someone reading a book for research purposes (writing a paper, review, etc.), this is a nice feature as the parts of the book people find most helpful are usually highlighted, alerting you to its importance.*** AMAZON PRIME BENEFITS ***As is the case with all Kindles, subscribing to the Amazon Prime service is going to give you a lot of bang for your buck as you can """"borrow"""" thousands of books for free, and also get special pricing on some items.*** ACCESS TO YOUR BOOKS ***Books are stored in the cloud and are accessible by any Kindle device registered to you, as well as from your home computer which gives you plenty of options for reading. Some people use a Kindle PaperWhite or Voyage in bed because of the backlight (as I do) and then have another Kindle that they use for daytime reading. Very rarely do I use my home computer to read the books but it is a nice feature to have for some people.*** If this review has helped you in any way, please let me know. You can also post comments or ask questions in the comments section below. I try my hardest to include all the important information about the product to help you make an informed purchasing decision and feel comfortable with your purchase. Thank you for taking the time to read my review! ***"",Detailed Review of the Kindle";;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I've had this Kindle for a while now. Many of the reviews say it all so I don't think I could add much. But I feel like I need to speak on behalf of this Kindle to shield it from reviewers and owners who seem to have no idea what they bought. If this could help clear up any confusion for a first time buyer then writing this is worth it. So I have to begin by asking reviewers that confuse us all?Do you have any clue what you bought? Let's all say it out loud: THIS KINDLE DOES NOT HAVE A LIGHT!!!!!! It is an entry level model with no light. Amazon has always sold non lighted Kindles, and I still have many of them. They are a cheap way to get into the e-reader scene. Can you read a real book in the dark? Of course not. So these non lighted Kindles are not epic failures for not having a light just as the last novel you bought was not an epic failure for not having a built in light. It is ridiculous to buy this Kindle then give it a 1 star review because it doesn't have a light. Read the product descriptions. This Kindle has no light, the Paperwhite and Voyage do.Scream all to the heavens: THIS KINDLE DOES NOT HAVE PAGE TURNING BUTTONS!!!! To buy this Kindle then give it a 1 star review because your old Kindle had page turning buttons and this one does not is insane. Could you not see when you clicked on """"BUY"""" that this Kindle had no page turning buttons. Sometimes I think there are two kinds of Kindle owners: those who want page turning buttons and those who don't mind moving their thumb a nano meter to turn a page. If you can tell by my sarcasm, I belong to the latter bunch.Then of course there are the technically deficient that have no clue what wifi is, are unable to sign on, and blame it on the Kindle. BAM! another 1 star review. Well I feel for you on this one, If you are new to the scene all Kindles come wifi ready, ready to sign on to your wifi set up at home. When this is done you can buy book from your Kindle or computer. All of your purchases are held in that magical storage space called """"the cloud"""" and you can access those from any Kindle registered under your name.Now for my two cents. This is a great Kindle. The software is the latest, similar to the Paperwhite. It's quick, has any feature you could ask for from an entry level Kindle. I don't understand the hate for touch screen. You should embrace it. See that word on the page you don't know? Touch it with your finger and a dictionary pops up giving you the definition. How many clicks on the Kindle Keyboard would this same function take (still have my Keyboard and love it, but probably like one loves an antique typewriter). As far as page turns go, see my nano meter thumb comment above. Once you get used to it it's a piece of cake. Hey, the first time I picked up an iPhone to type a text message """"how are you?"""" it came out """"lskdlj eiieoi c";"?"""" You need to acclimate yourself to a touch screen. Once you do those page turning buttons will start to feel like cheap little bits of plastic that will eventually stop working.Under a lamp or in natural daylight the text is bold and easy to see. Some fonts are bolder than others. This is also a very light Kindle. I've found kind of a sweet spot for holding Kindles. Pinching the bezel to hold it is awkward. I place the bottom left corner in the middle of my palm, rest the back of it on my four fingers, and tilt it slightly to the left so it doesn't fall in my lap. My thumb is perfectly free to move that nano meter to turn a page.So let's sum up:*This Kindle does not have a light.*This Kindle does not have page turning buttons.*This Kindle (like all Kindles) has wifi capability. When you are home on your wifi you can buy and download books from the Kindle store. If you go to the beach, you cannot. If you want this then get 3G. This is like a cell phone. Personally I've never needed to buy a book outside of my home so never felt the need for 3G.If this helps one person it was worth typing."",Know what you are buying!!!!";;;;;
"4.0 out of 5 stars,""I am writing this from the perspective of being a long-time experienced Kindle user vs. someone brand new. From an overall perspective, considering the pricing of the Kindle with Special Offers at $79 vs. higher amounts for the different flavors of Kindle available today, this one is a bargain. If you have wanted to get your kids a Kindle to encourage reading as well as sharing of books but hesitated because $119 to $400+ is a lot of money to risk with a child, maybe at $79 this is your price point.From a size standpoint, the reading screen is the exact same size as the other e-Ink Kindles.  It is slightly thicker - but slightly lighter - than the Kindle Paperwhite, but to me it's not really a noticeable difference when you're holding it in a protective cover.Opening up the box, included with the Kindle is a micro-USB cord but no power adapter.  That's really annoying. Interestingly, and it seems rather chicken of Amazon, a power adaptor has to be purchased separately for $15 if you purchase it at the same time as you purchase the Kindle (or $20 if you purchase it later), so if you already have a micro-USB charger handy I wouldn't order one of the chargers.There are no page buttons - no buttons at all except for the power button - and turning the page is as easy as tapping the side of the screen with your thumb while you're reading, or swiping the screen with your finger.Reading is easy on this one: in comparison to my Kindle Keyboard, the previous version of Kindle, and a Kindle DX the letters on the screen are much, much darker and easier to read: the display is crisp and dark. Looking at the display side-by-side in the same location of an eBook against the versions of Kindle mentioned above, the text on this Kindle is much darker and reads a lot better. Compared to a Paperwhite it is not as dark but those results are to be expected since the Paperwhite has 25%+ more pixels per inch, but at this price point that's not too big of a concern for me as each new version of the Kindle gets better and better with the fonts and screen display and this one is pretty darn good - you want to be able to read what you're supposed to, right?If you like the text-to-speech feature of previous Kindle models or listened to music with your previous Kindle, please be aware there are no speakers nor is there a plug for headphones.Web surfing speed with the wireless is about the same as with other versions of the e-Ink Kindles: slow as Christmas!  My usual test of the connectivity on a Kindle was hitting the main pages of the mobile websites of Fox News, CNN, and Google. I pushed """"go"""" or """"enter"""" buttons / icons at the same time on each and did not see a visible difference in the load speeds start to finish: I was about 50 yards away from my wireless router at home with a couple of walls in the way for the wireless test, with similar results at my office after the Kindle arrived. I did try to check one of my Google email accounts but it crashed.  I learned a couple of years ago to not try and surf the Internet with an e-Ink Kindle because it's so darn slow";" besides, I use the Kindle to read a book and I can surf the Internet or check my email on my other devicesIn comparison the previous version of Kindle this one is replacing, other than the crisper text / fonts from the improved screen display, as far as I can tell this new version of Kindle has the same technical specifications of the previous Kindle: about the same size, same internal memory. If you had a precious version of the Kindle this version is replacing, that means you can use the same cover as the previous version.Battery life is supposed to last """"...weeks on a single charge"""" but I doubt it: I charged it up 100% late yesterday afternoon and, 24 hours later, the battery meter is indicating about 50% left. This was with the Wi-Fi left on but the Kindle not being used overnight as I left it in the office in sleep mode.  Time will tell if this is going to be a problem or not.It did take a few minutes to get this model up and running as, in addition to the normal making sure it is registered and going through a mandatory tutorial on which areas of the screen to tap to perform various functions, there is a lot of Amazon marketing you have to weed through: do you want to sign up for Goodreads (an Amazon affiliate), would you like to sign up for Kindle Unlimited (for a monthly recurring revenue stream to Amazon), would you like to link your Facebook and Twitter accounts so your're friends / family / perfect strangers can be voyeuristic on what you are reading (absolutely not for me).You can also sign up for parental controls with this version which I think is a great idea - sometimes you don't want your children to read what you are reading.One annoying thing (to me, at least) is the automatic import of the various categories / collections you have linked to your Amazon account onto this version and links to the books in the Cloud that you can immediately download in the same category on the new Kindle.  If you're replacing an older Kindle with this one that could be handy, but if you have other people on your account / family in households with more than one Kindle, that can be a pain in the neck because, for example, my wife and I generally have different tastes in books - I don't want her books cluttering up my Kindle's screen and she feels the same way about mine.  IT's not a deal killer, but it does make you wade through a lot of stuff.Despite some of my nits above, as a parent whose children can be hard on electronics I likethis version, and think with this $79 price point it will help to continue to explode the eBook revolution even faster as they get in more people's hands. If you have not purchased a Kindle before due to price, need a cheaper replacement than the other versions, or maybe a relative or a friend has hesitated to get one this one is in your price zone, I would recommend this one!"",Good Value at $79 with a Few Nits";;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I got this Kindle during a Black Friday sale at Best Buy last year. They had this Kindle and one of the Kindle Fires discounted and I was torn between which one to buy. I finally went with this one because I don't really need another device on which, essentially, to watch Netflix! While I am an avid reader, this was my first e-reader purchase. I'd read entire books on my laptop and smart phone before so I'm not one of those """"I'll only ever read a real book because that's how it's meant to be"""" people. I think e-readers are great. I'd just never made it a point to buy one with all the unread books I already have lying around the house. That being said, I love my Kindle now. Since November I've probably read close to twenty books. It's just so easy. Using this particular Kindle also has the added benefit that it's just an e-reader. Not a tablet, i.e. a trove of distractions. I am delighted by the fact that I can just take trip with my little device and have more books than I need. It really makes me feel like I am living in the future. I find it amazing every time that it's a Saturday night and I find out about something I need to read immediately, I can just get on the Kindle store and buy a new book without ever having to leave my house. I also love the size. It fits in any of my handbags or coat pockets. I think it's intuitive and easy to use. I love that it's glare-free because I tend to spend a lot of time outside and I can see the text no matter how bright the sun is shining. The battery life is great. Since owning it, I've probably charged it three times. I would highly recommend the cover Amazon has for this model. It's really handy. I'm attaching a picture to show what a lovely addition Kindle with the cover makes to an already wonderful day. I'm definitely glad I bought this over a tablet. It's perfect for me."",A book lover's delight!";;;;;;
4.0 out of 5 stars,Pros: Anti-glare Book-like screen(should have been a bit brighter though).Eye-friendly.Quick reach to dictionaries and translations.Word-wise is a good feature.Easy reach to Wiki.Havent used X-Ray so cant comment on that.Light weight. Easy to use. Handy.Cons: Almost none if you look at it as an e-reader.A small brightness setting would have helped :D,Overall good replacement(an upgrade I would say) for a physical book!;;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I finally got a Kindle because I had to take a 3-week trip to Rotterdam from California. I knew I would never be able to carry as many books as I would need, especially since we were going to need to carry a number of things back with us. It was a long flight with layovers both ways, and sleeping was nearly impossible in the cramped plane.I loaded the Kindle with e-books (I had a collection by one of my favorite authors, and there are lots of free books to download, and I decided to try Kindle Ultimate while I was at it) and packed it into my computer bag. It saved my life during the flight and the trip both. My husband thinks I should have gotten the one with its own lighting, but now that I'm home again, access to a reading light is not an issue.The text is amazingly clear--really, my graphics geek husband marveled over it--and being able to adjust the size means that even if I've forgotten my reading glasses, I can still read. (They don't always make it from one room to the other.) The faint gray tone to the background seems odd for a moment, but then completely natural.Battery life has generally been very good. It helps to actually turn the screen off when not reading. I don't mind seeing the ads, but they do use up power. I left the Wi-Fi turned off the entire time I was in Rotterdam, and I think that helps save power, too.I got the power adapter, but since that only works in the US, I just charged the Kindle by connecting it to my computer. Now that I'm home, I have the power connector next to my bed, so I can charge while reading.I expect to be buying e-books rather than paperbacks from now on, which is just as well, as even my abundant shelving is starting to overflow. I only wish I could """"rip"""" my existing book collection to Kindle format."",The Survival Guide to Overseas Flights: Buy a Kindle";;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""There are nearly 2000 reviews already written on this device... we wouldn't have bothered to add our comments except that some of the reviews that come up first because they are suppose to be the most helpful... have what seems to be inaccurate information.  We have had a """"KIndle Keyboard"""" for years now and we subscribe to both Prime and Kindle Unlimited. We still love the """"Keyboard"""" which for those who are unfamiliar is actually a """"third generation"""" Kindle which was originally released at the end of July in 2010.  Even after four years the """"Keyboard"""" is still quite useful and the battery is still strong. In addition to being a normal e-reader it also has audio output.  It can read books to you and play MP3 files.  It is a quality device and if taken care of... it will last a long time.  Our experience with it is the primary reason we trust products with the Amazon name to be quality items.We actually love our newest little Kindle which is actually a """"seventh generation"""".  We weren't planning on buying one because our """"Keyboard"""" is still going strong, but there was a promotion where it was $20 off and it came with a 6 month extension to our """"KIndle Unlimited"""" subscription which was $30 off.  So our plan was to not open it and then sell it on eBay and keep the 6 month extension to our """"Kindle Unlimited"""" subscription.  But curiosity got the best of us.  So a few hours after it arrived we opened the box and took it for a spin and a side-by-side comparison with our beloved """"Keyboard"""".So first... what did we find inaccurate in the other reviews... The screen, it does give a very good first impression.  Amazon and nearly every reviewer claim that it is whiter, brighter and has better contrast than previous generations of Kindles.  We have always been happy with the screen on our """"Kindle Keyboard"""" and were not sure why it needed any """"improvements"""".  When we put our Kindle Keyboard next to the new Kindle under the same light to us the screens look nearly identical.  The only real difference we noticed is that the font on the new one seems more refined and is better to look at.  Not only that... there are several fonts to choose from.  Side by side there is no question that a book on the screen of this latest generation Kindle looks better than a book on the """"Keyboard"""" because of the new fonts, but to us the screen itself doesn't appear any lighter, whiter, brighter or have higher contrast. We have tablets with high resolution screens with incredible color, contrast and brightness, but we have always appreciated our older kindle because it's screen is as close to a paper book that we have found. So we are more than a little relieved that the """"improvements"""" to the screen are pretty much all hype.  The screen does refresh quicker than our 4 year old """"Keyboard"""" to the point where it is hardly noticeable when changing pages but to us it is the new fonts that make the experience better.The next thing we noticed is that even though we are used to clicking buttons to navigate on the """"Keyboard"""" the touchscreen really is much faster and less frustrating.  I can't tell you how many times we have been clicking the down arrow repeatedly to get to a menu item on the """"Kindle Keyboard"""" and then accidentally have touched the back button which is right below it and literally had to start all over.  Even after all of these years... it still happens fairly frequently.Then there is the """"home button"""" and page turning buttons that some people seem to think that they cannot live without.  We don't get it.  On the """"Keyboard"""" we do like the dedicated buttons, without them navigating would be a bear, but with the touch screen... they really are not necessary.  For example... to get to your """"home screen"""" you tap at the top of the touch screen, then you touch the """"home icon"""" in the top left corner and you are there.  To change pages you can either swipe forward or back or just touch the edge of the screen.  Personally, we prefer to use one of those little rubber tipped tablet pointers so we won't get finger prints on the screen but as long as you haven't been eating some kind of greasy food it is not much of an issue.We also like the newer software combined with the touch screen and faster processor.  Everything feels smoother and more intuitive as compared to the """"Keyboard"""". We have to admit that we use our expensive tablets a lot with the Kindle reading App especially with books that have color pictures.  So we are used to navigating with touch screen devices with powerful processors, but there is something about the Kindle e-reader experience that we still appreciate with our older Kindle.  With this newer Kindle you still get the dedicated e-reader experience without having to give up the more intuitive nature of a touch screen.The only other thing that we wanted to mention was the """"Special Offers"""".  Our older Kindle did not have that and we like all the interesting literary screen savers that come up on it and will miss them on the new one.  But the """"Special Offers"""" occasionally have some interesting ads.  Yesterday, an ad for some reading glasses with three levels of magnification came up and we found them quite interesting and reasonably priced. We will miss the old screen savers, but the """"Special Offers"""" don't really seem to be a problem at all.  If they become irritating to us it costs only $20 to """"unsubscribe"""".My wife and I both have expensive tablets with beautiful screens and fast processors.  They are incredibly useful to us and have dozens of apps that do just about everything from video conferencing to playing games.  These tablets also have a lot of personal account information and other valuable data stored on them.  They are also quite attract to thieves.  If we lost one of them it would be much more than a minor inconvenience.  It is nice that as of now this latest little Kindle contains nothing that isn't saved to the cloud, it has little if any personal information.  If it were lost all we would have to do would be to log onto Amazon and deregister it from our list of devices.  We would probably also change my Amazon password just to be safe, but my point is... it is nice to have a small dedicated electronic device that is incredibly useful, but wouldn't be devastating if something happened to it.We like the way that the Amazon e-readers have continued to evolve.  This """"seventh generation"""" Kindle is lighter, faster, has a touch screen, better looking fonts and has refined software.  It is a pleasure to use.  We weren't planning on getting another tablet like device, but this little guy is a winner.  We are keeping it."",""Kindle, 6"""" Glare-Free Touchscreen vs Kindle Keyboard... clearing up some innacuracies.""";;;;;;
"4.0 out of 5 stars,""I love having moved from the buttons to this value priced touch screen with two exceptions. First, I didn't realize how much I was depending on the texture on the back of my old Kindle to keep from dropping it. The cheaper plastic on this new model is super slick and dropable. I added some textured stickers on day two of ownership.But much more important, brush the screen with the edge of your sleeve or, heaven forbid place it face down in your lap for a sec and your font size will be changed. At first I thought, """"no big deal"""" but I have been using my new Kindle for two days and I have probably fix the font 100 times. That's getting old fast, and apparently touch Kindle users have been asking for a font lock for at least two years."",Great but PLEASE give us a font lock";;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I've used tablets for years to read my Kindle books using the Kindle App for Android. But recently, I bought a Kindle Paperwhite for my sight-impaired dad and I liked his so much that I bought a Kindle for myself. I'm finding the advantages to reading on a dedicated eReader over an all-purpose tablet well worth it. For one, I've been having a lot of issues lately with eye fatigue from working on the computer all day and reading on my Kindle is far easier on my eyes. Reading on a Kindle is very similar to reading the paper pages of a physical book. I can see it definitely reducing my eyestrain.The other thing I like is that the battery on my Kindle stays charged so much longer. I had to plug my tablet in every few hours to recharge the battery. It's so much better to read my books anytime I want without having to worry about a low battery, especially when I'm out and about, in the waiting room at the doctor's office, etc. At home, I keep my Wifi turned on at all times and the battery still loses only about a fourth of its charge during the day with me reading maybe a couple of hours a day. I turn the Wifi completely off on my dad's and he reads mostly all day long and his battery still stays charged three-quarters of the way. Both Kindles even came with about a half-a-battery's worth of charge already on them, so you can set-up your Kindle before doing an initial charging, which ended up taking only a couple of hours, instead of the four that it recommends for a completely discharged battery.Initial set-up of your Kindle is super easy! If you're an existing Kindle user, Amazon already has you connected to your Amazon account when you receive your Kindle. Even connecting to my home Wi-fi was easy. Just remember that if you've got a secured home network, you need to enter your encryption key code NOT the regular network password. It's a one-time entry. You can then connect and disconnect to your Wi-fi at any time and it will remember your network, unless you delete it from your Kindle's Wi-fi settings. Your user manual is right on your Kindle and it contains everything you'll need to know about using your Kindle. Also, if you don't have a PC to plug your Kindle into to charge it up, you will need to buy a USB wall charger, because all that comes in the box is the Kindle and a USB cable. I also ordered the Omoton Kindle Smart Case cover, sold here on Amazon by DealBarn, for both my dad's Kindle and mine. They are well-made, lightweight and fit the Kindle perfectly. Closing the case cover automatically puts your Kindle to sleep, opening wakes it up, so no having to push the on/off button. Easy-peazy! But be sure to order the Omoton for the 7th Generation Kindle, not for the Paperwhite, because the 7th Gen Kindle is just a fraction of an inch wider (4.7-in as opposed to 4.6-in for the Paperwhite).I ordered the Glare-Free Kindle (the one without the backlight) with the special-offer ads to save an extra $20 on the purchase price, but I don't mind the advertisements at all. You get a different ad on your splash-screen every time the Kindle goes to sleep. They're almost always Kindle-related and actually a few of them I've clicked on because they were good deals on Kindle books or accessories. And if I want to read at night in the dark, I can always read on my tablet, because you can keep your books synced on all your reading devices with Amazon's cloud. The only negative about the Kindle, and it's not really a negative to me and might not be to you, is that with the Glare-Free, Paperwhite and I think also the Voyage Kindles, the book pages are black-and-white only - no color - similar to reading a paperback book. However, like I said before, when I do want to read in the dark or see the illustrations in color, I can just read my books on my tablet. So I actually have the best of both worlds! I love my Kindle!"",An All-Purpose Tablet User Converts to Kindle - Easier on Eyes with Superior Battery Life! I Love My Kindle!";;;;;;

"1.0 out of 5 stars,""This is my third Kindle and the first that I dislike. I want a simple reader to read books and nothing more, that is why I get the basic one. This version has added features that have nothing to do with reading and in return adds another layer of bells and whistles that takes away from that basic function, reading.  The interface is not as intuitive as previous versions  When I go to pick it up I have to get past my annoyance with it and when I do begin to become lost in the book I am brought back to that annoyance by brushing the screen and having all kinds of ### pop up that I have no desire to use.  I don't need to resize the print so often that it needs to be a one touch operation , I don't want to share what I am reading with anyone, I was always impressed with the dictionary feature but now I often get no definition and instead get an attempt to connect to Wikipedia .I understand there are those who like all the shiny bells and whistles  and it is great that they offer advanced models for them, but as a basic reader this version is a step back in what should be it's basic function, reading.It has me considering the fact that if I forced to take what ever trinkets they come up with to read the books I """"own"""" then do I really own them?"",... is my third Kindle and the first that I dislike.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I wish I had bought a Kindle sooner. Let me preface this by mentioning that when a family member got a 4th Generation Kindle about 2 years ago, I could not figure out how to use it. The small buttons and no keyboard drove me crazy trying to type in what I wanted, trying to navigate on the Kindle screen to purchase or find books, and downloading books. I found the page turn buttons to be annoying and it was too easy to accidentally press them while reading. I couldn't figure out where to put my hand to hold the Kindle while avoiding the page turn buttons.The Kindle touch has changed all of that. It's easy to navigate and easy to type because it's all touch responsive. You don't have to worry about turning the page unless you touch your finger to the screen, and because of this, turning the page is really easy. Built into the Kindle interface, I can hold my finger on a word I don't know and it will give me a definition of that word in my choice of 2 dictionaries. The lack of buttons on the bottom gives you ample space to place your thumb to grasp the Kindle, and the same for the edges on the left and right of the screen, to rest your finger of the same hand for stabilization. To make things even easier, I purchased Popsockets to put on the back so I can hold it with a flat hand.My only caveat is that there is no light, which I knew before purchasing, but the screen is somewhat darker than expected. It's not as bright as a piece of paper in front of you, it's a shade or two dimmer. In daylight or indoors, this is not a problem, but if you read in bed at night with a low watt lamp next to you, you're going to want the screen to be brighter. If I could turn the light off completely on the Voyager, I would have opted for that one in retrospect.Things I like: Touch screen No buttons Easy to navigate and type because of the touch screen Space to grasp due to no buttons Small power button on the bottomThings I don't like: The screen is dimmer than expected and has no light to compensate. Only comes with a USB cord to charge off of your computer, no wall plug. I use the base from the iphone charger with the Kindle USB. The lack of a charging base is clearly a way for Amazon to earn extra money when you purchase the wall plug, but if you want to look at it from a positive perspective, for the many who refuse to pay extra money for the wall plug, providing only the USB cord is ecofriendly and minimizing technological waste being sent to Guiyu, China, the e-waste recycling hub of the world, to be recycled when we no longer want our used electronics. (Children and adults alike in the city of Guiyu are getting sick from lead poisoning and various other ailments from the toxicity of the air, water, and direct exposure to heavy metals from inside our electronics). The ads and having to pay $20 to remove them is cheap marketing, where Amazon is profiting off of you seeing the ads, and profiting off of you not wanting to see them. Clever, but not classy.Unknowns:How easily does the screen dent? Does it need a screen protector or a hard case to protect the screen?Update 7 months later: I still LOVE my kindle. I had no idea I would ever love it this much. I don't go anywhere without it."",""I love it and you will too, if you don't mind that the screen is surprisingly dimmer than expected.""";;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I'm loving my new kindle. I previously had the kindle keyboard and sold it because I have an iPad and thought I didn't need it. I caught this handy ereader on sale at Staples for $49. I couldn't resist. I'm a gadget lover. It's very small and light weight. It's more fun to read on my ereader than my iPad Air. I love this little thing. I like the touchscreen and all the features that come with it. If you are looking for something small and lightweight to read on, this is the perfect device. I know the kindle paperweight and the kindle voyage have better resolutions but for what I'm using it for, I don't need to spend all that money for an ereader. It's perfect. I don't have any complaints. It's easy to highlight passages and make notes with the touchscreen. I also like that I can send my PDFs to my kindle. Get one. You won't regret it."",LOVE my new kindle";;;;;;
2.0 out of 5 stars,Not happy. The old 5-button Kidle was better. The screen is too sensitive at times and not sensitive enough at other times. When you shut off and return the book you're reading isn't moved to the top of the list. You have t remember the title to reopen the book.I had to try five times to remove a book from the device. In general I don't like the new Kindle.,not happy;;;;;;
"4.0 out of 5 stars,""Ive been the proud owner of the original kindle fire for about three years. As a tablet, its great. But I really love to READ and my issue with the Fire was bugged out eyes even using minimal lighting. So for some time I pored over the kindle ereader reviews and when Amazon sent me a special offer on the new $79 kindle I took the plunge.BOTTOM LINE: I love it!I love the screen which doesn't even look like a screen but  more like  newspaper (I actually gave it a little tap when I took it out of its box to see if it was a screen or a sticker). Also, I read a lot of old books which are sometimes full of now forgotten English words and French phrases, and with the """"vocabulary builder ' feature I can look up, translate from several languages into English, highlight, store new words in flashcards etc. I can also send a quote to my Goodreads feed which is pretty neat. And I can read for hours and my eyes are happy. No there's no lighted screen but that appealed to me as I don't often read in the dark anyway. For me, no backlight means no buggy eyes.I have used the """"experimental browser """" and its not too shabby. I was able to download MOBI files from other sources and they open just fine on the home screen. I can also organize my books, magazines and documents into collections which was never an option on the kindle tablets, so I'm thrilled about that.And it's light! Half the weight of my Kindle Fire so no more """"Kindle elbow """".I know the battery wont last weeks for me because I read more than 30 minutes a day but even if it lasts for a few days (rather than a few hours) it will be awesome.Why 4 Stars? Well, I'm not crazy about the """"page blinking """" when you scroll down a list of books. I don't know why that couldn't have been cleaned up since the tablets don't do that. Its my first ereader so maybe this is common, I don't know, but its annoying.But I love this, its very reasonably priced and I keep finding new features to love."",Love this ereader";;;;;;

They are the best and helped me so much over last 5 years.,Love love love my new kindle;;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""After enjoying my Kindle 5th generation for a few years, I decided to upgrade to the new 7th generation basic Kindle. I needed a device with more memory and at only $79 with Special Offers and $99 without, it seemed to be a decent reader at an affordable price.I went on quest to search for one locally. Staples was a no-go. They only had the previous gen models and a well-worn display.  Fortunately, Best Buy was right next door. Best Buy also had a beat-up display, but alas there was a lonely 7th gen basic with no tagging or price. If I hadn't recognized it from pictures I had seen, I would have probably missed it.Note to Amazon: You really need to improve your merchandising. Best Buy now has a Apple store, Samsung store, Windows store and Sony store.  How about a Kindle store?Anyway, I finally got it home and opened up the typically minimalist Kindle box. Inside, there was only the Kindle, a basic instruction card and a USB cable.  No power adapter. That will cost you an extra $15-20 for the Amazon version.Fortunately, I still have the charger from my old 3rd gen Kindle """"keyboard"""" model.  Reportedly, you can also charge the device in about 4 hours from your computer's USB jack.Compared to my 5th gen, the new basic Kindle seems to be less sleek and more boxy.  The beveled back breaks up the otherwise bland and utilitarian design and makes the device easy to hold.  It is slightly thicker than the old version and a tad wider and longer as well. It offers a wider bezel and a bigger """"chin"""". The design is reminiscent of the first generation Kindle Fire which leads me to believe that Quanta may be behind this build. There are no buttons other than the power button at its usual location next to the USB port at the bottom.That's right. No buttons. This is the first basic Kindle to offer touch control. It uses an infrared (rather than capacitive) 6"""" touch screen featuring Pearl e-paper technology with 167 ppi resolution. It is capable of 16 levels of gray and is not back-lit. The contrast seems to be similar to that of my 5th gen and text is dark and easy to read.  Photos can look a bit washed out, however.New features include:Goodreads and social media integration.Enhanced """"X-Ray"""" feature that allows you to see the structure of fictional works.Integrated vocabulary builder with flash cards.Kindle """"FreeTime"""" to encourage young people to increase their reading.Features coming soon include:""""Family Library"""" to allow you to link to your spouse's account.""""Word Wise"""" to allow you to read selected challenging books more easily.Enhanced search capabilities incorporating info from Goodreads and the Amazon site.""""About the Book"""" for more detailed author and book info.The new 7th generation Kindle basic comes with 4GB of memory--twice as much as my 5th gen--and enough to store thousands of average-sized books.  In addition, as with all other Kindle devices and software, you also receive free cloud storage for your books and documents.Using the new 7th gen is pretty easy.  The only snag is that, when you hit the power button, nothing seems to happen.  However, if you look closely, you will see a message at the bottom of the screen to swipe to unlock your Kindle.Also, the infrared touch screen works much better than I expected. It is very responsive and flawless in operation.  You just tap on the right to advance a page, on the left to go back a page, and on the top of the screen to view the menu and other information.  I found it almost as enjoyable to use as a capacitive screen, despite its lack of multi-touch capabilities.In addition, the device allows you to view the covers of the books or just the text of the titles.  As with previous Kindles, there is an experimental web browser that is poky and awkward to use, but it may come in handy in a pinch. I guess that is why it is still experimental.All in all, the 7th gen basic Kindle is a solid performer with long battery life (weeks, not days, in many cases), great readability and ease of use, small footprint and light weight.  If you are looking for a non-backlit e-reader that can hold a library full of books, it is a great choice.Complete review at: http://tonythomastechtrends.blogspot.com/2014/10/kindle-7th-generation-basic-review-2014.html"",Great Device for the Price!";;;;;;

"2.0 out of 5 stars,""I was very happy with my old Kindle, with the little buttons at the bottom, and the page turn buttons on the side. When I finally broke the last one and all my warranty replacements were out (get the warranty, by the way - outstanding deal, good service), I looked all over for a replacement, but there were none to be had. Apparently, this is the new generation of my Kindle, and I have to take what they're offering.The appearance of the visual interface is different, and in my opinion less attractive than the old.The new """"time left in chapter"""" feature apparently thinks it takes me one minute to read a chapter, no matter how long that chapter is.The distance between the power switch and the charger socket is increased which means I have to take the Kindle out of its cover to charge it.But the worst is the touch screen. I didn't want a touch screen, but apparently I no longer have the option. My hands tend to tremble, which makes aiming at the small screen an adventure. The sensitivity is such that sometimes the slightest breeze will cause the pages to turn and sometimes all the tapping in the world doesn't seem to work. If I hold the Kindle anywhere but the bottom, I end up turning pages, sometimes repeatedly, so I wind up spending more time trying to get back to the place I was at than I do actually reading.I was happy with the Kindle I had, but now I get to pay more for what I consider an inferior product that doesn't suit my needs anywhere near as well as the product it is intended to replace.#ProgressOne potential positive: The battery seems to last longer, though it has only been a few days, so I could be wrong about that.BRING BACK THE BUTTONS!!![Update] it's been about a month now, and I hate the touch screen more than ever. It keeps changing text size on me and every time I jostle it it turns the pages.The touch screen seems very inconsistent with what portion of the screen does what when touched. I can touch the same place 6 times in a row and end up anywhere within a twelve page span. It goes back and forth seemingly at random.Highlighting and definitions are sometimes quicker, but more often, I spend more time trying to highlight just what I want to highlight than I did just pushing the buttons.The edition of the Bible I have had easily navigated chapter links, so I could navigate quickly and easily with between the books and chapters during study classes. Now I can't even FIND the darn chapter links, much less use them.And the active content, the word games that I used to love to play...GONE. I can't play my word games on this version of the Kindle.I've seen the comments here, Amazon: You had a real winner with the last generation. Why not either bring it back or make it available new to those of us who prefer to buy it new? The ball is in your court."",""Higher Price for an Inferior Product - Bring Back the Prior Generation, Please (Updated)""";;;;;;
"2.0 out of 5 stars,""I owned a Kindle Touch a couple of years ago and lost it and was hoping this newer one would be a good replacement.  I'm not so sure at this point because there are some key differences between the so called """"newer"""" 7th generation and the one I had, which I think was 5th generation.(1) The device never turns off.  The only choices are sleep mode and turning the screen off, but any slight movement even after you have closed the top of the cover, turns the screen back on again.  I think this is a waste of battery life.  My former Kindle could be turned off when I was not using it and wanted to put it away.(2) The stability of the Wi-Fi connection.  Navigating through the kindle store on the device is terrible and I am at home using the same home network that I used on my old Kindle and on several other devices (2 tablets and 2 laptops).  The device moves quickly to the home page of the store, but once you have picked a category, and try to drill down into subcategories, it seems to freeze and not go any further. It's faster to go on my laptop, log into Amazon and find an item to buy rather than make the purchase on the device.  That was never a problem on my old Kindle.Basically, newer apparently is not always better. In my opinion, the 7th generation is not an improvement I've only had the Kindle for a couple of weeks, and I don't know whether to keep it or not.  I guess I'm just longing for my old Kindle which gave me no problems."",The older version was comparatively better";;;;;;
"4.0 out of 5 stars,""E-book readers occupy a very unique corner of the technology industry. While every other form of technology benefits from better performance and higher specs, this rule does not apply nearly as much to e-book readers. Just give me something that shows me words in black and white. This is why the base model kindle shines and is, in my opinion, the best kindle currently available.I am coming from the first generation paperwhite. I actually had a very negative experience with it. The first problem I had was with the build quality. The bezels on the paperwhite were very poorly glued on, sitting slightly askew. The uneven lighting didn’t help either. I’m pretty OCD about things being perfect, and these aspects really bothered me. Furthermore, the rubberized coating felt pretty terrible when my hands got a little sweaty. Overall, I was not satisfied with my paperwhite.The new 7th generation kindle solves most of the problems I had with the paperwhite. The bezels are much more evenly glued on with this kindle. The lack of an uneven front light is also an improvement in my book. The material used for the Kindle is a hard, textured plastic, which I actually find much nicer than the paperwhite’s material. The thicker edges make it easier to hold while reading, and it actually feels more like a real book for some reason.There’s small details that I appreciate as well, such as the kindle logo being black. This makes it nicer to read with, as the kindle icon blends in with the rest of the bezel. I originally thought the new kindle had a capacitive touch screen, and it was almost a deal breaker for me when I realized it was infrared. However, the touch screen is actually much better than I expected. It is implemented very well in this device, and it is as responsive as on the paperwhite. The bottom bezel is also bigger than the paperwhite’s, making it a good place to rest my thumb while using the kindle.As for the new kindle voyage, my main gripe is the price. There’s no way I’m spending $200 for a single purpose device. The glass display also means it doesn’t have the lay on the table design inherent to the standard kindle. I don’t care too much about the higher PPI or haptic feedback or any of its other selling points.I purchased my unit on Black Friday for $50 from Best Buy. At that price, this thing is a steal and is almost an impulse buy. As long as you're ok without a built in light on your e-reader, the basic kindle is highly recommended. I guess there’s a reason half of all kindles are purchased as presents, but that’s not for me to talk about in this review."",""Like that one toilet paper brand, less is more.""";;;;;;

"4.0 out of 5 stars,""Great ereader got it in the Prime day sale for only $50. I do recommend getting a light maybe a case if you are going to travel, take it to school, or just clumsy like me. The reason I gave four stars was beacuse when reading inside with a light I still got a glare its not  bad enough to interup my reading but it is a  disappointment. If you have a light close up it can glare but outside or with a  ceiling light it is great! It also depends on the angle with close up lights the last pics are with the same light as second just different  angle. I wish that I could turn off one click payment on kindle store. I had to turn Kindle store completely off in parental controls so that if my kindle got stolen the couldn't use my one click payment method. I just get Books on my computer instead and send them to my kindle."",Great but not Great";;;;;;
1.0 out of 5 stars,I lost my old kindle.  I don't like this one like my other one.  If you power it off it does not save the place where you left off reading- even when you use the book marker.

"1.0 out of 5 stars,""I absolutely hate the 7th generation kindle. The touchscreen is very sensitive and turns the pages so quickly that if you accidentally touch it, you can find yourself many pages ahead. Very discombobulating. And I really, really miss the buttons on the side to turn the pages. The screen seems to be more electronic looking than the traditional e-ink display. I definitely think amazon should make a kindle with these features, but not the base models. This kindle lacks the simplicity of previous generations."",Hate the 7th generation!!!";;;;;;
"2.0 out of 5 stars,""The more """"Gadgets"""" they keep adding, the less convenient the device becomes as a reading device.- touch screen: why? the big buttons we had on the side worked GREAT.

"4.0 out of 5 stars,""It is perfect in that I just wanted an e-reader with no distractions so I focus more time on reading, and one I could slip right into my purse.

I recently ordered a clip on reading light - I think this will help immensely and bump it up another star for me. I didn't realize that you cannot read in the dark with the Kindle Glare Free without light in the room or a reading light.

"1.0 out of 5 stars,""Had I never owned another Kindle, this most likely would have received a higher rating. Unfortunately, in comparing it to my older Kindle, the """"benefits"""" of the touch-screen technology can't compare to the features no longer there. For those of you unfamiliar with the older Kindles, nothing was touch-screen and, instead, was all keyboard/button-driven, with the keyboard built-in at the bottom of the Kindle and the page turning buttons on both sides of the device. Yes, it was a bit larger and heavier, but it was SO MUCH EASIER to use than this new one with more features that are only available with a built-in keyboard.I bought this to replace my older, ailing Kindle, hoping the new one would fit into the old cover that I bought with a light in it and loved. Not only does it not fit, there is no lighted cover to go with this new Kindle even available. Considering how expensive that old cover was, I wonder if all these different sizes and non-compatibility issues are ploys (planned obsolescence) on Amazon's part to force customers to have to spend a lot more money than is necessary.Pros: lighter weight"; more secure in the separately sold cover;" if it’s being used only for reading and nothing else (such as highlighting, games, etc.), it works wellCons:- Other than turning pages by tapping on the R or L side of the display, I haven’t found much about this  new Kindle to be very intuitive (easy to figure out). Reading the 62-page “Kindle User’s Guide, 2nd Edition” is pretty much a requirement. Although this guide comes with the purchase, it would have been nice to be able to just start reading rather than spending hours figuring out the new features.- The new highlighting feature is so unusable, it may as well have been removed:  Instead of highlighting, it literally darkens the selected text, making it HARDER to read. In my old Kindle, highlighting underlined the selected text, which was nice - it stood out, without impairing legibility. In addition, have not found a way to highlight across pages. i.e., if a section to be highlighted spans more than one page, there doesn't appear to be a way to extend the highlight beyond the current screen. The only workarounds I’ve found is either to separately highlight each page or to decrease the font size small enough to get everything onto one page. The problem with the latter is it becomes MUCH more difficult to then accurately select the section desired. The fingertip is now proportionately so much bigger than the screen, it tends to select 2 or 3 lines above or below what's wanted. Time-consuming and frustrating.- Certain games no longer work because they require a “keyboard.” The game and the virtual, touch-screen keyboard will no longer fit on this smaller Kindle. Amazon will refund you for what you paid for the game in these cases, but I’d rather have the games work.- For all the features lost with this new Kindle, you’d expect the new screen to be larger than it is. Actually it’s the same width as the old one and a tiny, tiny fraction of an inch longer (almost indecipherable).- For reading purposes, have not noticed much difference between this supposed """"Glare-Free"""" display and my older Kindle. Even reading in the car on a sunny day, there's not much difference. You can see more of a glare in the photo I added, but who regularly has that amount of light shining on the screen?I have another 2 months to decide whether or not to return it. Since it was bought for me as a gift, I’m disinclined to do this. And if I’m using it primarily to read, it works – except for the highlighting, which I used frequently on my old Kindle. I consider this an inferior facsimile. I hope this is not another case of Amazon sacrificing features for the sake of profit."",No comparison to older Kindle";;;;
"4.0 out of 5 stars,""I am working on an ambitious project to study and learn five languages.  Happily, I have been able to download over 900 free foreign language Kindle books and purchased the new Kindle to help eliminate distractions from reading on a computer.The Kindle is much darker than I expected.  I had hoped to be able to read Wikipedia on the device but that is out of the question even with reading glasses. I can read books fine because I can increase the font size.  A positive to the dark screen is that I can only see the picture and the title on the ads, so they won't have any affect on me.I find it more comfortable to use the blunt end of a pen than my fingers.  When I press on a word for a few seconds a dictionary will pop up in the language of the book I am reading.  If it is a dual language book, like Spanish/English, only the definitions for non-English words will show up, which is not a problem for me.  Of course, if it is an English language book, definitions in English will come up.  If you have WiFi you can also have foreign words translated into English or a choice of over a dozen other languages.  Very nice.When searching for a book you can't simply flip through the pages of all of your titles.  You either have to enter an exact page number to go to or you have to type in the first few letters of the book title.  This is especially cumbersome when you are sifting through hundreds of books trying to put a collection together.For under $3 I was able to purchase a previous  generation Amazon Kindle Touch olive green genuine leather cover from Ebay. The new Kindle snaps into the cover perfectly, however it is thicker than the last version so the cover doesn't fully close.  There is about a 1/2 inch gap at the opening but the cover will still protect the device if you slip it into a side pocket of a purse or backpack.  The covered device feels great when held open like a book with the leather exposed on the back or when flipped in half like a magazine and the inside fabric of the cover is  what you feel in your hand.I wanted a basic e-reader and that is what I got.  I won't be able to use Wikipedia but the dictionary makes up for that.  None of the other features interest me nor were they a selling point when I made my purchase."",Not perfect but it's what I wanted.";;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I have numerous Kindles, including the previous low end Kindle which I use for running around.  I like having an inexpensive, password protected device so that if I were to leave it somewhere, I am not out a great deal of money, and my credit cards are protected.  Also, the higher end devices have too much reflection to enable reading outdoors.  I don't take my higher end Kindle devices out of the house.I really didn't need this device, but I was curious about it.  I then ran into a note which stated that Staples had the device for $59 with a $30 rebate (Visa gift card)!  I ran to pick it up. (Available until 12/27, FYI.)It's a nice device.  The screen is very readable with good contrast.  The device and screen have a good """"hand feel"""".  It's heavier than the previous Kindle, but not by much.  With a lightweight case, it's very portable.The interface is really a pleasure, and I'm happy to be done with the scroll through keyboard which was on the previous device.  Everything on this device is done via a screen tap.The new device has double the memory, (4G as opposed to 2G on the previous device), and is developed to enable updates which make it the equivalent of a Paperwhite in functionality (without the light, of course).  So, minus the light, this device is incredibly well priced (even at full retail).If you need a light, check out the M-edge cases which have a slip pocket into which you can insert one of M-edge e-illuminator reading lights.  I prefer them to a clip on light.I use my Kindles for different things:  My Fires for films, gaming and sometimes reading, but for a true, enhanced reading experience, I use either my Paperwhite, my old Touch, or this new device.  I love the vocabulary builder function, as well as X-ray.  I often read complex books, i.e. mysteries or biographies, and X-ray makes it much easier to keep characters, terms, etc. straight.  I also have found that i prefer reading on a Kindle to a book.  I find that I finish books more quickly, and enjoy having the ability to read for a few minutes while waiting for an appointment, etc.If you are new to Kindle, and want a great reading experience, this is a great place to start.  Also, if you need a gift, or want to introduce children to an e-reader this is an unbeatable opportunity!A couple of tips:Set up is easy, and takes just a few minutes.  If you don't want to set up social media, or join Goodreads, just skip them for now.  You can add them later.  You MUST be connected to WiFi to set up your device, so have your password handy if your WiFi is password protected.  If you purchase from Amazon via your account, the device should already be set up for you.The device shows recommendations on the bottom of the home screen.  This takes up a lot of space, which causes you to have to scroll through screens more often to view your library.  Go to Settings, tap Device Options, tap Personalize, tap Recommendations and you can turn them off.  This will double your home screen display area, and enables you to preserve the picture format for book display (as opposed to a list format).Questions?  Post, and I'll get back to you.Enjoy, and Happy Holidays!"",GREAT gift at a great price for the holidays and great reader! (Tips included)";;;;;;

5.0 out of 5 stars,I love my new Kindle. I love it because I read all of the specifications for the device. This device does not have a backlight. So if night time reading is your thing you might not like this version. This is a very basic Kindle that does not have many bells and whistles. Which is something I like because I own other devices like an ipad. 'This device is very easy to use and comes with a tutorial when you set it up. Even if you some how miss the tutorial it's easy to figure out how to configure the device the way you want it. You can link it to social media if that is something you want to do. I have linked mine to Good Reads but not Facebook or Twitter. It comes with a USB cord for charging but does not include the wall adapter. I knew this and plan to use the many wall adapters around the house. I purchased the one with special offers but I hardly notice them. Plus I saw an offer for a cheap book I may want to purchase in the future or at least get from the library. It's a feature you could use to your advantage.Overall this is a basic device and it does not pretend to be anything other than that. If you have used something fancier you may be disappointed. But for $80 you can't go wrong for a basic e-reader.,Love my new Kindle;;;;;;
"4.0 out of 5 stars,""[Update 3 November 2014. It's been a month and I'm happy to report my son has frequently read using this simple Kindle. He's still reading physical books from the library, but we've purchased several books from Amazon on this device and he's quickly and happily read through them. Due to the little 'smudge' that developed on the screen, I've put this in a case, and I hope no more smudges appear. Battery life has been awesome in comparison to LED devices, and nobody has had to interrupt their reading to find a charger, and it's been fully charged maybe 3 times in a month.]I bought this value-priced Kindle to solve a problem. My 9 year old son loves to read";" he will tear through a Harry Potter book in a couple of days. But, he has no interest in reading on a regular tablet whether it be one of the iPads in the house, or the Kindle Fire HD. Something about the experience, basically staring at a white lamp for hours, keeps him from enjoying it like he enjoys traditional paper books. But paper books are bulky, and accumulate, and get kicked around the car, and have to be returned to the library. Many times, I'd just prefer to have the convenience of an eBook.So, when this new generation of Kindle E Ink readers were announced, and at such a low price, I impulsively put in a pre-order. I could cheaply experiment to see if it was right for my son. This whole device costs less than the extended warranty on my iPad.When it arrived, I made an error. I powered it on. One of my children asked to see it, I handed it over, and when it was handed back, it had been set to German and was midway through the tutorial you walk through to learn the basics of operating the Kindle. Now my German has been completely unlearned since I was in college, so I was at sea. I needed to call Kindle support to get me out of there. By the way, Kindle support answered my call within a minute, on a Thursday afternoon, and the pleasent man on the other end helped me get out of the tutorial, and find my way to the comforts of American English.But I had missed the tutorial, and if there ever was a device that you need to absorb the lessons of the onboarding screens, it is this single button Kindle. It has one of the least discoverable interfaces you are likely to encounter in this modern era of app design. It's filled with secret taps in regions of the screens, and long presses to do something, and swipes other places. So it takes a while to get used to even if you've walked through the lengthy tutorial.But, even given that, my children, both my 9 and 7 year old, immediately fell in love with this little reader. I signed up for a month of FreeTime, so there was a little book content--not enough, but enough to get a quick taste--and I soon heard one of my favorite sounds: my son chuckling at a book. And then later, my daughter who has just recently gotten seriously interested in reading, borrowed it, found in a book a demonstration of drawing the book's cartoon characters, and was happily copying them from the display onto paper. Soon after, she asked me if the Kindle could be hers.So, I am favourably inclined towards this device. I've not been happy with Amazon's regular tablets, they have not stood up very well in my household when competing with iPads, but these E Ink single purpose devices are a different animal. By being better as a reader than a general purpose tablet: not being backlit, having ridiculously good battery life, being very lightweight, and being cheap enough that I don't have to worry too much about them breaking, they comfortably fill a niche in my family's technology needs. However, in no way is this is a replacement for a general purpose tablet. While it does have an """"Experimental Browser,"""" that is somewhat of a sad joke, slow, ugly and crashy, something you'd only find useful in an emergency. Nor is it a gaming machine, or even good for books where photographs take a big role or with odd layouts like books for young children. It has no sound input or output, so no audio books or text to speech. The screen doesn't even autorotate, although it can be put in landscape mode. This is a text reading machine. Period. But a useful one.But not a perfect one. A perfect device would instantly refresh like an LCD or AMOLED tablet, this E Ink device takes time to change its display--perhaps a quarter of a second--making navigation a clunky experience. A perfect device would have paper-white white backgrounds, this one has a decidedly grey background: for whiter, you will have to pay more. The resolution is just low enough that you can see the pixels in the fonts"; don't let this ruin it for you, read the words and not the pixels. A perfect device would have a more easy to access interface, maybe even a couple more hardware buttons, but a few hours of use will get you used to it and mostly forgetting the pain of learning. Whatever you do, spend your time learning from the onboarding tutorial.My extended family has been tough on E Ink Kindles. One of my brothers has broken two of the older models;" he had an unfortunate habit of sitting or sleeping on them. So treat this thing gently and never place it in a back pocket. Even this new one after a couple weeks of wear has developed a """"smudge"""" about the size of a lower case a towards the bottom left side.A perfect device would be on the Internet all the time, this one requires a Wi-Fi connection. A frequent traveler will likely find the Kindles with cellular service worth the extra upfront cost. Several years ago, I bought one of my brothers such a Kindle for when he was studying in Rome, and he used that feature all the time. This is a Wi-Fi only device and it quickly found a couple of hubs in my house, and I was able to enter my password and start downloading books from my account quickly. If needed, I could use my phone as a hotspot and get content on the go that way.The screen has a distinctly grey tinge, and fonts are very dark grey, so the contrast is middling. There are a variety of font options: Baskerville, Caecilia, Caecilia Condensed, Futura, Helvetica, Palatino, and a """"Publisher Font"""" which apparently allows publishers to embed their own preferred font or at least select it. Of these, Caecilia is the default and the best suited for the device's screen. It minimizes the slight waviness of straight lines caused by the limitations of the underlying E Ink technology. The combined effect is reminiscent of printing with a very good dot matrix printer (remember those?) onto fine recycled paper.I've subscribed to FreeTime for my children on my Kindle Fire HD in the past, and eventually dropped it for lack of interest from them. I've re-activated it for this device, but unless they increase the number of books for their age brackets, I will likely drop it again. Still, it's worth trying it out for a month, and if you drop it, Amazon will refund you whatever portion is left in the month.X-Ray is an interesting feature. I've started to read the original James Bond novel, Casino Royale, and it's interesting seeing a graph of how characters like Felix Leiter pop up, disaappear and reappear. Or a brief history of the Peugeot company. I've a feeling I won't be using this feature often, it seems like a distraction from the text, but perhaps for non-fiction it will end up being essential.The ads on the lock screen have not been annoying and I barely notice their content.There is no power adaptor in the box--part of the low price--but my house has dozens of USB charging ports, and it includes a decent micro-USB charging cord.To summarize, a fine single purpose device. Hard to navigate, but as a reader, you will spend hours reading, which it is great at and seconds navigating, so the tradeoff is acceptable. I like its low low cost especially as I'm handing it off to children, but many will find the upsell to the whiter versions with cellular service worth the extra money."",""Great, Once You Start Reading""";;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I had a second gen Kindle previously and upgraded to the touch with special offers. Offers aren't intrusive, just when I turn the Kindle off.

Also, you can now use the Kindle at any point in your flight and no longer have to turn it off for taxi and landing.

4.0 out of 5 stars,I seriously love the case and I wish I could give it like a 4.8 but they don't have that option.

Is it just me? Did I get a defective product?I don't care about touch screen and light. But I really can't put up with such slow machine."",Why nobody mention these problems?";;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""This is my first kindle. I own a lot of gizmos, but never owned a tablet or an ebook reader of any kind simply because I never had the need. My smart phone, laptop or desktop suited my needs just fine and there was never a need for an in-between device. This has now changed as I have found myself reading more ebooks and finding my smart phone screen too small and my laptop too unwieldy and too likely for my short attention span to stray into doing something else other than reading.The good: Opening the box the kindle was smaller than I thought it was going to be, even though I knew the size - it's not a bad thing. Having used it for a while it does feel about right to me. Another thing I was surprised with was the quality of the touchscreen. I was expecting it to be frustrating to use but it was rather pleasant. Further, I thought I was going to feel annoyed at having to touch or swipe the screen instead of using the side buttons as on previous models, but I have actually found myself not minding it.The set up was fairly straight forward and so is the general use of the kindle. Getting around is fairly intuitive for the most part and I think overall the kindle has been put together well (Though for some reason I find myself tapping the centre of the screen to get the navigational menu up instead of at the top of the screen which inadvertently causes me to skip forward. I don't know why I have this inclination, but it's annoyance. Not the kindle's fault at all, merely frustrated at myself).The bad: These are minor gripes, but I still feel I need to state them. Firstly, I'd like the power button at the top of the kindle. It seems really weird to have it at the bottom. Secondly, this isn't as annoying as the first point, but having a home button would be nice too. Having been trained by various smart phones and tablets to use the home button to get to start of something, I think this gripe would be probably shared by most even though it is far from a deal breaker. In any case, neither point is a deal breaker and I'm still really happy with the device."",Overall a great product for a great price";;;;;;
"4.0 out of 5 stars,""Okay, I'm giving it four stars just because my Kindle was the 3rd gen and this is pretty much the same thing. It gets the job done. Here is my issue: I don't mind it not being lit, but I do have a problem with there not being a cover available with a built in light besides some cheap third party ones that get so-so reviews. Yes, Amazon makes a clip-on light, but it is very inconvenient to have one of those. I got this as a gift and didn't realize I would have such an issue finding a cover with a light. If I had known, I wouldn't have opened the Kindle and would have sent it back to exchange for a Paperwhite. So, be aware that this can only be read in well lit areas since getting a decent cover and light for it is nearly impossible. So...good for beach reading. Not good for reading before bed."",Hard to find covers with built-in light for this - not for bedtime reading :(";;;;;;
"1.0 out of 5 stars,""I've owned 5 Kindles now.  The first one the battery would no longer charge.  The second one I dropped and the corner turned black which interfered with reading.  The third one I had sitting on the bed and accidentally leaned on and it separated from the frame and wouldn't work anymore.  And this one is the fourth one.  I've since ordered a """"used like new"""" Kindle like my second and third one because I hate this one so much I won't use it anymore.  Let me explain one thing.  I love new electronics.  While everyone is complaining about how it used to work fine I'm excited to see what they changed because more than not, I love it.  Not so this Kindle. First off I can't even begin to express how cheaply made this Kindle is.  It's light alright.  Because it's made out of cheap, cheap, cheap plastic. I can just envision it cracking with the slightest bang. I thought the idea of the touch screen was a great idea.  And no more typing on the tiny keyboard on the bottom that was designed for little mouse feet?  Wonderful.  Uh.....no.  While the keyboard is fantastic the problem is with the touch screen in general.  There are no longer tabs on the side to turn your page forwards and backwards.  Instead page turning is done by lifting your finger and tapping or swiping a certain area on the Kindle.  Half the time it's unresponsive and doesn't turn the page.  The other half it's either turning it in the wrong direction (and yes, I am smart enough to tap it in the correct spot).  I can't express how frustrating and annoying this is. And if you're like me and read in bed, I lay on my left side and hold the Kindle with my right hand.  When they had the tabs on both sides, backwards and forwards was equally accessible.  Now, if you have the Kindle in your right hand and want to go back a page you must reach all the way across to the other side of the page to tap the small area designated for turning the page back.  On the other hand (literally) if you're on your right side and turning with your left, you have to reach across to tap the area to move forward and try and avoid the area designated for backwards.  And half the time you're turning the page in the wrong direction. And if you are like me and like larger print, you are constantly lifting your thumb to tap the page to turn it. It also randomly changes your font.  And God forbid you need to lay it down during use and you happen to touch the screen or your cat walks on it.  When you come back to read it's either highlighted a word and the dictionary is up or it's changed your font or you're on a page that you didn't leave it on.  I just plain hate it.  I see the new Kindle now has page sensors on the side similar to the original ones.  I must assume from this that I am not the only one who hates this design.  I was thinking of purchasing one of those but they don't look """"ready for primetime either"""".  There are a multitude of complaints that they had a two-toned colored screen. And the """"touch screen"""" on this one reminds me of an old Pantech phone I had that was supposed to have a touch screen like a smartphone.  No, no, no. Not even close.  It's not responsive like a touch screen should be.  It lags and is super frustrating. So I just spent 79$ on this piece of garbage and I really don't want to invest another $200 in something else that will aggravate the hell out of me. So now I ended up buying an old Kindle for $83.00.  Not happy with this at all.UPDATE:  I contacted Amazon and got a full refund with no hassles. I'll be sending it back shortly. And I got my new """"old"""" Kindle today and am soooo happy.  What a relief.  I just hope it lasts until Amazon can figure out that we don't want to do gymnastics to turn pages and would like to be able to actually touch the screen of our Kindle to lay it down without it spazzing out."",The only Kindle I've ever actually hated.";;;;;;

The back of the new Kindle is also poorly designed, as it has a ridge along that juts awkwardly into ones hand, unlike the smooth-backed Kindles of old. I guess I will have to hope my old Kindle has some more life left in it or that the Kindle Voyage turns out to be as worth the price.

My justification for buying a new Kindle was this ... if I get a new one and keep the old one in my name, then when I buy a new book, he'll also be able to read it.

That one was stolen, and I was very disappointed to learn that that style was no longer available. It was so simple to operate, and had none of the extra sensitivity that this touch-screen model has, which frustrates me a lot. You have to touch it with just the right amount of pressure or it does something you don't want it to do. Everything is different about this Kindle and I don't like any of the difference. It is not an improvement as far as I am concerned, quite the opposite. But, I had no choice, and I don't like that either. I find it difficult to touch the screen just right and in the right place to go to the """"home"""" site, and an incorrect touch often brings up a message of some sort that I did not want. I've had it for three weeks and still don't feel comfortable with it. Is this enough of a review?

"1.0 out of 5 stars,""This isn't so much a review of the product, which is fine, so much as a review of Amazon's advertising. I received an email from them telling all the features of their new Kindle Voyage, and boy, did it sound great. The whole email was all about it with pictures of only the Voyage. Then at the bottom of the email is a large button that said, """"Buy the new Kindle for $79."""" So, my birthday was coming up so I forwarded the email to my wife. She thought it looked great and ordered it. It shows up around my birthday and we're both wondering why it's thicker than the ad and what happened to the backlight. Go back to the email ad and see that the Kindle she ordered is just called """"Kindle"""" but the more expensive models, like the Voyage ($200), have names. To us, they are all Kindles. I wasn't about to send it back, cause it is pretty neat, but I have to read at night with the light on. In closing, Amazon, you get one star for sh***ty advertising."",""Great product, deceptive ad""";;;;;;
"3.0 out of 5 stars,""I recently upgraded my Kindle 5th Generation(side buttons/multi-directional keypad) to this current version touchscreen Kindle because Amazon was offering a trade-in on the old kindle plus $20 credit plus towards a new one and a $20 discount off the regular price. After all of that, it only cost me $6.39 which seemed like a perfect time to upgrade! After spending some time with the new Kindle, I came away with mixed feelings with this new Kindle compared to my old 5th Gen Kindle.My initial impressions are it’s of similar dimension to my old Kindle, but more chunky and feels a bit heavier overall. Holding it in one hand, I notice that the all plastic body is quite slippery and not really grippy at all compared to my old Kindle, which is a bummer. With my old Kindle, I would be able read it in one hand and turn pages as well. With this new Kindle, it's a challenge to hold it in one hand for any extended amount of time to read without it slipping out of my hand. Also, it's a bit uncomfortable to hold because of its chunkiness as well. I wish this new Kindle had a grippy material on the backside like my old Kindle did, which was slim and just much easier for one-handed reading. It seems that Amazon purposely designed this new Kindle to be put in a case as it's just not grippy at all to me and it looks pretty cheap too. I prefer to read without any type of case, but because of this, I may decide to go with a case afterall. The build quality/design also doesn’t seem quite up to par because it just comes off as a cheap-looking slab of plastic with not much of a design emphasis. So, I would recommend getting a case to aid in grippiness and to hide the drab look of this Kindle.The touchscreen looks very much like my old Kindle in size and clarity. This Kindle is suppose to have 171 PPI and “sharper and bolder text”, however compared to my old Kindle, I don’t really notice much of a difference. For comparison, I used a 5th gen Kindle from a family member and compared them side by side using the same page from the same book and with the same Bookerly font. I may even say that my old Kindle has a little bolder text compared to the new Kindle, which seems to be on the lighter side despite its claims to “sharper and bolder text” in its description. So the screen hasn’t impressed me much either.The touchscreen responsiveness is fairly good and the page swipes seem quicker than what I’m use to on the old Kindle, but not by much. Page swipes are done by actually swiping across the screen or just tapping in the left/right margin or middle of the screen. Tapping at the top brings up the menu with various functions and access to Settings, which is little more convenient than my old Kindle. One thing I’ve noticed is that the text on-screen doesn’t actually utilize the whole screen, depending on the book. The top margin starts lower than my old Kindle because of this “tap to access menu” function. That’s about an inch of wasted space in the top margin on every page which is disappointing to say the least, especially on a 6” screen. This doesn’t happen with every book for some reason, so this may be some glitch with a particular book. On my 5th Gen Kindle, this never happened at all, but something to note on this newer Kindle as it may be indicate buggy issues with the software.The storage is 4GB for even a 1000 more books, which is double my 5th Gen Kindle, but it’s not really important to me as I keep most of my books in the cloud and only keep what I’m currently reading and some other ebooks I may read down the road on the Kindle. Once I’m done, I usually keep any purchased  ebooks but not obviously any borrowed ebooks from the library. I will never have a need to keep my entire library of ebooks on the kindle at one time unless there some type of apocalypse happens that lasts years and years. If that happens, the kindle would probably be fried anyway";")Battery life seems to be similar to my old kindle as I’ve not had to charge it yet as of this review. It came shipped with about 60-70% battery life. Hopefully, it will last as long as my old Kindle, time will tell.I do like some of the new features like being able to browse through page by page or chapter by chapter without losing your place in the book. This is probably the best new feature of the Kindle that I didn’t have on my old version. The Goodreads collaboration, X-Ray, Word Wise, Vocabulary Builder, bookmarks with PIP preview and “XX mins left in chapter” are some of the other various new features that I like as well. All of these can be accessed while in book without going to the Home page, which makes it more convenient. I do wish there was a toggle at the top menu bar for airplane mode on/off instead of needing to go into settings like my old Kindle. I’m usually on Airplane mode, but there are times that I need to go on WIFI to download a book or sync my progress to other devices.So I would probably recommend this 7th Gen Kindle for someone who doesn’t have an eReader or are new to eBooks and want something relatively affordable. But if you're thinking of upgrading your existing 5th Gen Kindle and is working fine, I would hesitate to recommend it because of its poor build quality, drab styling, slippery feel and grip and underwhelming screen. If you need the new features and don’t care about any of the previous mentioned cons and just want to stick this in a case, then this may be the Kindle for you, especially if you can get it at a good deal like I did. But in my opinion, at $79 or even $59 on sale, this is not really worth it if you have a good-working older kindle. Also, there is the Kindle Paperwhite, which has a better screen with built-in light but at a $40 premium, still may be worth considering if you're serious about eReaders. For $6.39, it was a very small investment for me that had some upgraded features but came with flaws as well. Now, in the mean time, I’ll be searching for a nice case to cover up the Kindle..."",Upgraded from a 5th Gen Kindle but with mixed feelings...";;;;;
"1.0 out of 5 stars,""In a comparison with my 4th generation basic kindle (who has now passed on after ~3 years), this product is inferior in nearly every way.It feels and looks a lot more clunky";" you're gaining a noticeable amount of weight and thickness in exchange for a touchscreen feature. The purpose of purchasing a basic kindle for me at least is to read, plain and simple. I only have two requirements for the kindle: 1) small and lightweight, and 2) easy page flipping. Any advantage gained by touchscreen is far outweighed by the loss of the page buttons.I experimented with a number of hand positions, and even though I could flip pages with my thumb if I really contorted my hand, it seemed a decent portion of time I'd highlight something instead. Attempting to do flip back a page is 10x harder.I read with both my kindle fire and the basic kindle-- the basic's niche is that it is lightweight and portable, and provides easy 1-handed use. This product fulfills none of my requirements.--I would recommend the Paperwhite or the Voyage. Personally returning the basic for one of those."",""Horrible design, tempted to smash with hammer after 1 hour of use""";;;;;
"3.0 out of 5 stars,""First off, I would like to share that I owned the kindle keyboard, the kindle fire hd and now I have the kindle hd 6, so I have had experience with a few different models. I purchased this model, because I wanted a reader I could take outdoors when my children were playing that wouldn't distract me from reading like my kindle fires end up doing.This model is very basic. It's good over all. The touchscreen works very well and it does what it's supposed to do, but I wasn't happy with the darkness of the screen. I felt like I needed a little more contrast between the background and the actual font.I ordered the paperwhite to see if the difference would justify the extra expense. For me, it definitely does. The background light makes a huge difference. I'm sending this one back and keeping the paperwhite.All in all, it's a great reader for the price, has all the basics. Just not the reader for me though."",""Good, but basic...""";;;;;;

"4.0 out of 5 stars,""Overall, I am enjoying this a lot.  One thing I don't like however is that the screen is extremely sensitive and even the tiniest of touches will advance the page and lose my place.  Also, the part of the screen that you press to go to the previous pages really only works reliably once.  If you want to go back two pages at a time you're almost screwed.  It has been hard for me to figure out how to do that as the device wants to interpret the second touch as a """"go forward"""" command and you wind up going in circles.In the plus column, I am VERY happy that amazon has continued the e-ink format.  I read ten times as much when I don't have glare giving me a migraine."",One thing I don't like however is that the screen is extremely sensitive and ...";;;;;;
"4.0 out of 5 stars,""I purchased this to supplement a 1st generation iPad mini. It's exactly what I expected to be: a simple device to read e-books on so I don't stare at an LCD screen all day, especially in situations where tablets get too much glare. The build quality though does feel a bit on the cheap side coming from a higher end tablet, but for $79 it's fine.Amazon's integration with Overdrive is great too for checking out library books. The ads on the lock screen really aren't too bothersome at all."",What I expected";;;;;;
"3.0 out of 5 stars,""I previous had the Kindle Keyboard and was devastated when after 5 years of use the screen had some major issues that couldn't be fixed. Please note I travel constantly and even though I always kept it in a case it definitely had some tough love but worked great up until the end.The new kindle has the same great screen without glare.  It's easy to navigate to order books, use the dictionary while reading, highlight quotes in books and set up wifi(however it was easier to turn it on and off on the Kindle Keyboard interface).The one major downside to the new Kindle is the touchscreen sensitivity.  I frequently read in bed and if my blanket grazes the screen it changes pages, font size or resets me to the beginning of the my book.  There's no adjustability that I'm aware of in the settings and every night when I read I miss the buttons to turn the pages."",Screen Is Way Too Sensitive";;;;;;

"3.0 out of 5 stars,""It pains me to say that I only have a single major complaint.  Otherwise this feels like a 5-star product.The grey screen is too dark.  It is too dark in dim light, and it is too dark in bright light.Here, at my computer, in my """"normal lighting situation"""", the room is dim.  I'm using the light from the lowest (13W) settings of an 3-way efficiency bulb in a shaded lamp, and have the glow of two monitors.  This is just enough light for most things, from balancing my checkbook, to looking up which special characters I used in a particular password, to, yes, casual reading.  This is enough light to read white paper by.  Now, grey paper, when newspaper or IRS tax booklets may indeed need more light, which is fine, because I have two more clicks on my lamp.  So, I have suffered mildly trying to use my kindle in this dim situation.I had thought, fine, I'll just have to use this in bright light.  Alas, that doesn't work well either.  Being in a bright room naturally constricts my pupils so that I need more light.  The contrast on the kindle is thus effectively worse.  Looking around the room, everything is bright and cheery, until you look at this device and I wonder what this murky grey thing is doing here.  I have to concentrate to read it in bright light too.  In bright situations, if my eyes are adjusted to reading on this, then I actually feel the need to turn down the lights in my environment.To repeat myself in summary, the grey kindle screen is too dark in dim light.  It's too dark in bright light.  Great product otherwise."",The grey screen is too dark.";;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I received the Amazon Kindle on the release date of October 2.  Thus far I have been very happy with it.  I have the Kindle Fire and the Kindle Fire HD and have been pleased with them.  However, I wanted something that was more exclusively an e-reader with the glare-free screen that I could take with me on the go for reading.  I have my smartphone with me when I am out or at work so bringing a Kindle Fire with me seemed redundant.  I also rationalized my purchase of yet another Kindle by the fact that when I read on my other Kindles, I am easily distracted by the other apps and end up spending too much time with those rather than enjoying reading.I like the screen and the size.  I find it much easier to read than my other Kindles, even with their matte screen protectors.  The touchscreen is a nice addition with this version.  I am used to this with my other Kindles so it is an easy transition.I also like that you can organize your books.  That is something that I had longed for with my other Kindles.  I think it will be nice to file away the books that I have read and the books to be read.  I can think of all kinds of possibilities for this feature.  I had been considering the previous generation, which I think was $69 as opposed to $79 and I am glad that I waited.I may update when I have had the product longer."",Kindle 7th Generation with Special Offers";;;;;;

"3.0 out of 5 stars,""I had the kindle a generation before this one which I loved, but it broke one day after a friend sat on it... I thought that the new generation could only be better, but I was wrong. The last generation was thinner and lighter. Though this generation is still pretty light, its heavy enough for me to feel that itd slip when only holding it with one hand. (Granted I have small hands.) Also, the black framing looks thicker and the screen looks smaller. I feel that the touchscreen is unnecessary for a simple ereader, especially if you use it mainly for reading and not for taking notes, which is what I do. I loved the buttons on the side used to change pages in the previous version, but they have been changed to swiping. The layout of the home page, etc is more cluttered now if I'm remembering my old kindle correctly. It might be weird that I'm complaining about it having more functions, but I feel that a kindle ereader should stay simple and do its job: be as portable as possible, be efficient to use, and show me my books. Anything else is superfluous and you might as well buy a tablet."",More is not always better";;;;;;

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""This is my second Kindle, an upgrade from a 2nd generation keyboard model. It still worked, but the Prime Day deal was irresistible. I am so glad I took the plunge. The new Kindle is lighter and smaller, but has a larger reading area. Handling it is similar to a paperback, once its in a case. Open it, and you see the last thing you saw when you closed it. How easy is that? I find the text to be as crisp as traditional print, and the contrast with the background less fatiguing on the eyes than my previous Kindle. I tend to be a binge reader, so that makes a big difference, as does the lack of a backlight. The frame is far less distracting as there are no buttons or letters to draw the eye away from what you are reading. Despite being in black and white, the pictures in my cookbooks are rendered in enough detail to be appealing.  It's like looking at the pictures in a mass-market paperback. It's no coffee-table display, but it gives the general idea.The user interface is invisible, yet always close at hand. One tap and I can navigate, check references or definitions, see where I am in the book and how much is left, or simply check the time, without leaving the page or picking up another device. The gestures are intuitive, if you're accustomed to a smartphone or tablet, so there's no learning curve. It comes already linked to your Amazon account, so upgrading is mostly done when you get it. It took about ten minutes to open the box, put it in the new case, set up the wi-fi, and download my collections and books from the Cloud. I appreciate not having to re-organize all my books back into their groups. Because it doesn't automatically download every book I've ever purchased, I don't have to waste space on the device on the few duds I've happened across. (Of course, if I'm desperate and near wi-fi, I can get them from the Cloud";" nothing is gone forever) Realistically, I'm unlikely to ever run out of space, even if I kept everything on the device. 4G holds a lot of text.Reading other reviews, I do think some people  have been unfair, so I'm going to address some common complaints. This Kindle does not have a physical keyboard. Personally, I think that's a plus. There are no fiddly little keys or clicky navigational arrows. You can swipe, tap or slide anywhere on most of the screen and it turns the page forward. Touching along the left margin will flip back. If you miss the keyboard that much, Amazon does sell laptops. Without the keyboard, apparently there are games you can't play on this Kindle. For game play a better choice would be a tablet, or a smartphone. This is a relatively inexpensive entry-level dedicated e-reader. The experimental browser is still lurking in the menu, and it has great access to the Kindle store, but it's nothing you'll spend hours sailing across the 'net on, unless you're desperate.Overall, this is fantastic at doing what it's designed to do. It's the perfect alternative to yet another bookshelf."",Excellent Purchase";;;;;
1.0 out of 5 stars,Really cheap product. Slow and difficult to use. You have to tap it so many times before the screen registers and changes page or goes to the library. Wish I would have just stuck to the kindle app instead of wasting money on this. Hate it.,CHEAP AND SLOW!;;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I've been an avid reader from the moment I first learned to read. This means over the years I have collected tons of books. Sure I've downsize plenty of times, gave books away to friends or donations but still somehow before I knew it I once again has too many books and no place to store new ones. It was a vicious cycle. So I as much as I was against them, I decided to get an e-reader.I originally had a nook color and that was my first introduction into e-readers. It was great for graphic novels and comics but not so much for actual novels. My eyes would hurt and strain from the back light and text. I also hated reading outside on a bright sunny day since all I would experience was glare. While for the most part I was happy with it (I could play games on it!) I was also extremely unhappy. Eventually my nook suffered extreme water damage, so I was then in the market for a new e-reader. I tried to save myself some money by reading on my iPad but I encountered the same problems as I did with the nook. Painful, strained eyes from the back light when reading for prolonged times and of course the dreaded sunny day glare (which those of us with iPads know that glare pretty much renders them useless since you cannot see a thing), plus my iPad is a bulky 2nd generation and because of the weight it gets pretty tiring holding that thing for a lengthy time reading. Because of my inability to comfortably read, I started buying physical books again... and once again ran out of room to store them.I started doing my research on some basic e-readers (such as the Kindle, Kindle Paperwhite and the Nook Glowlight). I didn't want one of the tablet e-readers since I already had an iPad, so why do I need all the bells and whistles? So, I compared each of the ereaders I was interested in and the Nook Glowlight was originally winning the race, since I had a whole library of ebooks purchased from Barnes and Noble from my previous device and the price was excellent. 100 bucks for basically the BN version of the Kindle Paperwhite. It was cheaper than buying the Paperwhite from Amazon... but then prime day happened.A basic Kindle (with special offers) for 50 bucks? SOLD!I had heard of the pricing when sales had leaked a few days before prime day and I told a few people I knew I was buying a Kindle. My husband pointed out a few things such as """"There is no backlight"""" - Well the backlight was my main issue with my previous e-reader and my iPad so no backlight? No problem! """"What about your previous Barnes and Noble library?"""" - I already read them all, I'll buy new books. Again, No problem! """"What if you want to read in the dark?"""" - I turn on a light! Problem solved! and last but not least """"Don't you think the special offers will get annoying?"""" - Nope, in fact something might catch my eye and it will serve more like a recommendation on what to read next. I had it all figured out. I was buying a Kindle.The day my Kindle came, I was so excited that I immediately set it up. I took advantage of a trial month of Kindle Unlimited so I started reading right away. I am beyond thrilled I made this purchase. The Kindle so far has lived up to my every expectation (granted I have only had the device for 5 days). I have no issues with my eyes hurting or straining while reading. I have been able to take advantage of a breezy summer day by reading in my backyard without an issue of glare from the sun. The photo I've included with my review is the clearness of the screen outside on a sunny day. I was so impressed with the lack of glare, I immediately took a picture with intentions of adding it to this review. The weight of the Kindle is practically nothing, so it doesn't become annoying holding it for a prolonged reading session. I'm also very impressed with the battery life. I've been reading daily for about an hour or so each day and I haven't needed to charge my Kindle yet (except for the initial charging when it arrived). I also love the ability to use amazon household to share libraries. My husband uses the Kindle app on his tablet so I am able to read what he reads on my kindle.I am extremely happy to have bought a Kindle which originally I would have never done so if it hadn't gone on sale during prime day. But I will admit that would have been so foolish because even at 79 dollars The Kindle (with special offers) is worth every penny."",One of the best purchases I have ever made.";;;;;;
"4.0 out of 5 stars,""I purchased the new (Oct 2014) basic Kindle. I just wanted a simple e-reader so that I can have all my books with me to read where ever I am.

I notice that everything is now stored on the cloud and you have to transfer the books over to the device.

I have never dropped my Kindles nor do I abuse them, so I decided this time to buy the basic Kindle on sale (thank you Black Friday) and when it dies then at least I will feel as if I've gotten my monies worth.I am disappointed that this Kindle doesn't have speakers and no longer offers the text-to-speech (TTS) feature. I was going to return it to purchase the Paperwhite but found it no longer offers the feature either.  I was so happy with all the features of my Kindle Touch.  It was such a pleasure to discover all that it did.  I could understand if Amazon decided to make a base model that didn't have all the goodies but to redesign Kindle models to take features away from us, so that we have to purchase the highest priced Kindle models for the TTS feature, just seems like Amazon is adding value to some of its customers by taking from the others."",Does What it is Supposed to but No Text-to-Speech Feature...";;;;;

I enjoy the feel of a paperback in my hands. However, I am in many Lit classes and the cost of books has been piling up. When this Kindle went on sale for $59, I decided I could finally justify buying this """"non-essential"""" item. I only got it yesterday, but I am so glad that I have it now. The screen is crisp and clear. I prefer it much more than reading on the Kindle app, probably because it is not back lit, so it is easy on the eyes. The battery seems to last forever. I stayed up hours reading last night. If I had been on my phone, I would've needed to plug it into the charger long before I wanted to stop reading. Though page turns are smoother on the app, turning pages on my Kindle doesn't jar me out of my reading experience at all. Some people complain about a lack of buttons for page turning, but I don't see the need for them since this Kindle is touchscreen. I'm already used to tapping to turn pages on the app, so, in this, the two are exactly the same. Additionally, I love the size. It's bigger than my phone, but not cumbersome, so it's easy to read lying in bed (with a bedside lamp on, of course). The only thing remotely negative that I can say isn't even about the Kindle itself"; it's about the need to separately purchase a power adapter. Don't waste your money on the official Kindle adapter. I purchased a universal USB power adapter for $6 that works just as well; there's no need to spend $20 on it. If you have a cell phone charger that uses an adapter, you don't really even need to buy one at all;" I only did for convenience sake. All in all, I am extremely happy with my purchase."",I enjoy the feel of a paperback in my hands";;;
"4.0 out of 5 stars,""Although I love Kindles in general, I gave this 4 stars mainly in comparison to the other versions available. I actually purchased this Kindle for my son and the Paperwhite for myself and I find myself now wishing that I had just purchased two Paperwhites.  The standard kindle without advertisements is about $99 and the kindle Paperwhite with advertisements was $119, but that extra $20 gets you a much improved screen and a reading light that really comes in handy.  The reading light is especially useful for me, because I read to my son when he goes to bed. My advice is to just buy the Paperwhite itself, and not worry about the case or charging adapter, because you could buy similar items of the same quality from other makers for much cheaper than the $50 and $20 respectively.  With regards to whether or not to get one without the advertisements (you have to pay extra to get one that is advertisement-free) I normally hate advertisements but these ones are really unobtrusive because they only occur when the kindle isn't being actively used.  I don’t own a Kindle Voyage, but I used a friends Voyage and I didn’t see anything that really justified the extra price.  The screens look basically the same, and the only major difference is the sensors that automatically adjust the reading light, which might be important for some people but probably not so much for most users."",Although I love Kindles in general";;;;;;
"1.0 out of 5 stars,""This Kindle is a replacement for my Kindle Keyboard, which bit the dust a couple of weeks ago.  I loved my previous Kindle model.  I loathe the new one.  With a burning hatred I find hard to contain.  The touchscreen is the MOST annoying thing ever.  However, if you've never used a non-touchscreen Kindle, you may have a different opinion.With my previous Kindle, I could hold the device anywhere and not lose my place in the book. If it slipped in my hands, grabbing it anywhere was OK.  With this one, ANY light touch to the screen changes something.  My ponytail accidentally touched it and some stupid window to change text size popped up.  I've lost count of the number of times it has jumped ahead several pages when I only tapped the screen once.The reason I purchased a replacement Kindle instead of using my iPad is because it's smaller, lighter and better on the battery.  But this Kindle sucks.  I miss the buttons to change the page, to go """"Home"""" or """"Back"""" or turn Wi-Fi on/off.  With my previous Kindle, I could hold it in my left hand while I ate lunch.  My right hand could hold a fork while my left hand could change the page.  Not with this one.  You have to tap the right side of the screen to jump ahead.  My thumb isn't 8"""" long so it doesn't reach the right side.So I will take apart my old Kindle to try to fix it because I'm this close to playing Frisbee with the new one.  If that fails, well, I don't know what I'll do but I'll still hate the new Kindle.  This will never change.  But I miss the buttons.  I'm tired of jumping through hoops for functionality that was once available with one key.  There's too much tapping for me."",""As a replacement for my Kindle Keyboard, this one sucks""";;;;;;

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I have debated getting a Kindle for a long time, but was never sure I wanted to give up on holding a real book and turning real pages. Well, I finally decided to try the basic Kindle, and I am pleasantly surprised how much I enjoy reading on this. I definitely read more now that I have the Kindle. It's comfortable to hold, there is zero eye strain, and overall usability is excellent. Having so many cheap or free books available through Kindle deals has already increased my Kindle library substantially. I bought a Fintie Folio Case and they are a great fit.Screen: excellent, clear, no eye strain, easy to readTouch: excellent, intuitive, responsive, turning pages happens subconsciously nowCasing: good, plastic, but not uncomfortable, maybe would have preferred a little matte finish for gripSpeed: responsive, no lag, page turns do not noticeably flash like the Kindle keyboard I tried out from a friend, which was distractingAs a former Kindle skeptic, I would recommend this to anyone who isn't sure they want to give up on real paper.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""On Cyber Monday I bought this Kindle and I'm very happy to report how pleased I am with this easy to read E-Reader. That very day of delivery I read a Nicholas Sparks book that I purchased. Love having a book at the touch of my fingers. Easy to turn pages, just a swipe with your thumb. The Kindle is so lightweight. Easy to use, easy and quick to download a book. It came charged also , which made it easy to immediately begin using. I love all the handy features that it provides. There is not a BACKLIGHT, you won't need it. It has a glare-free, easy on the eyes screen. Which is great for me. Reading on a computer is very hard on my eyes because of a backlight. It can cause my eyes to become bothersome and dry. A BACKLIGHT is hard on your eyes and can also keep you from sleeping peacefully.

"1.0 out of 5 stars,""I ordered the older version that has buttons and got the newer version with touch screen. That may seem like a bonus to you but not to me. Plus I paid for postage when I bought it and then had to pay postage to pick it up at the post office. That didn't make me a happy camper. The reason I wanted the older generation with the buttons was because of a medical situation that just makes buttons easier, it seems they are phased out and even though the device that was pictured had the needed buttons and was referred to as """"previous generation"""" I still got the newer model.

I still use my Kindle keyboard, but after trying this one, the old girl is now feeling a little slow and little washed-out and I'm thinking of upgrading to the paperwhite soon. I don't imagine many of you are first-time Kindle users, and many may be wondering if the latest Kindles are worth the upgrade. I wondered the same myself and I'm just here to tell you that after using it, I'm now convinced that the better refresh-rate, contrast, blacker blacks and whiter whites and lighter weight are worth an upgrade.Kindle units in general have changed my life for the better and I have totally forgiven Amazon for losing $9k on their stock back when I was younger.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I've owned 2 Nook e-readers over the past 5 years or so. In that amount of time, I've bought close to 200 e-books. A few months ago I started comparing the price of Kindle e-books with Nook e-books and I've found that Kindle is usually $2 to $5 cheaper than Nook and at worst, the same price. For the books I read, I have yet to see a Nook e-book cheaper than Kindle.As a result, I felt like I was just wasting money buying e-books from Nook so on cyber Monday, I bought the cheaper Kindle for $49. I'm assuming I'll make up for the price of the Kindle within 3 or 4 months a little at a time every time I purchase Kindle e-books.A little bit of a learning curve was involved with this. The Nook was touch screen and this is touch screen. Little differences in functionality but easy enough to learn. I will only be using this Kindle to read books so didn't want or need any of the Kindles that have more bells & whistles.

It truly is a glare-free screen, so I can read anywhere.  I think the only thing I miss on this Kindle is a headphone port for audiobooks or text to speech, but because books can sync across devices, for the times that I want to listen to a book I just use my phone instead of the Kindle. This is a really lightweight device that isn't super fragile, so it is easy to take it places (like waiting rooms) and not worry about it getting broken in my bag on the way there.

A week after owning my Kindle we had a Tornado watch, in which my family gathers in a safe spot until the watch downgrades to a warning. All my mobile devices were occupied by other family members waiting patiently for the storm to pass, so I picked up my Kindle and began to explore.I began reading and immediately paid attention to the line numbers, page numbers, percent completed, and estimated time remaining. Cool! I activated WordWise, which identifies key words, sentences, characters and events and gives me a brief summary. When I go a few days without reading, WordWise can quickly remind me where I'm at in the story. Neat! Kindle also never loses my place whether reading on Kindle, my iPhone, iPad, or desktop PC. That's convenient! Lastly, I can store hundreds of books on my Kindle, and infinitely more in the cloud, so there's no bulk besides the device itself.

There is absolutely not glare so you can read your media in any circumstance that you might have to endure.  It is also easy to use and the pages turn with a flick of a finger.

"2.0 out of 5 stars,""Touch screen feature is unnecessary and problematic. And lacks a """"hold"""" feature which would remedy the situation.I had a kindle keyboard for years and LOVED reading on it. But unfortunately for the touch screen and minimal non-touch sensitive space on the Kindle Touchscreen leaves you with little place to hold it. I consider my hands medium to smaller. There should be plenty of room on this thing to hold it. But there simply isn't. Meaning your hand has to hold smaller space and can cramp up.The kindle keyboard was great because you could hold the kindle and if your thumb rested on the page, it wouldn't affect the experience. And even though the physical keyboard was hardly ever used, it gave you more space to hold the device.Honestly, the problem could be fixed with a """"hold"""" feature. If you remember iPods and cd players, they had a switch that when turned on, made it so buttons were unresponsive. So if they were inadvertently pushed, it didn't affect the experience. If the Kindle either had a physical switch or a mode from the software that made the kindle unresponsive until the power button or a specific corner of the screen was touched, it would completely fix the experience.But sadly the kindle Touch screen lacks this feature leaving me missing the discontinued Kindle Keyboard."",Touch screen feature is unnecessary and problematic";;;;;;

Yes, you need a lighted area to read in and you need Wi-Fi to download material. If you do not have Wi-Fi yourself, go to your local library or a McDonald's.  I did that with my first reader and that kept me going for 2 years.  Once I needed internet for college, I invested in Wi-Fi. As someone else mentioned, this is a great introductory Kindle.

I already stare at LCD screens all day so the e-ink is softer on my eyes. Why kindle? Well, no matter how you look at it, the Amazon ecosystem is top notch.So, how does the latest version stack up?  First off, the software is touch friendly and a little easier to get around.  You can long press a word to get a definition instead of navigating to it via a button.  You can press the top of the screen to get back to your home screen and choose a new reading material.  Want to read a book? Just tap it to open it.  Turn a page? Tap it and give a little swipe in the direction you want to go (swipe it left to go to the next page, right go back to a previous page. It works pretty well and seems very snappy. I would argue that the screen is not as sensitive as a phone or iPad, but that is a good thing.See, the touch can get in the way at times. I have accidentally turned the more than I ever did on my old Kindle.  I would almost be in favor of a hardware button to accomplish this. Kind of annoying, but I can live with it.  My other """"issue"""" deals with the sleep /wake button.  It is on the bottom of the device and I have accidentally hit that a few times while reading.  I wish that, while in a book,  Amazon would use the button to trigger a dialog box that popped up asking if that was an accident or if you really wanted to send the device into sleep.Overall, I am impressed.

It never glares and I can read it in direct sunlight. The screen quality is decent as well. You can see books and even read large PDF's. It just works. This device is fast and never seems to slow down. It opens books fast, it opens the Kindle Store fast, and it also opens Goodreads fast. The Kindle Store has the most e-books of any online store. The books/magazines are affordable and download quickly. When you open a book on the device, you can change the margins, font size, and the font style. The reading experience is quite nice. It feels like I am reading a very light and thin book. It does not hurt your eyes like an LCD on a smartphone or tablet, it is just like reading a book off of the real paper. The Goodreads integration is great and I like to use it a lot. It is good for writing reviews right on the Kindle after finishing the book. Also,​ it is good for reading other people's reviews and suggestions. You can even set what book you reading at the time. The keyboard contributes to both the Kindle Store and Goodreads. The keyboard, I think, is even better than the Kindle Keyboard. It is fast and responsive (Other than the screen) and can take actions quickly. It also pops up fast as well. This is THE best thing I have ever read on. It is even better than a normal book because it is so light and thin. I did not talk about some of the features because I do not personally use them. In conclusion, this is a great device for reading and I would recommend it to anyone even compared to other e-readers."",Best Reading Device Ever!";;;;;;
"3.0 out of 5 stars,""When my trusty Kindle III Keyboard finally seemed to be giving up the ghost, I finally decided to upgrade. I almost wish I'd bought a rebuilt Kindle III.  The new version's okay, but I'm not that crazy about the touchscreen feature.  Too often, I'll try to flick off a crumb or something, and find myself on a different page.  My cat even changed pages when she flicked her tail at the screen and hit it just right.  My major complaint, however, is that I can no longer listen to books unless they have Whispersync, and I can only get that where there's wi-fi.  That means, unless I buy the audio version, I can't listen to the book I've been reading while I drive or when I'm doing volunteer work at the VA.  Those spots are about as cold as you get.  The voice on my old Kindle was rather robotic and pronounced words strangely sometimes, but it worked.  I was able to listen to books in the basement of the VA while my arms were in a warm-sand treatment for carpal tunnel and arthritis.  Whispersync doesn't work down there, and reaching the screen with my nose isn't all that great when I want to change the page.The unit is also smaller than my old one, and is not made to fit into the same case.  I'm sure that's Amazon's way of selling more cases, but I can't afford one.  Overall, I wish my old one worked better.  It seems as though every time someone upgrades technology, they make it worse, not better."",Not as Good as its Predecessor";;;;;;
"2.0 out of 5 stars,""This Kindle -- the so-called """"new and improved"""" is a huge step backwards for me, from the older Kindle I had with the touch buttons at the bottom. With that one, it was super easy to navigate. With the older one, when I was finished reading a book, I simply sent it to the Archieves by pressing a button -- it didn't clutter up the main screen where I kept the lsit of unread books. And when I bought a new book, it showed up only on my main screen, and at the top of the list. And if I wanted to delete a book for good and not keep it either on the main screen or in Archieves, that was easily accomplished by pushing a couple of buttons.None of that is easily done on the new and disimproved model. Firsts and foremost complaint, there are no written instrucitons. What good is it to have instrucitons buried somewhere in your new device, without any instrucitons on how to access the instrucitons? Amazon quite sending out owner's manuels because that costs them a little money to have it printed outI on paper, so they save a little on each sale by not doing that.  But it makes it so much harder to try and learn how to operate the new Kindle without having the instrucitons at your side to help you. So now I will have to go to Amazon and buy one.  I can not delete a book, except to hook up the !@#$%^&^! thing to my computer and try to delete it from there. I can not seem to switch a read book out of the books queue to the cloud, so the books on """"Book"""" list just keeps growing.I could go on and on with complaints, but it is so bad----(how bad is it?) I have stopped even trying to use it, and have gone to a different e-reader instead. Too bad, Amazon. Too bad, Kindle. It was great while it lasted, but nooooooooo.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""This is my fifth Kindle.  All the others died of a shattered screen except my first generation and my Kindle Fire HD.  My first generation Kindle is simply so hard to handle and use compared to later models that it spends most of its time in the closet. most of my other Kindles were the keyboard type. (model D00901)  I loved them, but the screens were too fragile, and the four-way navigation switch was so tiny that I needed a special tool to use it. So, for my fourth kindle, I got a Kindle Fire HD.My Kindle Fire is an amazing device, but it has several drawbacks.  The worst drawback is that the moment I step outdoors, the screen goes dim and the faint image that remains is totally lost in the glare from the very shiny screen.  I have a handicap that prevents me from driving so I travel a lot by bus, which means that I spend a lot of time waiting at bus stops.  I like to carry a Kindle with me to read while waiting, so I need one that works outdoors.  It just happens that a local store happened to have a used touch screen Kindle on sale at a very low price.As other commenters have said, it came without a wall plug adapter, but this was no problem since I still had the adapters from the old broken Kindles, as well as the adapter from my Kindle fire HD.  All of these are usable on my touchscreen except for the first generation. In addition, my local supermarket carries a pack of various USB connectors and an adapter that works just as well, so I didn't have to send for an Amazon adapter.Going from a keyboard to touch screen did take some learning time and I am still learning some things.  Luckily, this Kindle, unlike the Kindle Fire, comes with a complete and easy to read users guide. the more I use the touchscreen, the more assured I am that I will never go back to the keyboard.You will need a couple accessories.  If you want to keep your screen clean and free of fingerprints, you need a stylus.  Basically, this appears to be an aluminum tube with a soft rubber tip on one end, and a pocket clip on the other.  unlike your fingers, the rubber does not generate skin oils and is easy to wipe clean of any dirt it may pick up.  Also, since the point of the stylus is much smaller than your fingertip, it is much more accurate.  I was able to order a pack of about twenty of these for a couple bucks from an auction site in china, which gave me plenty to share with friends and still have lots of spares.The one absolutely necessary accessary is a cover.  Your Kindle is a fragile device, and needs to be protected from rough handling, weather, and the other things in your purse.  There are many different kinds of covers available online and at local electronic stores.  First, pick one that fits your model of kindle.  Different models of Kindle have on/off, volume control, and wireless switches in different places. the wrong cover may prevent access to these switches.  Second, pick one that is very sturdy.  Mine came with a neoprene bag which offered some protection from shock, but did nothing against bending stress. Bending stress is a main cause of shattered screens, and a shattered screen turns your Kindle into a very expensive piece of trash. The stronger your case, the safer your kindle is, so get the best cover you can afford.My touch screen Kindle is the best I've ever owned. For a person buying their first Kindle, or a person who wants a handy, go everywhere reading device, look no farther.  The only improvement that I would like to see is to make one with a seven or eight inch screen. I am a fast reader and would like one where I do not have to turn the page so often."",""(model D00901) I loved them, but the screens were too fragile""";;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""You read, you need a kindle! There is nothing like a kindle for reading. I have own every kindle there is and have tried every other reader around. My choice for reading is the plain and simple kindle. Yes I like the paper white and the fancy voyage for the back light and higher resolution. But there is something special in the plain kindle 6, it just feels and reads more like a book."",There is nothing like a plain kindle 6 for reading.";;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I got this thing as a refurb and it's basically brand new. I can see nothing that would suggest much use for sure. No problems with the screen as of now and the touch mechanism to me is working perfectly. Updating the thing was a breeze. So let's get into detail on the device...The normal Kindle I suppose is the poor man's e-reader at this point in Amazon's lineup. But I am waiting until the 16nm tablet revolution to get one of their high-end tablets. I didn't want to pay more than I needed for something that I just read text on, and the paperwhite seems to have its fair share of screen problems. This one was only 64 dollars base price. I got a used case to go along with it.For that price the device is positively charming. It's my first Kindle and I really could not ask for more. Amazon's software if very mature at this point, so you have a variety of fonts, readability settings, and core attributes to modify to your liking. After a couple minor fixes for my own personal use I was off downloading my entire Kindle on PC library. Easy. Fast. I could not ask for anything easier. The experimental browser also gets the job done. Bookmarks and decent website compatibility as long as it doesn't use too much Flash or Java. The device works perfectly for a college accessory and textbook device when needed.Not all textbooks are compatible with the lower end devices though. That was the only downside to the cheapest one in the lineup. My Glossary of Literary Terms was sadly not okay with this e-reader.Navigating and using features like highlights, x-ray, dictionaries, and the page functions took about 20 minutes for me to get the hang of it all. Again, everything is set up to help the customer get up and running very easily. The various swipes are easy to remember and incredibly intuitive at this point. I can flip, preview, cancel, and just all around enjoy the book I am reading without hardly any hassle at all. I for one did not think the page turning was too sensitive on mine. Seems about right for such a device. Amazon clearly has some very mature software here that complements the Kindle hardware in synergistic fashion.I don't use too many of the community features like Goodreads, but that is there for you too if you want to be involved in the gigantic Kindle community. Other great community functions that are less pervasive include notes on what people highlighted in the book, which I found to be a nice feature. And then you have other functions like about the book, which gives you some really nice info about what you are reading the first time.The one thing some people are going to not like is probably the storage. 4GBs is not really what I call enough space for the future. Luckily, I do have a lot of Delphi collections and my books fit on here nicely at this point. I have about 2.3GBs left after DL'ing 70 or so products. Amazon itself has its own helpful user guide for you to DL right off the bat, so if you do ever get lost that thing should save you a lot of time.The resolution of the display seems fine to me and very close to what you would get in a normal sized book. The somewhat dim display works very well for and is basically about the brightness of a normal literature page. I was comparing it to a bunch of my books and came away quite pleased with what they have here. Of course a bit more resolution would be nice, but for what is here you can still get fairly small fonts and good detail. This is not a reader for the dark, obviously.Anyway, I don't think there is too much else to say. I'll update the review as I go along, and take a note on battery life, but for now this thing is a great little device. Cheap, fast, easy to use, and all around a nice product to own with good and simple build quality. It sync'd up with my Amazon account right away and there was absolutely zero trouble getting this thing to work correctly. Highly recommended to those on a budget or to those that do not have any need for the higher-end tablets and readers. Unlike some of the other products, this one doesn't have any inherent screen issues, either."",A nifty device.";;;;;;
"4.0 out of 5 stars,""This is my fifth or sixth Kindle over the years. While I am a bit old-fashioned and love having a good old paper book, this kindle works for me. Life changes for us all, and mine is no exception. We downsized from a good-sized home in the suburbs to an apartment in the city. Gone is the luxury of having an extra room to serve as an office and """"library"""".I feel lost if I'm traveling without something to read. There always seems to be some sort of delay. Whether waiting for a plane or train, or just the doctor, having a book handy is always the perfect remedy. Having a Kindle is even better, because it's quick and easy to switch to something that I feel like reading at that particular moment.I have had a couple of the other """"glare free""""  or paper white kindles and have always loved them. They all met their end due to serious use, and ultimately, something dumb on my end. From pushing on a pen hard enough on my leather case to damage the screen underneath, to an unexpected swim in the toilet, I've broken a few. The second to last found me buying the Kindle Fire. Sure, the web browsing, colorful and glass (ugh) screen were nice. The biggest drawback was the battery that just didn't last and would run out when I wanted to read something the most. Did I mention I break things? Yup, that one still works.....if you can see through the cracks in the glass.I finally wised up and got what I realized I needed: a lightweight basic reader that holds all my content and the battery seems to last forever. It's not pretty, and sometimes it gets a little tricky to change pages as the """"swipe"""" isn't as crisp as the others I have had. Still, there is no glare like the Fire can have on sunny days. It's small, yet easy to read, with or without reading glasses as the font is adjustable. I use a light leather cover and it's held up very well, even to my standards.If you are looking for all the bells and whistles, keep looking. If you are looking for a portable, easy to use and see companion for your everyday travels and don't want to worry about your battery crapping out, then this model is something you'll appreciate. Great, functional tool for the job."",""Lightweight, no nonsense reader for a practical guy.""";;;;;;
"1.0 out of 5 stars,""After using this for over a month I've come to hold the opinion that the older Kindle models were much better.  I like to write notes, lists, etc. while I read and now that Amazon has disabled active content, I have to keep pen and paper near at hand.  I also like to read outside, or rather, I used to.  The touchscreen can be triggered by flies, so when I set my kindle down for a minute I often find I've lost my place because a fly had landed on the screen.  There are a few other quirks that are mildly annoying.  On the positive side, the battery life is good.  I wouldn't waste your money on this device, you'd be better off buying a cheap Android tablet and running the Kindle app on it.Update: The update issued in early 2016 has made the device defective.  After 1 hour, 46 minutes with support, they acknowledged the defect and I was told there was nothing they could do.  Basically, the made my device defective then refused to repair or replace it.

My favorite feature of the kindle is that it has a dictionary I can check for words I do not understand but it only works when it is connected to the wifi network.Durability - I've dropped  the kindle once the day after I got it and it just BOUNCED and it landed without scratches or dents. I believe it's made of high quality plastic that can absorb shockCON - The speed at which a page loads when you flip a page is not as snappy as you would have on a smartphone.

When the battery is gone I will probably switch to reading on the kindle app on my phone.  To be honest I don't even use this that much and the wifi is never on unless I am downloading something.

"3.0 out of 5 stars,""-- Pros --1.

See Con #1).  It's a bit snug and the auto on/off won't work because the PaperWhite mechanism is different, but at least it fits.

"2.0 out of 5 stars,""I have been a happy Amazon customer for over a decade, with a purchase history of six kindles for myself and family, but this touchscreen display kindle is NOT in any way an """"upgrade"""" from the previous version with buttons on the console.First, the kindle will, for no reason whatsoever, simply change the font size, usually from my preferred third smallest to the largest or, occasionally, again for no reason whatsoever, to the absolute smallest. It's a PIA.More an obstruction, however, is the sensitivity of the touchscreen. You can touch the right hand portion of the screen with your finger, in order to advance to the next page, but if your finger hovers a second over the screen, it will quickly advance numerous pages (as much as 10-20 pages), which makes determining where the hell you were immensely difficult. I am in the habit of reading my daily New York Times on the kindle, and this causes perennial problems.Another troubling aspect with sensitivity is how, by just holding the kindle, if your thumb or a finger touches the screen, you change the page or call up some feature.The touchscreen is such a problem that I have considered buying a used older version (that no longer is offered new), but the battery would be so old that battery life would likely be almost non-existent. I know that you can buy replacement batteries but that is a lot of work just to get a decent previous version of a kindle because the newer version is sub-standard.Amazon, you aren't Apple. I won't be buying your technology if it's introduced faulty from the get-go, especially when I can use other readers to do what the kindle does.I am leaving this review with two stars, not because I am pleased with the reader, which I have had for two months, but because I am managing to still use it, despite the impracticalities, although I will buy either a new non-Amazon replacement or an Amazon working upgrade soon.Caveat emptor."",Trouble in the Kindle Paradise";;;;;;
"4.0 out of 5 stars,""I give the reader four stars only because I give five stars only for a product that is truly outstanding. This Kindle reader is very good...but not outstanding. That said, it delivers for the price. Previously I bought the Kindle Voyage and own both an iPad and an android tablet. Without going into detail, each has a use for me (except for the old iPad). I felt I needed reader but did not feel like paying the price of another Kindle Voyage. This Kindle gives value for the price. A feature I like about both the Kindle and the Kindle Voyage is their size. I can stuff them into the pockets of just about any of my trousers, just as I used to do with my soft back books as a kid, and pull them out at any time. Navigating them is easy, however I have to say that I find my android tablet much more functional in this regard. But one must keep in mind, this is a reader, not a tablet. One needs ambient light to read, not with the Voyage, though, but cannot surf the net or take or download pictures as one does with a tablet. On the other hand, the Kindle sips energy. I am a voracious reader, so I had to charge my tablet daily. Not the Kindle reader. I can drag the thing with me wherever I go and pull it out anytime anywhere, confident that I will be able to tune out and read. I admit I do bang it around. Did the same thing with my books as a kid. Still, I did not buy the cover as I did with the Voyage. I wanted to cut down on its weight. This has proven to be a good call. At first glance, the screen seems miniscule, but after use one finds it quite sufficient. The font can be modified as well as the size of the print. To my delight, the Kindle also has the dictionary function that I used so much in my Voyage and tablet. I would recommend the old Kindle as an everyday knockabout reader to anyone."",The Kindle delivers for the price";;;;;;

I get a new one almost immediately and ship the old one back.Then, another few months later, it breaks again.

"4.0 out of 5 stars,""I have had this kindle for a few weeks now. I have grown to appreciate it for what it is. What I mean by that is this device met most of my expectations but I have found that I may have had unrealistic expectations. I had expected that it would have the capability to display books in color. It never occurred to me that a device made in this day and age would have a black and white ONLY display. This is not a complaint as such, just heads-up for others who might not have considered this. I re-read the description of this device on amazon and did not find any reference to it being black and white only. I could have missed it or they may have rectified it by now.It is, however, fantastically suited for text-based book reading which is, of course it's primary function. The fonts are a little chunky when viewed up close, but resolve themselves very nicely when viewed at normal reading distance. If the font size is increased slightly, it becomes very comfortable for my """"mature"""" eyes to read. It is useful even on low-light situations. It is easily much more legible than a book for reading in any given situation. It is much more comfortable to hold than most books. (I find myself over-bending the spine on my paperbacks so that I can clearly read the print that is near the fold.)The experimental browser has worked moderately well for basic internet browsing but is, of course also hobbled by the fact that the device is only black and white.I paid $20 for the ad-free version but received the one with ads. I contacted amazon and got an almost instant reply with an offer to refund the $20 or send me another. I opted for the $20 refund and am glad I did. The ads don't bother me at all and if I truly don't want to see them I can turn it off. I would almost say it is an advantage to have the advertising because it gives me ideas on what to read next.As a side note, I will post a picture that fans of the hitchhiker's guide will appreciate as soon as I finish my current project. :-)"",The facts as I see them in black and white";;;;;;
5.0 out of 5 stars,This is a really neat device but is way more complicated than the older versions. It is not totally obvious how it works and the directions are too long and complicated. Also I think that it is ridiculous that the plug is not included you have yo buy it. That is crazy but I do have a spare. Very small and light. May be a little too small although the screen side is the same I think. What is upsetting is every time you have to get a different Kindle the size changes so you cannot use your previous cover!,This is a really neat device but is way more ...;;;;;;
"3.0 out of 5 stars,""This is my second Kindle Touch. I lost my original one, which was a first or second generation model.  I was disappointed when I received the new one - the exterior has a cheap feel to it, and it lacks some of the features my first one had - like the ability to store and play mp3s, and having a 'text-to-speech' feature that allowed it to read to you.  Usually the later versions of Kindles improve on the earlier versions.  This one went backwards."",I was disappointed when I received the new one - the exterior ...";;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""The digital age of book reading has been great for me, a voracious reader since the age of seven. To be able to find, download, and begin to read a book within a matter of minutes is nothing short of amazing. When it happened, I could not make the switch from paper books to the digital variety fast enough.I purchased my first Kindle years ago. While I enjoyed reading books on it, the screen left much to be desired. Amazon’s early Kindle operating system was faulty in that it didn’t always recognize input when touching the screen. The new version for 2014 has rectified many of those issues, while maintaining its very small form factor, but it has not all together eliminated the touchy OS problems. There is still a notable lag when pressing a button on-screen, and there is also a delay in showing text while typing on the virtual keyboard. None of these or other minor flaws takes away from how great the Kindle is.IMG_5325The latest Kindle sports a 6-inch non-glare screen, in a very thin, small form-factor that is perfect for people who dislike bulky tablets. It has Wi-Fi, plus a 20% faster processor than the Kindle from 2013. A speedier processor means pages are redrawn faster on screen, giving an even more “like a book” feel to the Kindle.IMG_5326The Kindle on top of the iPad Air 2 for size comparisonThe improved battery lasts, and lasts, and lasts. From the time I started testing this Kindle to when I needed to plug it in for a charge was almost two weeks. Two weeks! Amazing.It is, however, not easy for me to recommend the standard Kindle priced at $79 when you can move up to a Kindle Paperwhite for less than twice the price. The KindlePaperwhite has a back-lit, or glowing, screen, meaning you can read it in a dark area. Not so with this basic Kindle review unit, which needs exterior illumination.pageA great Kindle feature is that all your books can stay on the same page, no matter if you are using Kindle hardware or a Kindle reader app on your iPad, iPhone, etc.While the text is not as crisp as I would like, it is still easier to read long-form than on a tablet, thanks to the E-Ink display. I get eye strain from looking at my iPad for long periods of time, but never with the Kindle.In the context of contemporary devices that do everything, it’s nice to have a purpose built Kindle that is designed to do one thing and do it very well: let you read! The Kindle family has seen many changes over the years, and keeps getting better and better. For the price, the Kindle is an easy choice to buy. If you use Amazon, and are a Prime member, there really is no excuse not to have a Kindle. Just save for the superior Kindle Paperwhite.MyMac.com review rating: 8 out of 10"",My MyMac.com Review";;;;;;
"3.0 out of 5 stars,""I got this for Christmas, so have been using it for about 3 months. I really enjoy reading most books on the Kindle. The text is very clear and, as advertised, works in bright sunlight. The screen also is designed so that you don't really notice smudges or fingerprints while reading. It's much lighter and smaller than a paper book so it's perfect for reading on the bus and I love that I can get ebooks from my library straight to my Kindle. The battery life is incredible (I can read quite a few novels before needing to recharge) and one of the biggest selling points of the device.However, it is not a robust device. I bought a sleeve for it to protect the screen and kept my Kindle in the sleeve whenever I was taking it anywhere. I still ended up with 3 scratches on the screen in less than 3 months. So I've had to put a screen protector on my Kindle, which means I no longer have a glare-free screen. It seems like it's either keep the Kindle screen as is, unprotected, and enjoy the glare-free matte finish but have lots of scratches or use a screen protector and read with glare but no scratches (except the ones that are already there from the 3 months without a screen protector). I am very disappointed that my screen scratched so easily because I was quite careful with my Kindle in general. Another thing that I find irritating is that lint seems to get stuck between the screen and the black plastic casing and is very hard to remove. This is more of a nuisance than a real issue until you go to put a screen protector on, then the lint creates air bubbles.Overall, I would cautiously recommend a Kindle to someone looking for an ereader, but I'm very glad I didn't spend more than $59 on it (bought during Christmas promotions). I would advise anyone to buy some sort of sleeve or case for your device immediately and use it diligently to avoid scratches on the screen. I'd also advise getting a screen protector--but give yourself a few days to enjoy how great reading on the Kindle is before compromising the reading experience with a screen protector."",Great for reading but screen is VERY delicate!";;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""Being my first Kindle, I chose the entry level priced model and am very happy with it.  I don't mind that it is not lit as I don't need to read it in the dark.  I love being able to download books to take with me on a trip - although I still take physical books with me too, can't help mysef :) - and I especially love being able to send my own material, either saved pdfs or inspirational material I've written for myself, to my Kindle via my Kindle email address as an attachment with CONVERT in the title.  I can't remember where I picked up this tip but it's a fantastic service.  I always keep my Kindle in my handbag because my idea of hell is being somewhere - even for ten minutes - without somewhere to read, lol.  I bought a Kindle cover locally and like that I can hold it more like a book, plus it's protected in my bag.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I won a Kindle 6"""" at an Awards Dinner, (as a door prize) ..... Lucky Me...  So I opened the sealed box and the unit was already turned on and was in Spanish .... It took me over an hour to get it back to US English,  since I can't read or speak Spanish.  I have an  8"""" tablet before this came along, so it's not new to me.  The thing I did like, with this, the battery last a long time, and it's smaller then my tablet and handier to read with, and use. The app used in his Kindle wasn't the best for selections of reading material.... I wanted to get magazines subscriptions just for the kindle.... but of course the app didn't or couldn't go there.  So then, I had to go on line with the computer, to check them out ....  After you set up your account  and register your Kindle with Amazon, You can buy your books and reading material and have it sent directly to your Kindle  (over Wi-Fi to your Kindle email address)  to read and have.  The Kindle will down load it on the unit for you to read... I thought was really pretty cool...A friend of mine said there where places or websites where you could get free books to read, so I am going to look into that soon, after I read the ones I have...Overall:  I think this the right size (6"""")  to have.... about the size of a paperback book.  The print can be changed to bigger or smaller so it's not a problem to read.  Easy to carry around and use. I love mine.  It's better then a tablet, because it doesn't light up the screen.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I was a legend in Elementary School for the number of books I read and spent hours upon hours of each day reading. I eventually taught myself to speed read in 3rd grade, and from 3rd to 6th grade I read nearly 1/2 of the books in the school library. I was a true book worm and have the plaques and rewards from my 6th grade teacher buried somewhere in a basement. As time went on I grew out of reading. Actually, I grew into other things. I still loved to read however needed to go to school, work 2 jobs, etc etc.Things in the real world have slowly returned to a calmer flow for me and I have really been having the craving to start reading again. I mentioned this and my wonderful, lovely fiancee ordered me a Kindle for Christmas. I have powered through 5 books since then and figured I have used it enough to write a review.My first impression when unboxing and feeling this, my first e-reader, I was shocked at the weight (very light) and the screen (not glossy in the slightest). It came with battery so I pressed the button on the bottom and it powered up. The screen flashes each time it redraws the image displayed, which was weird at first but now I really like it. Gives some feedback as to when you actually press the screen while reading.The screen is nice. Textured smoothly yet it isn't glass smooth like the Fire or Android tablets. Feels like a plasticy paper basically. I like this as well. Helps to remind of the old analog medium. There is some glare (or wash out perhaps?) when a very white light is shone directly on to the screen (IE: LED flashlight/lantern) however you can mitigate this by using a light that is not as bright.No backlight, no problem. I wanted something that was more like a book, not another gosh darned gadget. I have like 4000 different screens I stare at all day long and wanted something that didn't feel digital. I use an old school book lamp which is awesome considering I have had it since the late 90s.The Kindle daily deals are great. Tons of books, changed daily for like 2 bucks. How can you go wrong with that. The lending library is also quite nice, just one more reason to go with the Amazon reader vs the others.The only negative I have about this reader is that my fiancee has requisitioned the use of it as of this past Sunday and told me I can have it back when she is done. I do not know when she will be done with it, so I am ordering another one for me, and one each for my mom, sister, dad, and brother.Overall, I am sold on the e-reader wave. I'll definitely keep buying these things.Also, the Roocase for the Kindle Paperwhite fits this thing wonderfully and is WAY WAY cheaper than the Amazon case."",So good I ordered 5 more LOL";;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I wasn't too keen on the idea on getting an e-reader. Call me a romantic but I do love holding a physical books since it comes with perks that e-readers don't (ie: they smell nice, never die out on you, look beautiful on shelves in your room, can bookmark pages with awsome bookmarks,etc). But I've had to change my view on things since I've actually run out of room for all my books. My father had bought me a nook when those first came out but the screen made my eyes sore and it wasn't as enjoyable. And also my brother and me ended up completely ruining it, so it was time for a change. I chose the most basic of the kindles since all I really want to do is read and save space and money. I'm also super bad with technology and don't really need anything fancy. This kindle does the job. I absolutely love it. It's got so many cool features that blow my mind. It's feather light and super thin. So it takes up zero space. I can take it with me everywhere and so it allows me to read whenever I have time. This is honestly a pretty good investment if you are an avid reader with a book wish list that never ends. With the kindle you have a bunch of books at hand at a size smaller than a paperback."",Call me a romantic but I do love holding a physical books since it comes with perks ...";;;;;;
"4.0 out of 5 stars,""While I have a 5.5"""" smartphone and have used it with the Kindle Android reader app, I am finding that this Kindle is a more immediate media, and easier to read in very bright light, I am doing more reading of e-books.  This in combo with Overdrive access to library e-books, and the many e-books available on Amazon, especially samples (which give me a preview for books I'm waiting for), loaners, and freebie..I now have a wealth of material both downloaded and stored on the Amazon cloud.  The experimental browser is especially handy for reading news web sites and my e-mail accounts.  I'm hoping to see future updates that will make it more efficient in accessing all online material.  The unit is fast for reading, I like the link to Goodreads, the dictionary is handy, text options are adequate, the monthly free purchase of one pre-released e-book was an unexpected surprise, and the ads are not distracting...I appreciate that with the addition of ads the reader more affordable and available at a price point that made it attractive to me.  For night reading I can use my smartphone and the syncing feature keeps my reading progress seamlessly coordinated between the two devices.  For accessories, I also purchased a Verso E-Reader Clip Light offered on Amazon for $8.99, a discount available in one of those reader ads..it works great for both reading and as a handy bedside night light.  I also got the  FYY® Classic Slim Fit Folio Leather Case for Kindle at $6.88 on Amazon..I figured it would protect the unit while I used it traveling.  The landscape features of the case will not be used because this Kindle does not have screen rotation, and is only used in a portrait orientation.

"2.0 out of 5 stars,""I liked many features of this. I just wanted a basic device and according to the description this would be it. It would hold a lot of books, though I only read one at a time. It has a bookmark feature. You swipe to turn the page. So far, so good.Once I charged it and loaded books on, I found that I was having difficulty reading even next to a lamp. Changing the font didn't help. This version advertised that it was like reading the printed page- not so. The background of the page is gray. The text is a very dark gray, not quite black.I compared this with a paper book I'm reading and the difference was startling. The paper book was black-on-white. That's what I consider normal. Even an old paperback with yellowed pages has more contrast than this gray-on-gray device.There was no way to change it, so I'm sending it back and getting an earlier model Paperwhite.And before someone asks, yes, I did know this version wasn't lighted. But with an actual white background and crisp black text I wouldn't have needed a light, since I can read a real paperback just fine."",Difficult For Me To Read";;;;;;

I needed something to satisfy my need to take my library everywhere and something that wouldn't leave me with a migraine at the end of the first chapter. This Kindle was amazing for both! It is super light weight and portable, I've been able to fit it into relatively small wristlets and clutches. I take this everywhere with me and I don't have to carry a large purse to do so!!

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""My first Kindle was the Kindle 2. It was still pretty expensive back then, but I loved it! At the time, I was doing a bit of travelling back and forth between coasts and I was always either lugging a bunch of heavy books with me, or spending too much money at the airport for more. So, the price was justified at the time.My first upgrade from the K2 was the first generation kindle fire that I received as a gift for Christmas 2011. I was impressed at the time that the fire was a fraction of the price and was also a tablet.Unfortunately, my eyes just didn't like constantly reading on a backlit device, and i wanted more freedom in my tablet experience and passed that on to one of the kids.I eventually got an iPad mini and decided that I wanted to go back to a regular e-ink kindle, no frills. So, here we are.I love this kindle, because I wanted simple, no frills, no lights and that is exactly what this is. If I absolutely need a light, I use a clip on book light, or my iPad (which I can handle using the kindle app in short doses)I thought I would miss the keyboard and page turn buttons from the K2, but i don't. Flicking the screen or pressing the side work just fine for me.I also have back one of the features that I missed when using the kindle fire or kindle app - COLLECTIONS! I have all of my collections neatly ordering all of my books instead of a giant list or that annoying carousel.

"2.0 out of 5 stars,""I have a kindle Paperweight 2, a Nook Simple Touch, a Kindle Keyboard and now This Basic Kindle touch.Right off the bat I will say that this is the worst e-reader I have used.Why I dislike it:1. Its light but feels cheap, really cheap. It's boxy and ergonomically awkward to hold.2. The background screen is white, which is good but the font is somewhat blurry and smeary compared to my Kindle Keyboard which has sharper fonts and better overall contrast.3. Backround bleed. You can see previous page shadows on screen. The page sometimes doesn't fully refresh. I have tried looking under settings to solve this issue to no avail. Customer support says this is """"normal"""" My Kindle Keyboard and Nook Simple Touch do not not have this problem.4. Sensitive touchscreen. I love touch screens and i prefer them to buttons. I have no issues with this version not having page buttons like so many people demand. I personally don't care but the touchscreen is way too sensitive and glitchy. Any little slight touch will jump pages, bring up the menu and cause a complete distraction if your really deep into a book. Not cool.These are my main gripes with this particular Kindle Device. Yes, it is very basic and I do like that it has 4GB of storage as opposed to last year's model which has only 2GB (not that you will likely ever need 4GB but still). I do enjoy the lightweight factor but I think that anyone interested in an entry level e-reader should really consider getting a good second hand Kindle Keyboard or Nook Simple touch. I personally love the Nook Simple Touch and believe is better than this Kindle in every way imaginable although I would advise to stay away from the new Nook Glowlight as that device is severely limited unless you are completely immersed into the Barnes & Noble ecosystem.This Kindle is not bad but considering this is Amazon's 7th generation Kindle offering, I expected sharper fonts and better functionality, not to mention a MUCH better design. Yes this is basic but that doesn't mean it has to be cheaply made which this device definitely is.

I love the integration between Amazon and my library system so now borrowing books is a two-click process (I remember having to use a USB cable for the first few years they offered digital books, ugh!). I adjust the text size frequently depending on what or where I'm reading (at 41, I've discovered my eye sight is not what it used to be, and sometimes needs a little boost), I look up words on the fly...

I am elderly and beginning to have difficulty holding up books and the size and weight of my new 'Kindle, 6"""" Glare-Free Touchscreen Display, Wi-Fi' is just perfect!Once again, I have been completely amazed at the delivery speed of Amazon.com. I live in Hawaii where shipping times can be ridiculous, but never with Amazon. Orders always arrive just as estimated or even before.I also ordered the new NuPro folio type cover to protect my Kindle while travelling - it was $10 less than its Kindle counterpart and I am very happy with it.My only difficulty has been in finding out how to use all the amazing capabilities of this little gadget - Amazon's online instructions are somewhat cumbersome to use and I had trouble finding the instructions on my Kindle until I did some experimenting. Kinda wish there was a hard copy booklet included. But I am terrifically happy that I made this purchase (with small monthly payments), and I know I will treasure and enjoy my Kindle for a long time to come."",Love It!";;;;;;

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I've been watched Kindle for a long time, which was almost 1 year ago. My friends and colleagues have different kinds of Kindle: basic, paperweight or voyage. Finally I decide to get it because of a promotion at that time and I was happy with my purchase. I am not a native speaker, while Kindle helps me learn and explore more books in English. I like the size and weight of Kindle, as well as how easy and convenient to do reading anytime anywhere. My only complain is that the books need to be bought separately and some of them are not very cheap. Overall, I love it!"",""Awesome, love it!""";;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""The new Kindle e-reader was, and is, exactly what I expected. I purchased it to replace my old e-reader, which no longer worked. Because I got such good service from the old one, I declined the upgraded readers that were offered at discount, and instead ordered the closest thing to my old e-reader. When the new one came, I quickly put it to work, only to discover that it was defective, and worked no better than the old one. I printed a postage-free label online, making a request that it be replaced, not refunded. But when I got the confirmation, it noted that a refund would be given as soon as the returned item had been received. Because I wanted a replacement, not a refund, I called Amazon customer service to straighten it out. The response was swift, and exceptional. The representative not only understood where the mistake had been made, but corrected it, and then ordered a replacement. This was on a Friday. Two days later, on Sunday, the new e-reader was in my mailbox. Quick service is one thing, Sunday delivery quite another. But that's what the representative specified, and that's what I got. The new reader has new features that set it apart from the old. Chief among these is a very easy-to-use touch screen for changing pages, as well as for a number of other functions. The glare-free screen sets it apart from tablets, providing a high quality of readability, even in direct sunlight. This was true of the old one, too, and was a major reason I chose to go with an option close to what I had before. The touch screen eliminates the old page-change buttons, which means fewer moving parts to break, though that never was a problem with my old one. Over all, I have to say I am delighted both with the product, and with the service. The failure of the first reader was unfortunate, but those things happen from time to time with new products. The level of service after the sale was so good that it removed any negative effects the failure of the first product might have left. The replacement e-reader was in my hands well before Amazon received my returned item back, which shows a high level of concern for providing Amazon customers the best possible service. Well done, and I am greatly enjoying the new e-reader."",""Excellent Product, Even Better Service""";;;;;;

"3.0 out of 5 stars,""I love the paper white e-reader. I got this one for my birthday just a day ago and while the touch-screen is neat I really do not care for it much. I bought the first edition of the kindle with the keyboard and the side buttons to turn pages and it felt as close to reading a book as I could possibly imagine on an electronic device. Your finger could just rest on the button and you 'turn the page', now you have to tap, which that itself isn't a deal breaker, I can handle that, but the device also lost a great feature with the case I had for my old one that snapped right into a cover and had a light that went off the battery of the kindle. Perhaps there is something out there like that, and I hope there is but I was hoping to use the one I had, it was very nice quality. I highly prefer the old version of the kindle, I didn't buy this kindle to play games, or ooh and awe at the 'advanced' technology. All I wanted was a device that would hold my books that I could take anywhere and read whatever I wanted at any time. Instead they try to make this e-reader into some type of tablet.

"3.0 out of 5 stars,""I received my Kindle, 6"""" glare-free, on time. While setting up the Kindle the 'touchscreen' would not let me select not to accept a 30-day free trial of Kindle Unlimited. I had to accept it, then go into myaccount and cancel. Not sure if this was a 'glitch' or a ploy by Amazon. I mainly purchased this Kindle in order to read outside in sunlight (pool, park, etc). My very first time I used the Kindle outside I had a problem with the touchscreen ... I would 'tap' in the area for next page, and 'font size' would pop-up instead. I was no where near tapping the top of the kindle page where you would get change font size menu. I had not had this problem inside. I considered returning the Kindle, but continued to use it. To date the problem has not reoccurred. Hopefully, I haven't screwed myself and down the line it returns. I find the resolution/readability of this kindle as borderline. It is definitely difficult trying to determine which book is which in the library, especially when a book series has pretty much the same cover with a different title. Once a book is selected the reading is acceptable. However, if I had it to do over again I would probably buy the Kindle 6"""" Paperwhite for the resolution and backlighting."",Resolution Borderline Acceptable";;;;;;

"3.0 out of 5 stars,""I wanted something light to use for traveling that can hold my books. I purchased my Kindle from amazon.com and registered it on the US Kindle store.PROS:- light, easy to use, long battery life- screen has no glare and you still need a reading light which I don't mind- it is easy to flip pages with one hand holding the Kindle from either side- the special """"offers' I was worried about, only display on the screen when the Kindle is turned off so it's not as intrusive as I expected. I expected annoying pop-ups so this is definitely better- good value, I got it on sale and you couldn't beat the price for any other e-reader- comes with a built-in 'experimental' browser but it loads very slow and I would not recommend this be used for browsing the internet as a tablet.CONS:- very difficult to browse Kindle store directly from device. Unable to sort titles by price. They are displayed only by popularity, rating and release date. As it is not as responsive as a tablet, having to click on every title to see the price turns browsing for books into a long ordeal. I recommend browsing and buying ebooks on a desktop/laptop- does NOT allow you to purchase books from your US-based Kindle store while abroad! This is very important to those customers that are buying this for travel. You will be forced to change your home country in the settings and will have access ONLY to that country's Kindle store with the prices and product availability on there. Next day you're in a different country, same thing. If you don't download your books ahead of time, you can just pretty much forget it. If this would have been communicated to customers on Amazon, I would have skipped buying the Kindle- inaccurate product description ( see point above)- terrible customer service for any issues you have with Kindle (being told by email to call instead of receiving help over email while you're abroad is not good service)- black and white display only ( if you plan to order magazines through Kindle you will lose a lot of the experience in the black/white colours)."",Cute and light e-reader but not practical for traveling due to download issues with US Kindle store";;;;;;

Well, it turns out you don't even have to swipe the screen to turn the page"; just tapping the screen does the job. Ultimately, the only thing I had to change was the special offers feature. I bought mine with them; and to be fair, they were largely unobtrusive. After a while, however, I opted to pay the $20 fee to unsubscribe from them.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I've had 3 different models of kindles, from one of the earliest with the keyboard and Wifi+3G to the paperwhite with the lit back to this one, and my opinion of them remains unchanged: they are the best thing to happen to people that love reading. And honestly, this is the best model for most people. This is why:🔘  TOUCH SCREEN - nearly everyone is used to touch screens by now, and this kindle is no different. It's easy to turn the pages, but now it is also easy to type notes or search a book, even compared to the older models with a full keyboard since I'm so used to touch typing. And one smaller thing, turning the pages via the touch screen means i don't have to reach to the corner of the device to turn the page as I did with the older model with the edge buttons.🔘  E-INK DISPLAY - look like a real book, seriously. It's only 167 ppi, but that's part of the reason it does! In most of the paperback and hardcover books I've read in the past, the font was always almost a bit grainy, just naturally due to the printing process at the time. And I know this isn't intentional here with the kindle, but that's what it reminds me of, and why it feels like a real book.🔘  NO BACK LIGHT - not a downside to me, since any place I read I would have enough light anyway. I have a lamp at home, planes have individual lights, and my office has plenty of lighting. Studies have even shown that reading in low light does not damage eyes, it only strains them temporarily. And finally, and this is huge if you read before bed, the lack of a back-light means less blue light directly into your eyes to affect your brain's sleep cycle, so you'll fall asleep more readily.🔘  CRAZY BATTERY LIFE - definitely related to the e-ink display and lack of a back-light, the kindle will stay in standby mode FOREVER. Seriously, I charge it once every month or two when I use it sparingly, and when I take it on 1-2 week vacations I never have to charge it. This is honestly the best thing about it, since sure you could use your smartphone/tablet to read books, but both of those will rarely if ever last as long as the kindle, and that's assuming you have them in airplane mode at the lowest brightness. It's nice to have a device that you can pick up always knowing it's got charge.🔘  SLIGHTLY THICKER/HEAVIER - I say this since compared to the older hard buttons entry level model, it's a tiny bit thicker as well as heavier. This is insignificant to me, but it's definitely noticeable. Likely due to the added hardware of a touchscreen display.🔘  WIFI ONLY - Obviously used to sync book, and it works great at that and quickly since books are pretty small in file size. You can even look up your kindle email address in your Amazon account and mail yourself personal PDFs or documents. There's also a web browser in the Kindle though, so you could use this device as a last resort if your smartphone/laptop/tablet are out of battery!🔘  FILE STORAGE - this is actually really nice since you can save files just as if it was a USB flash drive onto the kindle, as well as manually load books from your PC if you have any available.Overall, this is an amazing device and indispensable for those that love reading but don't have space or money for a library. Also great for travelers who like to pack light such as myself!"",Handheld Library w/ Near Infinite Battery Life";;;;;;

This one doesn't have a back light, so it's not going to work well if you read in the dark or low light situations. I can't read in bed without the lamp on."",""Nice size, not the best choice for low light situations.""";;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""This a an excellent little device. I've had it for 2 months and I love it. I have used a Paperwhite and thought it was excellent and would get one of those if I wanted to spend that much, but for the price this represents an excellent value. The design is great and I think it feels higher end. The touch screen is wonderful and the lack of buttons gives it a clean look that I really like. The battery life is likewise amazing and is measured in weeks as opposed to hours or days. I prefer the E-ink display over that of a tablet because it helps with eye fatigue. I always get headaches if I stare at a tablet or computer screen for too long but don't have that issue with the Kindle. In short, if you want something to read books with buy this device, you won't regret it."",Great for reading books";;;;;;
5.0 out of 5 stars,I had a first generation Kindle and broke it this past summer.  I really like the touch screen on this one.  I am enjoying the 30 day free trail of books as well.  My 11 year old daughter really likes the option of  pushing on a word and seeing the definition when reading.  So happy with my purchase.,I really like the touch screen on this one;;;;;;
"4.0 out of 5 stars,""Grabbed this when it hit a low ball price on Amazon and have not been disappointed.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I am tickled pink. I love my Kindle Fire HD 8.9. I really do. BUT (and these are really big buts for me):1. It is heavy to pack in my purse. Like REALLY EXCRUCIATING after an hour.2. It is a battery hog. And that is an  understatement.3. Even with the amoled screen, the glare is piercing to my eyes in bright sunlight.This little reader solves every single complaint I have with my fire. I still will use the fire... At home. And at night the fire beats this.The screen, even under direct light, has no glare. It is like looking at the page of a paper book. Battery life? Wow! And is it lightweight? Uh, YEAH! Furthermore, the touch screen means you can easily read with one hand AND turn the page. What more could I ask for. A light. Yeah, but I have my fire for that.The only drawback I can honestly see is that when delivered, mine had a small smudge. This drives me nuts, so they are replacing it... I think the screen might be kind of fragile, so I am buying a case to protect it."",Ah-mazing";;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I bought the kindle for my son who has dyslexia.  Being able to adjust the font is very helpful for him.  I sent a request to Amazon to consider adding the dyslexia font to the Kindle and you DID!!  This font is really miraculous for people with dyslexia.  My son's reading speed is about twice as fast with this font and his love of reading is multiplied by about a million.  Also, we have 3 more of these kindles for the other readers in the family and we all love it.  I didn't think i could make the transition from paper but I might like the kindle even better.  It's so light in my hand and the appearance of the screen is very similar to paper.  Personally, I wouldn't want one that is back lit since it would be like reading on a tablet, which I think is wearing on the eyes after a while and is stimulating rather than relaxing when reading before bed.  THANK YOU AGAIN AMAZON!"",THANK YOU AMAZON!!!!";;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I ordered the glare-free Kindle basically to use outdoors since my Kindle Fire is very difficult to use outside because of the glare on the screen.  This simple Kindle has exceeded my expectations.  It's very lightweight, making it easy to slip into my purse and take anywhere.  It connects to my other Kindle so I can read from either one and it will know my location in the book.  I would highly suggest it for the person who loves to read outside to enhance the Kindle experience."",Great outdoor reader";;;;;;
"3.0 out of 5 stars,""The ads are annoying and the only way to retrieve the book one is reading is to turn the machine off and then one is able to swipe the ad away.  If this Kindle is for a senior citizen, do not purchase as it is confusing on how to get rid of the ad.  Instead of just leaving the book and able to turn it back on later to where you left off, there are annoying ads to bet rid of.  My mother is 80 years old and cannot figure out how to use the Kindle without my assistance.  In hindsight I should have purchased another Kindle type without ads."",The ads are annoying and the only way to retrieve the book one ...";;;;;;
"4.0 out of 5 stars,""It's been over a year since my Kindle Paperwhite quit on me, and I haven't read a book in that time, even though I love reading. When I saw this for $49 I decided I get it, so that I could hopefully get back into reading instead of spending all my free time online. It came with a month of Kindle Unlimited, but I haven't used it enough yet to comment on it. I've had it a few days, and I've only read one book so far, which really wasn't that good, but this does remind me of how much I've missed having a Kindle.I wish I would have found these when my Grandpa was alive, as he loved old westerns and had a massive collection of books. It was getting darn near impossible to find him a western he hadn't read, and I think this would have helped out a lot.Reading on this is so similar to looking at a piece of paper in a frame it's almost eerie. It still fascinates me and if it wasn't for having to tap an edge to turn the page, and accidentally tapping edges while I'm reading, I'd forget I was on an electronic device.You need light with this one just like you would with a regular book, but I can't say that is a downfall as like I said, it's the same with a regular book.The only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is that sometimes when I'd tap to turn the page it would turn multiple pages and I'd have to start scrolling back to find where I was at.All in all, it's a good product at a good price, and I'm pleased with the purchase."",even though I love reading.

"1.0 out of 5 stars,""I loathe this device. When you don't intend to touch it, it does something. When you do intend to touch it to turn the page or go back or get a definition, it does nothing. Since Amazon is now only offering touch devices, I believe I am done with Kindle readers. As the multiple Kindles that I have die off, I will use my PC and/or my iPad to read Kindle books - that is assuming that Amazon works out the bugs in those apps. Failing that, I guess I will go back to physical books. It was nice while it lasted but Amazon has gotten too far off track for me."",Not good";;;;;;
"4.0 out of 5 stars,""The kindle is a great product";" I really like the touchscreen interface and how easy it is to move back and forth between pages and books.  The organization system is nice and I like having access to the unlimited library for $10/month.  I ended up buying the ad-free after purchase because it really was a little annoying.  I'd recommend getting that right off-the-bat.  My only major complaint is that to turn the Kindle on when it's been off or asleep for more than a few minutes, you have to hold the tiny button on the bottom for a solid 15-20 seconds.  It's kind of annoying but not enough for me to give up the benefits of the touchscreen.  I hope they fix that in the next iteration."",""Touchscreen is great, readability is awesome, ads were annoying, power button is a hassle""";;;;;

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I like to read but since I am retired I have only been able to afford paperbacks.  Since my eyesight is not what it used to be, the contrast and clarity of paperback printing is not consistent and can cause eye strain.  However, the Kindle is a perfect answer to my problem.  The contrast and clarity of the words allow me to read without eyestrain .  Also, kindle books are reasonably priced and I can check out books on line from my local library through Overdrive."",Easy to Read";;;;;;

At least you stuck to the real e-ink on this one,."",I don't like the touch screen";;;;;;
"4.0 out of 5 stars,""I like the Kindle, but I really should have opted for the Paperwhite.On the plus side, I do find the Fonts crisp and clear. and have no problem reading them once a suitable in a size that suits me is decided upon. There is a reasonable selection of Fonts.The slightest movement of my hand, or re-positioning in my chair requires an adjustment of the lamp's position. Also, I have found the screen far too responsive. All too often, not meaning to, I cause the menu's to appear, or the page to turn, when I had no intention of doing so. I also find it rather difficult to discern the titles of books in my library when they are displayed as covers. Very small images, in greyscale are not the best way  to find things. And I have found no way to alter the size of those images. The alternate view of titles is just a list. I tend to recognize not only the title, but the blurbs which remind me why I wanted to read that book. I really wish there was a way to display those covers in larger scale.But all in all, I am glad I finally got my Kindle. Have been reading every day and adjusting to the downsides mentioned."",""Glad, with reservations.""";;;;;;
"3.0 out of 5 stars,""This is not as good as previous versions. I really miss the brightness control, but my main complaint is it is just finicky. If I move it, sometimes it just cuts out and gives me the ads screen and I have to go back in to where I was. Sometimes, it's just not responsive and I have to completely reboot it. I think this would be okay if it wasn't inferior to all the other Kindles I had before. And not just a little bit. This spontaneous cut out is reminiscent of my cellular service where I can't make a phone call from my living room and have to go out on the back deck. If I touch this Kindle wrong, it defaults to the advertising screen."",This is not as good as previous versions";;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I love it . It is easy to set up and fun to read. It lives up to it's non glare screen. Purchasing an e-book  was fun and easy. Did not want to stop reading last night (The first night with the Kindle) it was so comfortable holding it, and of course the story that I was reading was interesting, but mostly it was the novelty of the Kindle, obviously my first one. Anyway the bottom line is that I really do love it and how did I ever live without it for so long. Thank you Amazon for the great sale price, too."",My first love!";;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I'm so pleased I bought this Kindle. For me its hard to convince myself that a Kindle is needed in addition to my laptop, smart phone, and just hard copy books in general. But I've been proven sorely wrong on those objectives. I will stop at work sometimes and read from this Kindle because my eyes start to hurt from looking at my computer screen all day. The special tinted screen is excellent at protecting your eyes, and the tablet is small and lighter than most books! Battery life is long, I have gone months without needing to charge mine due to the device's minimal use of battery.As for the functionality of the Kindle its better than any hard copy book (although it doesn't have the refreshing smell of a new book!). From your home screen you have the option to select a book (you can have more than one book on your kindle at once) you can also search for or select a book ad that amazon offers you on your Kindle (if your Kindle is connected to a wifi) and buy it on your Kindle from your Amazon account. While reading your book you can tap words and get definitions of the words, you can also tap characters in your book and the Kindle will give you a quick background on who the character is and their part in the story. You can highlight parts of your book as well as leave notes in certain places that you can look back at later.You can also buy a book on your laptop or any device that you can use Amazon on and it will upload the book to your Kindle when your Kindle accesses internet. If you want to demo a book to read a sample and see if you like it Amazon will send you a sample for free that you can read on your Kindle as well. If you have Amazon Prime, there are excellent deals on Kindle books as well as a whole library of free books you can read."",""A Worth While Investment!

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""Love this reader. My favorite part is that you can highlight a character and it gives you a description. Would be nice if it were personalized to wherever you were in the book, do it doesn't spoil anything for you, but it's not that bad. Battery life is awesome, too. It kind of sucked finding a case for it, because it's just called kindle not paperwhite or anything. But I found a nice one for like $5  that was universal.

"4.0 out of 5 stars,""This is a great basic reader.  I love the book marking, the dictionary, how easy it is to buy and download books.  It's easy to read.  The ads aren't intrusive.  I've had mine for a week now and I am excited to read again.I took off one star for some annoyances for the way the device responds.  Sometimes if you have a book open, and the screen locks, it doesn't easily unlock.  Other times it doesn't always sense when your finger taps the screen. I'd say this happens about 10% of the time or less.  It's not a deal breaker but it can drive you a little crazy.By the way, it comes with a cable that you can plug into your computer and charge, so you don't need to buy anything extra."",This is a great basic reader";;;;;;
"3.0 out of 5 stars,""As a basic e-reader the latest Kindle does a great job. I have no complaints for what it was meant to do but there is one thing that bothers me and that is the battery life. After only about a week of using it, it seems half my battery is drained after reading through 300 pages.Naturally I was thinking that maybe I've gotten a faulty battery. There was no manual or technical details in the Amazon description to see the battery capacity. I then saw some very small wording on the back of the Kindle itself to see """"input 5.25v max 500mA"""". It hit me, I've been using too high of a current to charge my battery and as a result have deteriorated the battery health. The charger that Amazon suggests to use has a 1A output, or 1000mA.In my opinion, Amazon is pulling some form of planned obsolescence. Not only is 1A the most common output for a usb charger, but it's next to impossible to find one with a """"slower"""" charge. I'm going to end up charging my Kindle from my computer whenever I'm already on it from now on in efforts to keep the longevity of the battery. (Computer usb 2.0 ports output a maximum of 500mA)"",Less battery life than I thought";;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""If you want to read books on something cheap, but have access to hundreds and hundreds of books you like, and not have to carry the physical book, this is a great thing to have. Only issue I had was you must have a light source if you want to read at night. I knew that when I bought it, so it is not the Kindle or Amazon's fault. That one is on me.

Other than that it is ok for what it does. Clear text, lightweight, good size.  It has a nice feature where you or anyone you pre-allow can email you documents to read. But not PDF... I'm just rating it down 1 for the ads and not using all common formats."",""Works well, easy to read, no epub or PDF""";;;;;;
1.0 out of 5 stars,This is without doubt the worst kindle I have ever used.It has touch screen controls that are frustrating to use.  Constantly distracting the reader with unintentional changes caused by the slightest whisper of contact.  Even contact with the frame alone will sometimes result in unintentional activation of some of the features (e.g. change font size) on this reader.  Then often requires repeated contacts to activate a wanted feature (e.g. change font size).Perhaps someway to program and lock in some features like font size would make this more user friendly.  Why does Amazon would sell such a product?Perhaps they need some of us to go back to paper - I know I look for real books much more frequently now!Steve,Promotes reading books printed on paper!;;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I am new to these e-readers. Just bought a Kindle reader. I love it. It's small enough to carry in a purse even with my nice padded case. Of course, I love being able to download and store a lot of books. But, I,also, love being able to change the font and print. There is the ability to book mark  a page and change the margin. I haven't tried reading in the bright outdoors, yet, because it's winter here. But, I love to read on my porch during the summer. So, the glare free feature will be nice. At first, I regretted not having a built in light, but reading in the dark with a light is not good for the eyes. However, that feature might be handy if I am traveling on a plane when I don't want to disturb those around me. In a case like that, I'll just have to get a book light.I purchased a nice padded case that has a sleeper feature that helps me save my place. One tap of the lock screen, and I'm where I left off. That's right. One tap or swipe turns the page. Lastly, the price was affordable. I have a new iPhone, a new tablet, and now my new e-reader. Of the three, this reader is my favorite electronic device."",Love this device";;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""This is my third Kindle and I have liked all of them, but I LOVE this one. My daughter convinced me to get this one and I am glad she did. I have RA so books can be hard for me to hold. That is one reason I love Kindles. I love how lightweight this one is. I love that if I don't know a word I can just look it up on the kindle. Before I had to make a list to look up on the computer later and that was a pain. I love the screen and how easy it is to use. I love that I am not constantly hitting buttons on it. Weather it is the page buttons or the keyboard or whatever button got in my way at the time. The one complaint I have is that there is not a case with a light available for it. So if books are hard for you to hold and you understand technology well enough then I highly recommend this kindle for you!

No one to talk to, no basic instructions anywhere and I was about to just get rid of it.  Finally was able to get it working but the manual was of little help to me because I needed basic steps to even get started.  Your Customer Service online helped somewhat but still left holes on what I needed to actually use the Kindle.  Finally found your videos and they were helpful but when I went back to gather further info, the videos were no where to be found.

"2.0 out of 5 stars,""I got this as a gift b/c I won it from a school raffle.  At first it seems great.. but the wifi on it is extremely slow and most of the time it's not even working.  If you want to do something simple on the experiemental browser like checking your email or going on to amazon... don't even think it will always work, because it crashes most of the times and EXTREMELY SLOOOWWWWw.  To send your document files over transferring to PDF the sizes and format is all bonkers after it converts for you.  However, if you save your DoCx as a PDF file and then send it to the kindle, it's viewable, just very very small fonts versus the DOCx extreme crazy huge fonts LOL.  Even then, the kindle decides when it wants to save the file and when it will not.. for instance sometimes I send the file over to the device... and keep pressing the sync button to update and show the file?? It doesnt work.. keeps saying """"NO NEW FILES"""" wth?? SO you wait like maybe when it's in a good mood then it will download the file.  NOT SURE IF I GOT A LEMON but this was a brand new kindle out of the box.  They purchased at full cost.  Other than that, their promotion features of this kindle having the easy navigation to skip pages DOES NOT WORK with every file or every book.  Some of them does not allow you to use that feature sadly.  All in all it was quite a disappointment to think I could use this to study my notes instead of printing out notes to save trees and cost.

"2.0 out of 5 stars,""I have the original Kindle Keyboard and love reading on it but dislike how cumbersome it is to navigate or type using the keyboard and buttons. The screen is also so yellow that it can be hard to read (I'm 50, if that helps). When I saw the ad for this new Kindle (7th gen) it said the font was darker and the pictures of it show a whiter screen. I was thrilled that it had a touchscreen as well.Well the screen is actually MORE yellow than my original Kindle Keyboard! Also, the font used on the Home page list of books is so fine and pale that it's really hard to read (and you can't change it). The Keyboard's Home list is dark and clear. Highlighted sentences are REALLY hard to read, unlike the Keyboard. I was so disappointed to see all this and am puzzled as to why Amazon would take a giant step backwards in the non-touchscreen aspects.I also don't like how slippery it is to hold. I like to use my Kindle """"naked"""" since it keeps it lightweight. The original Keyboard had a slightly rubberized back. (It also looked a lot nicer, but that alone wouldn't turn me off the new one.)I only paid $50 for mine on a Black Friday special, but it's going back. It's not worth buying a new Kindle just to have a touchscreen. It sounds like the PaperWhite is probably a better match for me if it truly has a whiter screen, but $119 is way too much for me."",Disappointing.";;;;;;

When my kindle-keyboard screen cracked, I went without for a while, but decided I missed having my library with me and looked at all the (numerous) versions of kindle out now.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I really never saw myself as wanting one of these type devices.  I've always been a hard-core 'real' book person.  However, after reviewing this particular device, and catching it on sale ($59) I decided to take the plunge.  I love this reader!  It is very simple and straightforward: easy to navigate.  I've not purchased any books yet, but did 'borrow' a few from my public library.  Transfer rate was very quick. Amazon is the middle man on this, so you do need an Amazon account to borrow books.Some of the reviews I read mentioned that they did not like the touch screen vs. older versions having buttons.  Personally, I like the touch screen.  The other issue folks talked about was the device not having a back light"; again I don't see any problems with this.This unit features 8 different font sizes, 6 different fonts and 3 different display settings for line spacing and margins, respectively.  I did some tweaking to suite my personal tastes and have been very happy with the way I can 'read'.  The size is just about right to be held with one hand.  The screen is easy to read, once you get it adjusted to your liking.  The battery, I can't really comment on yet.  I've charged it fully, but not sure of how long it will last.  The only thing I was surprised about was the fact that you cannot completely turn the unit off.  When you hit the power button on the bottom of the unit, you are given 3 options: cancel, restart and screen off.  I have been using the screen off option.  The unit has a nice feature involving a dictionary.  If you touch/highlight a word, you will get a display screen from the on board dictionary;" complete with definition of the word.  There are also links for Wikipedia and Goodreads, to name a few.  For these you need to be connected to Wi-Fi.  This wasn't very  intuitive.  There is a mode called 'airplane mode' in the settings.  When you are in 'airplane mode', the wi-fi is disconnected.  To connect, simply take the airplane mode, off.As with any device, you have to take in to consideration what you want to device to do for you.  For me, I chose this, not only for the good reviews, but because I was only looking for a device to use for reading books, not surfing, emailing ,etc.  This is why I chose this and not a tablet.The only additional purchases I needed to make, an have done so, were for a case and a power adapter.  This unit comes with a USB charging cable, but I prefer to use a regular wall power adapter.  I found one marked down at Walmart for $10.

"3.0 out of 5 stars,""My kids showed some interest at first, but now they are not using it. I think it's because it lacks backlights (so you cannot read it in the car or some dark places) and sometimes its screen flickers (one per every 6 touches). Now I realized that the backlight at least is an option that you definitely pay some money to."",""My kids showed some interest at first, but now ...""";;;;;;
"4.0 out of 5 stars,""Features: Its awesome being able to select words and have them defined. And amazing that you can select a characters name and it will tell you who that character is. This helps me a lot when I get names mixed up. Its also nice being able to adjust font type and size and see where you are in the book and how long you have left to read.Touch screen: Works great, better then expected. Typing is no problem. It is some times annoying when you turn a page not intending to though. This can happen easily sense this touch screen seems to respond to any pressure, not just finger tips. So anything that touches the screen and pushes down on it will turn the page. I knocked a star off my ratting because this can be really annoying.Battery life: Incredible, I have not charged it sense I got it, and its been 10 days. (I read every day for hours.)Ergonomics: Looks good and feels good. Its possible to do page turns with 1 hand, and I do it, but its not ideal. Normally you have to use your other hand to touch the screen to turn the page. But this hasn't been a problem. And I feel reading is much faster with this. With a real book, I find my self turning over in bed to read the left page, then turning over to read the right page. But with this Kindle I can lay any way I want, and read with out adjusting. Also with a real book, sometimes your arms gets tired, but this thing is so light its not a problem.Glare: I have only had issues with screen glare twice, and both times it was indoors. But for the most part the anti glare screen works great even outside in the sun.Book marks: Its easy to book mark a page, and you can book mark as many spots as you want and jump to them at anytime.Getting books: Its actually harder then I thought, particularly when it comes to sharing books. Maybe I am just still learning? But nothing was as straightforward as I had hoped. I had to have my friend who owns a kindle walk me through how to get a book she shared with me, and I had to do it all on my computer on amazon. I wish when someone shared a book with me it would just pop up on my kindle saying """"so and so share this book with you, accept?"""" Wouldn't that be so much easier?"",Pretty good";;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I love this device! When they first came out I was against them. Only recently after watching some videos by others did my interest get peeked enough to write out a pro/con list. The E-Reader won by a lot. Yes, the regular book is very special and unique, a classic always, but the e-reader makes it more efficient and user friendly. The device is very light weight and easy to hold compared to regular paperbacks and hard covers. Two of the best qualities for this device is 1) it can hold several thousands books. No more bulk carrying or having a hard time deciding which book to bring with you out of the house, you bring them all! 2) the built-in dictionary and online wifi ability to search further on words, terms and phrases! Pricing for e-books tied for pro and con as some books can be very cheap while others either the same or more expensive than the actual book. But the other pros outweighs this cons. In the end you will save money throughout buying your collection. You will also never have to buy an addition copy due to losing the book, giving it away or damage that can be very easy. One book I had bought 4 times due to poor binding style. But now I will never have to buy again! I'd highly recommend the E-Reader to anyone. It doesn't mean you will never buy or read a regular book. I still own books, but mostly all my fiction and smaller novels are on e-book format while picture books and larger history, study or research books I buy in regular format."",Best Alternative Device for Books!";;;;;;
"4.0 out of 5 stars,""Fired this up for the first time. It charged quickly. I haven't had a chance to rate the battery life yet. Don't bother with the $20 USB charging adapter. I used the standard 5 V one that came with my Android phone and it worked perfectly with the USB charging cable that comes with this Kindle. The screen feels different in texture from my first generation Kindle Fire, more texture, less glossy. I do like the E-Ink although the way the text dissolves when I turn a page takes a little getting used to. Not a deal breaker. Books download off WiFi just as fast as they do on my Kindle Fire, so no noticeable difference there. I like how light the unit is. Was pleasantly surprised at the """"Experimental Browser"""" under settings. I was able to read articles from the BBC and check my FB page. It is a slow browser and of course everything is in black and white or gray scale. However it will allow me to check my email, top news and social media in the remote small towns of the Maritime's as long as I can find the local public WiFi spot. Since I expected only an e-reader that was a pleasant added value. I left off one star because I think it is switch and bait marketing on the part of Amazon to offer a Kindle at a good sale price and then not ship it with a part needed to charge it that happens to cost as much as the savings from the sale price."",Mostly Impressed";;;;;;
"2.0 out of 5 stars,""Reading on a Kindle has become a tolerable experience. Pages flip with relative ease and there is a minimum of page refresh distraction. Unfortunately, absolutely everything else about the experience ranges from annoying to impossible.On the hardware side, the capacitative touch screen is insensitive and imprecise. Attempting to highlight text, for example, is a fiddly affair, with the position of the cursors, especially the endpoint, often seemingly placed at random. Adjusting the cursors to the desired start and end points can be difficult, even impossible. Every action seems to move at a snail's pace"; my original iPad, almost five years old now, is a speed demon in comparison. WiFi connectivity is slow, cantankerous, and sometimes unreliable, regardless of the actual signal strength.The software is a mess, full stop. It is slow, ugly, and violates just about every usability protocol. For example, important functions are often nested several layers deep. Because the menus are context sensitive, a desired function may require several extra steps to access as it is only available in certain contexts; the exact opposite effect context aware menus are supposed to have. The software keyboard is particularly slow and unresponsive, and its spelling suggestions can be bizarre. Forget a passcode or parental control password? You have to reset the entire device, which includes reregistering the device (including reentering your Amazon password);" going through the """"How To"""" guide, a step which cannot be skipped"; and re-adding all of your content manually.Amazon FreeTime Unlimited, which I subscribed to for my daughter, is, perhaps, even less well laid out than the full Kindle experience. Further, the books included are rarely of any quality, skewing towards product tie ins and low-rent graphic novels. Adding books from my full adult library, which should be easy, requires entering the parental password twice, for no reason whatsoever; after all, the user has already entered the password to edit a FreeTime profile;" why should it be entered again to add books?In conclusion, I don't expect this review to change anyone's mind, least of all Amazon's. After all, Kindles keep selling, and Amazon's selection of available content is nigh unbeatable. If all you want to do is carry around a library and read, it's tolerable. For any other purpose, the headaches and frustration mount. I couldn't, for example, imagine using a Kindle for school, where functions like highlighting and note taking become more important. Perhaps by the 15th or 20th generation, the usability and responsiveness will rival a first gen iPad or, for that matter, my long departed Handspring PDA. One can always hope."",Unbelievably clunky hardware and software"
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""Love it, love it, love it!!!!  I'm enjoying my new Kindle very much.

"4.0 out of 5 stars,""Item came quickly with AMAZON PRIME made for it Citron covered which I will review separately. Just opened it. Set up was a breeze, five minutes. I did expect and hope the screen would be a bit brighter than my old gray screen NOOK, but I knew it didn't have back lighting. I'm new to readers having only had the one other fore mentioned. This item is small and light weight, just what I wanted. I can drop it n my purse or carryall and never be bored again on buses, breaks, appointments. I was disappointed that books I have previously bought on Amazon did not pop up immediately, though books on my wish list did. That tells you that they were intentionally held back. Guess like a previous reviewer said I'll have to pay $2.99 each?  If so, that's trifling of Amazon. (Similar to having pay for some of the older AMAZON movies on PRIME to be streamed to your TV. Thought I could save and not get NETFLIX.)I did not order the bllack cover with my order. I checked first to see if they had any of the colors left that were advertised with the item. Don't know why they offered only black with check out. I waited to order the cover afterward after being sufficiently convinced it was the same one for protection of the device. I took a chance and did not buy the protection plan. Love the $59 dollar price";" glad I didn't shell out the $79 price last month.During set up, AMAZON Introduces you to a number of features of your new device which I found helpful, such as highlighting, notes, dictionary.Battery was half full which helped with set up. Also mostly everyone has a power adapter around so don't waste your money ordering the extra $14.99 cord.This KINDLE is strictly for reading, black and white. A reader verses a book is better if you need to adjust the print size. Why strain your eyes?Also the lighted background issue can be solved with a light made for readers. GLAD I saved my old NOOK LIGHT.  But if you're reading in bright light you won't need it.I was back and forth - NOOK or KINDLE. As far as I know the NOOK does not have a screen password. So if you accidently lay it on the table and walk away, anyone can just pick it up and so to speak leaf through. I WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED to find a screen lock on the KINDLE, just numbers so you don't have to remember a long, complicated password.Sorry this is such a jumble, just trying to post this right away. Overall, I am glad I purchased this although I don't see much difference between it and my old SIMPLE NOOK, except for the password protection, which by the way still works fine. But I buy most of my books on Amazon and had trouble getting them on NOOK.  (I get my Barnes &Noble books on my IPAD KINDLE APP, but so far not on my device, as well as some books I bought on Amazon. Maybe I'm doing something wrong.) My iPad is too big to carry around comfortably, and too much of a magnet on the bus. I checked out the iPad mini which I plan to also get which no matter the size of the iPad allows for reading of all media no matter the source and color. But this little, light- weight KINDLE no glare has its own advantages, carry to the beach or park, throw in purse, perfect for every day convenience. I'm sure when I discover some of the other features, I'll grow to love it even more."",""Quick, easy set up, light weight, convenient...""";;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I have been tempted to get this newer kindle for a while but I could never convince myself to pull the trigger because I already own a Kindle Keyboard which I've had and loved for years. The Prime Day sale finally got me to buy the upgrade and I'm glad I did. It has a noticeably higher resolution screen than the keyboard model which makes the screen easier to look at for long periods of time. It also feels much lighter weight to me, which makes it easier to read in bed when I'm holding the Kindle at sometimes unusual angles. The battery has also been stellar so far, as I haven't needed to charge it after the first charge out of the box and it's been the better part of a month (with relatively light use). It's still sitting comfortably at around 50% battery.If I had to make a complaint, it's that it no longer has the page turning buttons that came on my Kindle Keyboard. It's not exactly hard to just tap the screen (which is surprisingly fingerprint resistant) but this means you have to turn the page with your right hand, because the left side of the screen goes back a page rather than forward. I also realize you get these buttons with the Voyage (along with a higher resolution lit screen) but for the amount that I read, I couldn't justify the large additional cost.All things considered, I am very happy with the new Kindle and I feel the upgrade from my Kindle Keyboard is significant enough to justify the cost."",A Nice Upgrade From My Kindle Keyboard";;;;;;
4.0 out of 5 stars,I got this for my fiance she loves it it actually looks like real paper this is a great product The battery has lasted for a week and a half so far and that is constant use however I did not like that all my information was already on it including my credit card information if I was going to give this as a gift to someone they would have all my information so if you buy this as a gift Open it yourself and take that information out,Great product top-of-the-line very happy;;;;;;
"3.0 out of 5 stars,""Would like this better if I hadn't owned the previous version. the touch screen doesn't add much for the functionality, and I liked the side buttons better. thinker and heavier, but not bad. not having controls on the bottom makes the screen look smaller and off center, but that is just esthetic."",Miss my old kindle";;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""so my kindle 3 finally crapped out on me. It was a sad day since that thing had been handed down to me and gone through a lot. It survived drops, spills, a busted (and twice repaired) USB port, lost buttons, and exposure to the elements. In other words, it was a true workhorse. Unfortunately, one last drop was its untimely end and the screen finally succumbed to the abuse it had handled for 2 and half years.I was a little weary about purchasing a new ebook reader, as I prefer real, concrete pages over electronic data, but I had a lot of good memories with the past kindle and the thing served me well. When Amazon ran a Valentine's Day special for the newest generation at a measly 60 bucks, I couldn't resist.It's true I've had the device for less than 2 weeks, and it's true maybe its quirks will come out later, but I don't see that happening. The kindle 7 is a piece of technological art. It's not pretty in that sense, but it's a work of art in what it does and offers.I mean, it'll hold thousands of books! And the battery will last hundreds of hours! I've used my continuously for a week and the battery is still more than half full. Not only that, but it's touch screen, has wifi and is just the right size. And speaking of right size, the options for text size range from the very minuscule (my favorite) to the ginormous (perfect for when I try to read at the gym). It's super light, intuitive, and insanely easy to use.Yeah, it doesn't have a light. And yeah, it's boring black and white, but you know what? Who cares? It's for books! Books don't have lights. And unless it's a children's book, a coffee table time, or a collectors edition, the novel you just paid 10 dollars for is heavier, takes up more space, and most assuredly isn't in color.Seriously though, this kindle is awesome and I haven't been happier with a technological device since my iPhone 6. Sure, I predict I'll be getting an iPad in the future, but until then, the kindle 7 is my e-reader of choice and worth every penny!"",Worth every penny.";;;;;;

"1.0 out of 5 stars,""My kindle died at one year, 3 months  it was replaced.  One year and three months later the same exact thing happened to the new kindle.  Both times, it refused to charge .

So figure that you will get two years usage out of a Kindle it is a disposable product.  They won't tell you that but if you google the kindle you will find that everyone knows it.

"4.0 out of 5 stars,""I loved my Kindle Keyboard, but it just died (I have a feeling my two-year-old stepped on the screen), so I needed a replacement.This is the option I went with, and I am very happy with my choice.Before purchasing, I was worried about the touch-screen – I thought the screen would get dirty from constant touching, and that it wouldn't be very responsive compare to hard buttons. Neither of these concerns is an issue: the screen stays clean and the touch-screen is VERY responsive – almost shockingly so. I would venture to say it's the most responsive touch-screen I've ever used, on any kind of device. The page-turn time is also shorter, so this device feels fast.I will say that it feels quite a bit cheaper than my previous Kindle. There is no longer the non-slip material on the back (which I miss), now it's all the same hard plastic. It also feels sort of """"hollow"""" and flimsy compared to the solid heft of the Kindle Keyboard. It's also kind of boxy. Still feels nice in the hand overall, though, and it's a pleasure to use.Finally (and this is purely based on my memory), I think that the contrast on this might be slightly less than my previous Kindle. But it's close, and certainly isn't an issue.The """"special offers"""" are not intrusive at all. Some of them actually are useful (e.g., books I may be interested in, useful accessories, etc.) I wouldn't shy away from saving some money and """"putting up"""" with the offers.Overall, a very nice Kindle for the money.

"4.0 out of 5 stars,""I've been on something of a minimalist kick as of late, envious of those adhering to the 100 (or sometimes even less) things challenge to eliminate clutter, live more simply, avoid retail therapy, etc. The Kindle has been more or less on my radar since it came out, but around christmas time last year, a special promo sale on this, the most basic model, finally caused me to pull the trigger. For the cost of a few books (or to be fair, the cost of the last technical book I bought), I thought this was a very smart buy. Not only did I have a number of PDFs and Kindle books I had already bought, but I wouldn't worry about my """"things count"""" or clutter level when continuing to buy books.This reader is the most stripped down of the Kindle line, possibly ever, though it does include a touch screen. The form factor is good, it's the weight and dimensions it should be. The display is good. I'm surprised when I'm asked about eInk type displays. Many more people than I would have guessed do not realize the difference between a screen like this and phone/ipad display. Amazon probably doesn't help this matter by selling both backlit and Android-derived tablets also under the Kindle name. The screen is worlds easier on your eyes than the laptop/tablet/TV LCDs we're all so used to. The text can obviously be adjusted to where you like it. This must be a godsend for people who would ordinarily seek out large-print books, which are special orders and obviously not available for every book.The touch screen functionality, however, is not that great. It's just not what we're used to, which to be fair, is on much more expensive devices like the iPad. While it works, especially for opening books, changing pages, and such, it's tedious if you try and use it on the browser, for example, the way you might on a tablet. Although it's not perfect, I'd probably rather have this over a physical keyboard a la the early generation Kindles.On that note, the Kindle includes an experimental browser (I think it's quite literally called the Experimental Browser even- which is a good way to manage the expectations of anyone using this feature!). It's an utterly charming way to surf the Internet. If you ever wondered what the web would be like on a compact, b/w Mac from 1991, here it is. For me, it tends to crash a lot as well, but when it's working properly it's pretty cool. Seems to have a good amount of trouble connecting to public wi-fi that sends you to a portal page. I haven't looked into Kindle-friendly web sites yet, but I remain intrigued by this feature and glad it's there.The battery life is excellent. One of the best features for this in a world where noone's anything is ever charged. The """"features"""" this particular model lacks only serve to prolong battery life. I also appreciate that when connected to a computer, this shows up as a drive, and files can be dragged and dropped (store purchases just show up when the Kindle is on wi-fi and purchases are directed to send them there). A wise choice considering how frustrating Apple is with regards to the way iTunes is required to manage those devices.All in all, I am really happy with this product."",I thought this was a very smart buy.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""Amazing! I love the kindle the new design is wonderful for children too. It's about the width of a standard pencil, and weighing only 6 ounces, there are no bulky books to carry! As with all Kindles the Kindle 6 is a dedicated e-reader, meaning children will stay focused without the distractions of a computer or internet. Which I think is a great Idea, also most notably, you can comfortably read the Paperwhite in bright sunlight without any glare, which is one of the biggest advantages to using an eBook reader compared to a iPhone. also I love that the amazon book store has there books so cheap like .99-5.99 for some books!, The screen is front lit ,LED lights along the edge of the display shine down onto the digital page not from the back of the screen like many other eBook readers and tablets do.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I bought this to supplement using my iPad Mini as a Kindle. I had resisted buying a Kindle over the years, since I had been using my iPhone and iPad to read my Kindle library. I enjoyed the fact that I could read in the dark and ignored the fact that the sun created blinding glare. To me, the trade off was worth it, though. I liked the fact that I only needed one electronic device when I was on an airplane.To me, it was the best of both worlds.Recently, I needed to rethink my stance on a Kindle, though. A situation came up that required me to leave my iPad and iPhone behind. So, I ordered a Kindle. Fortunately, I ordered it when they went on sale for Christmas, so I only paid $59 for it. What a bargain.Since I received it, I have been extremely happy. Syncing it to both my home WiFi and Kindle account was easy. Downloads are lightning fast. This is probably because all it does is show books, no email or anything else to slow it down. Reading on it has been a breeze- you can customize both the font and font size. Navigation happens by touching one of the edges of the screen. There is a built in dictionary for words I am not familiar with. Overall, this is the perfect gadget for reading. In addition, the black and white rendering of pictures in the books is excellent.The Kindle is very light, so it is easy to hold for extended periods of time. It is similar to (not the same as) the new paperback book size, so it is easy to handle. There is also the added benefit of it not closing in the middle of a paragraph. It synced right up to everything else, so I didn't loose my place in any of the books I was reading.There is a built in web browser. I played with it for about 2 minutes and have never looked at it again. It was slow and the graphics are lacking. This one doesn't play music, take notes, have a voice recorder, or anything like that. There is no built in light, despite the background being pretty white. This is the bare bones model.If you want an e-reader, this is the model I would recommend. If you want a way to browse the web and watch movies, as well as read a book, take a look at a Samsung or an Apple tablet.  This is the one duplicated electronic gadget that I wont mind taking with me on a trip. It is so light, that I'll hardly notice it is there."",Perfect e-reader";;;;;;

The touch screen is nice and my daughter and I are having fun with the word wise and the dictionary. It is also nice that it holds your spot, I can jump around to different books and not have to worry about what page I was on. I love that it is just an eReader and that you can't go on any social media with it, it helps you read more by being less distracted by different apps. I also didn't want my daughter having access to the internet I just wanted it to help give her more of a love for reading, not something with games and apps. We are so in love with our kindles it does everything it claims. We took them out side and had no glare, worked perfect!

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I've been debating about getting a Kindle for a long time and finally took advantage of the sale around Mother's Day.  I am thrilled with this product!

I didn't know if I wanted the Paperwhite with the buttons and the built in light but the review was so helpful that I chose this one and am not sorry I did.

The prices for reading materials are so much less and I am still learning about getting books from the library, etc.  It's so easy to use and I haven't had any problems tapping the screen to turn pages, etc.  It's a simple device to use and great to take along when I have appointments or just want to read.  I love that it is lightweight.  I only wanted mine for reading purposes and didn't want all the """"bells and whistles.""""  I have nothing negative to say about this great device.  I wish I'd gotten one sooner but I did save money on the sale!  If you're debating about getting one for reading books, I highly recommend this one.

I found that so helpful"",Sometimes my eyes are sensitive to the light in the computer and was concerned about that so I thought I can just as easily use";;;;;;
"3.0 out of 5 stars,""There's two ways to review this:  as a stand-alone product or comparison to a Nook e-ink reader of the same size.  I'll mainly focus on the comparison:Good:  Syncs easily with Amazon and Prime features open up free options.  The background on the Kindle is slightly lighter than on the nook.  That offers more contrast but really is a matter of personal taste whether you would consider that a good or bad thing.  I've read for hours straight on both and suffer no more or less eye strain on either.  Charging the Kindle is easier and more universal than the Nook.  The Nook requires nook specific charger and even micro usb cable to work properly while the Kindle seems to work regardless of cable or plugging into a number charger types.Less than Optimal:  I have yet to find a battery percentage on the Kindle.  The Nook has the icon and an easy way to get to a screen that shows what percent of the battery life remains.  That little icon on the Kindle doesn't offer enough information to know whether you have 30 or 5% left.Page numbers.  The Nook automatically calculates how many pages your book has based on the font and size you choose and then gives you a display saying page x of y.  The Kindle gives you different options, including page #, but it doesn't give you page x of y.  It'll give you page number and x% complete.  Which again, lacks specificity like the battery meter.  The Nook has a touchscreen like the kindle for page turning but also has 4 buttons that can be configured for one handed reading and page turning without have to touch the screen.  I typically read with the item resting in my left hand, which means to turn the page on the kindle I have to bring my right hand up and either swipe or touch the right side of the screen.  With the Nook, I can set the lower left button, which i can reach with my left thumb, to turn the page forward so my right hand can hold my drink or shoveling chex mix in without worrying about dripping, spilling, or getting the e-reader grubby.Similar:  Screen size, case size, although the Kindle """"feels"""" lighter.  I don't have a scale for these light weights and i haven't checked the specs on both to compare but it does feel lighter.  The Nook on the other hand has more of a rounded back which gives it a softer feel.  Again, that is personal preference on whether you would consider that a good or bad option.  In either case, I don't have big hands and they both rest comfortably for long periods of time.The Kindle is a solid performer but if comparing to the Nook, I'd give the Nook a slight edge in the area of form and function.  When it comes to searching for books, the next in the series, and some other software type areas the Kindle wins especially with Prime."",Comparison";;;;;;

"3.0 out of 5 stars,""The screen is great, and it works quickly, but it is not as functional as Amazon's earlier Kindle Touch. Some of it is just a greater familiarity with their older version, but a lot of it is a loss of functionality. For example, it has no audio capability, now takes a couple of different menus to shut off wi-fi and an extra swipe to actually turn-on the device, which I dislike. It is a nice, basic e-reader, which is what I wanted, but it is a shame that Kindle actually seems to be moving backwards in terms of their device capabilities and design."",Not as functional";;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I just got this in the last week, but so far I'm in love with it.  It's easy to read on, the letters are very crisp and its easy to turn pages. I don't have very large hands and it's the perfect size, kind of like an actual book, but thinner! I like that I can buy books straight from the kindle, and don't have to go and plug it into my laptop to sync.  It fits easily in my purse or bag and seems pretty sturdy.  I waited a really long time to get an e-reader because I just really like reading on paper better. I'm glad I waited because this version is really great. I still kind of get the feeling of reading on paper, and my eyes don't get tired like they do on my iPad or others.

5.0 out of 5 stars,Just got my Kindle today and it is perfect!  It came with all my account info already set and all I had to do was download my books and sign into my Goodreads account.  It is a much better reading experience than my phone and the screen is easy on the eyes.  It charged quickly and the touch screen responds well.  I was very glad I got the version without offers as the screen is too small to find ads not bothersome.  It was certainly worth the $20 to not have to see any ads from the moment I opened the box.,Solid Buy;;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I purchased this Kindle to read books. It does just that. It doesn't have any other features.I own a tablet that I use for the other functions. I wanted an inexpensive and convenient way to carry a large number of books with me. This fits the bill!  It is light weight and a perfect size that I can slip into my purse and take it everywhere.  Also if I accidentally leave it somewhere I'm not out 100's of dollars like my tablet.This Kindle is perfect for reading outside when we are camping. I struggle to see my tablet in the sun.  This Kindle is not lit so you can't read in the dark. I don't tend to read in the dark, so it is not an issue for me.It all depends on what you want to use it for. If you want a way to just purchase and read books, this is the Kindle for you. If you want to surf the internet or read email, look at another model.The last Kindle I owned was one of the originals and didn't have a touch screen. You had to change pages by pressing a button. This is leaps and bounds beyond!Love it!"",Love it!!";;;;;;
"4.0 out of 5 stars,""I thought I'd never stop reading paper books.  I love the feel of turning the page, and the smell of the paper (the older, the better).  But I read a Kindle-only book on my mom's Kindle HD, and finished reading it on my husband's Kindle e-reader, and I was hooked.  The display is very easy on the eyes, and much better than reading on a phone screen.  It's incredibly portable, and is easy to store on my bedside.  I read a LOT more now than I used to.The touchscreen is sort of annoying sometimes though.  It's hard to """"turn"""" the pages with one hand, and if I set it down face-down for a second, then there are several inadvertent page-turns and other adjustments when I pick it back up.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I'm a life-long avid reader and waited so long to get a Kindle because I didn't think I'd like it. Was I wrong! I used to drag a paperback around everywhere (2 or 3 if I was traveling) & was lost if I finished it before getting home to the stacks of books waiting to be read. But I had not been reading for fun in a couple years and stopped carrying a book with me due to business demands and I've really missed it. Now, this just lives in my purse & I can grab a page or two or a chapter whenever I'm stuck in line or a waiting room or out to eat alone. Turn it on & I'm back into the world of the book at the place I left it. I love it! I'm back home!I've had this for about 6 months and have only had to charge it about once a month. My only regret is that I did not get the Paperwhite so I could read it in darker rooms easier without having to turn lights on or use a booklight. I think that will be my next gift to me. I know I won't be without a Kindle again."",I didn't think I'd like it. Was I wrong!";;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""This is my very first kindle. I was really not sure what to expect when I ordered it. I had always just read books but I saw how much cheaper e books are and thought I would try it out. I did a lot of research trying to find the Kindle that would be best for me, I don't need a back light or buttons that turn the page when pressed. So this very basic model was perfect for me. I am very happy with my purchase and at only $79 this is a steal."",My First Kindle";;;;;;
"3.0 out of 5 stars,""Replaced my original Kindle, which I thought was great. This one not so much. The touch screen is too sensitive. Close the protective cover and the page changes. If I dropped something on the screen, I have to shut the kindle off in order to clean the screen. Don't know how, but the kindle regularly changes the font size, sometimes larger, sometimes smaller. It was much more convenient to have the forward and back page on both sides of the page. Its difficult using my left hand to advance the page. Original software allowed me to organize my books, for me, my wife, what's next to read, what's already been read, etc. Although the new software has 'collections', books are in multiple places. Amazon took a simple, useful product and added too many features. Just because you can, doesn't mean you should."",Not as good as the original";;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""This is a great basic reader. It has no bells and whistles, it is not in color, and you can't play games or watch movies on it, which is just what I want.

It's no glare screen is so nice compared to my iPad which I had been using to read. I can read it at the beach, on the bus, in front of a bright window, really anywhere. There is no back-light, but a simple reading light can help with that. I highly recommend this reader to anyone who wants a good, basic reader."",Great basic reader";;;;;;

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""First off, I bought this at a great price ($49) during the 2014 Holiday Season Deals. I am very happy with this purchase. I have to admit, I haven't read many books in the past. I didn't seem to have the time or want to sit and read a clunky book. I normally get my reading fix from the internet or articles from a newspaper. Since I bought the Kindle, I've found myself reading more and wanting to read more books!The Kindle is light weight and simple to navigate. At a little over six and a half ounces, the Kindle is easy to hold with one hand and when I'm done, it disappears into my cargo pocket. The touchscreen is very responsive and after about five minutes, I knew all I needed to know about navigation and settings. Setting up the Wi-Fi was a breeze even with password protection. Downloading books and pictures were fast and simple, even while using my horribly slow satellite internet service. As for the Special Offers included with my Kindle, I thought that when I bought it I'd be seeing adverts popping up everywhere. The only times I've seen an advert was while it was in stand-by mode, so I don't have a problem with Amazon showing me a few random things from time to time.Another great thing about the Kindle is the battery life. I've only had to charge it once since I bought it and that was 27 days ago!!! That being said, I turn off the Wi-Fi when I'm not downloading books or syncing. I also only read about an hour or two a day, so results may vary for some buyers. Really the only thing I could wish for the Kindle is a Micro-SD slot. I know that it has Cloud storage, but I really would like to have multiple SD-cards for multiple genre categories. It would be nice for my personal preferences. All in all, this Kindle is great and I've recommended it to a dozen people so far. I'm very happy with my purchase and I will continue to use my Kindle for as long as it lasts!"",Perfect for my needs";;;;;;

I was used to using buttons to turn the page, access the menu, etc.  This unit has screen sensitivity.  While it is much faster than the older Kindle, I find that it is difficult to avoid inadvertent screen touches that change the page or change the fond or something else.  The surface of the frame, front and back, is smooth and slippery.  It would have been very helpful to have used a rubberized surface."",OK - But Difficult to Hold / Use";;;;;;
"4.0 out of 5 stars,""If you want a good e reader, this is just fine.  No glare on the screen as with a tablet.  It is not lit in any way, so you need to read it like a print book - with lighting.

You can access the notes and translations to modern English with one touch. I haven't used x-ray yet.  Download is quick, even with a so-so internet connection.  The device is comfortable to hold.  I have mine in a book-type case.Pro:  Easy to read screen.  Comfortable and light.  Easy to navigate.  Responsive. Reasonable price.Con:  No audio for audible books.

Essentially, you can control which books they have access to.There is also a parental controls section where you can turn off options such as access to the kindle store, you can limit or exclude access to your personal library so kids cannot access your adult books.Battery life is great!

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""Amazing dedicated e-reader.First off I want to say that I had complications syncing some books that aren't directly from amazon. Initially I downloaded them to my computer and then transferred them to the kindle via a USB cable, but this did not sync them to the cloud. In order to sync them you must email the file to your kindle, this will then sync the books to your library. You can find the email of your kindle by going to Settings -> Device Options ->Personalize Your Kindle. Under Send-to Kindle Email it will display the email you should send your books to. Once you email the files they will automatically load onto your device and sync across all devices.So far I am impressed by the device and will probably enjoy much more reading in the future. Being able to just have the book with you in a few seconds without having to obtain a physical copy is really useful.Additionally, it's also really useful being able to tap and hold on a word and having it's dictionary definition pop up."",""Great Device, In order to sync non-Amazon ebooks, email the file to your kindle.""";;;;;;

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""These Kindles have worked great with my kids. As parents, our favorite part is that we immediately logged each one we received into Kindle FreeTime and had the books we'd already assigned to their profiles show up. You know. Safe books. Not the plethora of free erotica floating around Amazon's cloud (sheesh). We then got to snicker as we watched our kids whine and complain that they couldn't get into apps (like you can on the Kindle Fire) and play Minecraft 24/7. We're evil like that. A minute later, they'd figured out the simple touch screen commands and found the books and then they disappeared to read some of their favorites. Blessed, blessed quiet.

"3.0 out of 5 stars,""Five months and many books later, I haven't changed my opinion of this Kindle reader. I would gladly trade it in for an earlier model.Maybe I'm old school, but this Kindle is inferior to my older one:1. I miss the page turn """"paddles"""" that made my previous Kindle so easy to read. I now have to touch the screen in the """"right"""" area to turn pages.2. With my old Kindle, I could dive deeper and deeper into the Dictionary and pop out when I was done. With my new Kindle, I get a first level definition, but no ability to define words in the definition or link to related topics. I also can't type in words to explore as I'm reading.3. My new Kindle is subject to unintended interactions via the touch screen. I don't know about you, but I often read before I go to sleep, or, more precisely, as I'm going to sleep. This means that I may interact with the screen when my fingers slip or my glasses fall off or .... I too often jerk awake and discover that the font has been adjusted to microscopic or gigantic or that I've paged forward or backward to some indeterminate point in the book I'm reading.Overall, I preferred the previous Kindle, whose screen broke when I dropped it on a hard floor as I fell asleep. I don't think the touch screen has enhanced my reading experience overall."",Kindle Touch Screen not an Improvement";;;;;;

The finger swipe took a bit to get used to.  The new kindle is also bulkier...due to the touch technology, I'm sure, but I liked the light, sleek design of the last version.Lastly...they say pages turn much faster...but if anything, the page turn feels a bit slower to me, and after using the device only a couple times, it's already been freezing on me a bit.  At the base of it, the kindle is still the best ereader out there (in my opinion) and when this one eventually goes, either through technical failure or loss, I'll surely get another...but I've gotta say, I do miss the last generation a bit."",... hotel that refused to send it to me (that bad review went on another site) so when I went ...";;;;;;
"4.0 out of 5 stars,""I have owned a kindle keyboard for the past 3 + years and have really liked it but I started getting black lines on pages and have to flip back and forth to get rid of it. Since I am unsure how long it will chug along I decided to bite the bullet when this was on sale. I will say that the pages are much easier to read on this Kindle and can even read in sunlight which I had trouble doing on my other one. This Kindle is much lighter but I actually prefer it a bit heavier. Touchscreen very responsive but I do prefer the physical buttons. I realize that everything is going to touchscreen and most folks prefer that, but am of the AARP generation and change is not always my friend. I did find that I kept accidentally turning pages at times so I got a case which seems to help and adds a bit of volume which feels better to me since it is so much smaller than kindle keyboard. One of the definite improvements is that apparently your collections are kept in the cloud so when I have to eventually replace it won't have to spend all that time reforming my collections. My one big complaint is the reading progress option. My old kindle has small black vertical lines along the bottom so you can see progress in each chapter. This kindle gives the options of locations, time left in chapter or book, or nothing. Hate the locations option since it means nothing to me. How about an actual page number option? As far as the time left in chapter it is way off. It currently shows I have one or two minutes left of reading but still have at least 6 or 7 pages left. Apparently my kindle thinks I'm a speed reader extraordinaire. These are just minor annoyances and I can easily live with them since it's so convenient and easy to use. Battery life is very good. Depending on how much I'm reading charge can last for one week (if reading a lot) or a lot longer if not reading too much. Battery will drain much faster if you leave WiFi on so I just turn it on occasionally to sync or to download a book. Setup is very easy. Just make sure to have WiFi available and know how to connect to it or you will be really frustrated. I would also recommend getting a cover for it to keep screen clean and help prevent you from accidentally turning pages.12/18 Update.

But the on-line pages are worthless, too.User's guide doesn't answer a lot of basic questions, such as how to make the reader show page numbers instead of locations or time remaining to finish the book.Downloading books or other items from the Cloud to the device must be done one item at a time.  Even at 30 seconds per item, for my 263 items that's more than two hours.  So, I'm supposed to download just what I want for the next few days - BUT I PAID FOR ALL 263 ITEMS and I don't always know which one I'm going to want two days from now.  So, I'm supposed to buy a 3G unit which can access the network when I'm away from home - why didn't Amazon tell me that before I paid nearly $100 for this version - and why should I have to keep spending more and more money to access what I have already paid for?

I have found the technology of electronic ink to be fascinating, and have been interested in eReaders for a while, but I just love the feel and convenience of an actual BOOK.Then my wife won a Kindle at a contest and gave it to me.I have to admit, I do love it.  It is much easier for me to find the books I want to read, and the touch screen makes it easy to navigate.  The best part is the fact that I can look up works or wikipedia articles by just tapping on a word or phrase.  I can highlight phrases and bookmark them to come back later (which has been very useful in books rife with latin).  I can translate words of other languages in the same manner.  And if I run into a word I don't know, it saves it to the """"vocabulary builder"""" so that I can look it up later and actually improve my vocabulary.  With the ability to scroll through pages quickly, it turns out that the Kindle is just as convenient to navigate as a book and more convenient when it comes to dictionaries and the like.

I rightly suspected the book's scan was poor and started playing around with the Experimental browser and was instantly reassured of the display's quality. Then I decided it was time to look at some of the books I got on Kindle Apps in the past (mostly free classics). I quickly discovered I couldn't stand to read Tale of Two Cities without the discussions we had in English Class back in the day. I set out and bought a few small eBooks about some things I was interested in and read them (small books), I then decided that eBook reading is right for me which I never would have suspected.The only downside is the experimental browser needs a little work. I don't expect Miracles, but I would like to be able to read news sites without it crashing. I didn't expect this feature at purchase, but if this were updated a bit so I could read CNN, Fox News, BBC, etc without the browser crashing out it would be perfect.Rundown:Display: Exceeds expectations, sharper than I imagined, sharp as or sharper than a printed pageConnectivity: Excellent, WiFi and USB connectivity that works out of the box on a Mac.Content Availability: Perfect, Content from Amazon and from PDF files can easily be loadedEase of use: took me a few minutes to learn, but perfect.Browser: Needs work, but not really the reason you buy one of theseLastly, I now love reading, I used to be like """"Who has time and space for books,"""" now I can actually read and enjoy it."",You will regret not buying this sooner.";;;;;;

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""The Kindle E-Reader makes reading so enjoyable.  I love being able to hold up this very light weight device, without trying to hold pages open at the same time.  It is so easy to use, and I love that I can take hundreds of books with me wherever I go.  The Kindle E-Reader was a revolutionary device years ago, but it still holds up today as a great device, even in a world of iPads, iPad Mini's, iPhone Plus, Android Tablets and smaller laptops.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""After years of debate, we broke down and got ourselves two kindles. The basic model but 7th gen. Exactly what we need and wanted. No back lighting, but hey that's why there's the sun and/or lamps, right? :)"",Love Them (2)!";;;;;;
"4.0 out of 5 stars,""This review is targeted to those completely new to kindles since I noticed most of the other reviews seem to assume familiarity with other kindle products.My background: For the past five years I've been doing most of my book reading on either my iPad or iPhone (yes, I find reading books on my phone quite comfortable actually!). The problem with both of them is the LIGHT, they're just too shiny to read in bed while I'm trying to fall asleep(even with the """"invert colors"""" option turned on). It was either get more and more paper books (inconvenient), or try something else. Hence, the basic kindle.I chose the basic kindle because despite reading a ton of reviews, I couldn't figure out what was so great about the kindle Paperwhite(119$) or kindle Voyager(199$) compared with $79 for the basic kindle. They have more bells and whistles but the core functionality appears to be the same. So far I think I made the right choice.CONS(1) It feels very cheap and plastic compared to an iPad. But this is not surprising considering the price difference.(2) The screen responds very slowly. Scrolling through a large amount of text is PAINFUL. But in reality this is not a problem since page turning inside a book is really the only thing you need to do most of the time and that part is fine.(3) If you don't pay the extra 20.00 you get ads at the bottom of the home screen. But these ads are not too obtrusive. I don't plan on paying.PROS(1) The screen is PERFECT for reading in bed because it emits NO LIGHT. It's the same as reading a paperback. Of course you would need to have a lamp on, but I think that's good as I don't think reading in the dark with just the light from an electronic device would be good for your eyes.(2) You can browse and buy books directly from the kindle. Warning: Your account is charged and books download INSTANTLY when you click """"Buy"""", there is no confirmation screen. This is convenient if you know exactly what you want, but it's easier to do browsing on a regular computer due to the aforementioned painfully slow screen.(3) Easy to use, stays charged for a long time(I haven't tested their claim of """"weeks"""", but based on the low power usage I could believe it), automatically syncs across all your kindle device, all the good things you would expect.Overall, I think this is good value if you(1) Read books in the sun where screen glare could be a problem.(2) Want to read in bed and don't like the bright light from from most electronic displays.I can't say if the other more advanced kindle versions are worth the extra money, but so far I'm liking this one."",A Review for total Kindle newbies";;;;;;
"4.0 out of 5 stars,""Okay, truth be told, I think the best e-reader on the market is the kindle paperwhite. Hands down. However, I got the regular kindle on sale for $30 cheaper than the current retail. So of course I'm going to get this one instead of the paperwhite.The entry level kindle is not bad, and honestly, I like this one better than the previous generation, which is what my boyfriend has. I don't know why some people have a hard time navigating this kindle because I have had no problems with it. Yes, sometimes I double click on a page by mistake but I can easily swipe back. And I like how I can touch the top of the screen so I can get to the main menu. Truth be told, I am a slow learner with electronics and I thought this version is easier to navigate than the last version. With the last version, I had a hard time going back and forth to the main menu and worrying about losing my place. Not with this kindle. And it's so easy for me to put bookmarks on this device! That way I can flip through different pages and books and go back to where I'd like to read!And I like that this kindle is easy on the eyes. Previously I was reading on my iPad, which was such a pain. The anti-glare makes it so easy to zip through the pages.Other tidbits:- no backlight. Kinda wish it did, but this is the """"economy"""" kindle. Don't expect to read this in dim lighting.- make sure you download overdrive or your local library's app so you can send kindle-friendly books directly to your kindle! I've borrowed several books that were transferred on my kindle. No worries on late fees since the book is automatically returned when the loan period is up.- I don't know why Amazon shows videos of all their kindles hovering over water. This thing is NOT waterproof, but I think most people know that.- you can browse the Internet on a kindle but I don't recommend it. For some moronic reason I did that out of curiosity and it froze my kindle. Should've known better given that it's 4 GBs.Overall, I'm pretty satisfied with my kindle! I expect to read on it for many years to come!"",Easy Reader";;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I already had the  several Nooks but after getting Amazon Prime I decided to get an Kindle for the free monthly book loan program.  The Kindle special offers are shown on the locked page. The ads do not interfere with reading a book. With WiFi the books are easily downloaded. There is no glare in the sunlight.  Tap the edge to turn the paper, nothing easier.  The added dictionary is great. What I like most is the ability to get information on the characters with just a touch.Update: 03/08/2015I had stopped using the actual Kindle for about a month. Through  Prime  Free Book  download , the book is only available on the actual Kindle not through the Kindle app on my phone.  Fine, but I carry my phone more than my Kindle.When I wanted to go read the book I had down loaded. I realized I forget the correct name. It took a few minutes to find the book.It would be nice if the Kindle had a recent read tab.  If it's been a while, the recent read tab will still have the book near the top. At the present time the only categories are by recent download , Author or collection.It is nice that PDF formatted books are able to be downloaded.  So many Authors allow you to get their book free online. I download on my phone and send to my Kindle. It appears as a Doc on the Kindle and on the phone app.Other than the problem reading Free  Prime book, I am extremely pleased with the Kindle. So much so that I have ordered the Kindle Fire for my Daughter who  preference had been her Nook HD."",With WiFi the books are easily downloaded. There is no glare in the sunlight";;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""As somebody who is a book lover, I have always resisted the readers.  There's just something about holding a book in your hands and smelling the pages.  (I know, I'm a nerd!)  But with a purse that already weighs more than it should, carrying around my current book isn't always feasible.  That is why I gave in to the social pressure and decided to give the Kindle a try.  Needless to say, I'm not disappointed.  I've had the unit for nearly a month now and while I don't use it everyday, I certainly do use it with regularity- but I have yet to charge it from it's original charge!  Blew my mind!!  While that alone makes it amazing, having access to a virtual library in a unit that weighs the same as a paperback book is more than I can put into words!  I can even change the font, so if I forgot my cheaters I can still manage to read the words, and I literally just have to tap the screen to turn the page.  While I'm still not willing to give up the real thing, I definitely consider myself a fan of the Kindle!!"",I'm not disappointed. I've had the unit for nearly a month ...";;;;;;
"4.0 out of 5 stars,""I bought this when it was on sale for $20 off the usual price (lowering it to a price I was willing to pay in order to experiment with an e-reader).  I initially had the free offers version, but found that often the Kindle had trouble waking up from the ads when I swiped to start reading.  That was very annoying, so once I decided that I liked the Kindle and wanted to keep it I was really happy to find that I could just pay the $20 difference to have the Kindle updated to remove the ads.  Haven't regretted getting rid of them since. I wish there was a light built in, and if in the future I decide I need a new e-reader I'll probably want to get one with that feature, but for now I'm happy with my experiment.  I still really enjoy reading actual paper books, but I also like reading them on the Kindle.  It always remembers exactly where I am in the book, even if I have to check out an e-book more than once in order to finish reading it. That's a wonderful convenience.  I use this a lot on the go since it's small, relatively light and easy to use. My iPad is much more cumbersome and heavy. It doesn't go too many places with me any more.  This Kindle will display the pictures in a book, but not all that clearly.  It's not made for impressive graphics.  I'm okay with that.  This is just a good, basic way to read books.  If you've been thinking of trying one out, go for it.  Amazon gives you 30 days to decide whether to keep it or not."",""That was very annoying, so once I decided that I liked the ...""";;;;;;
"4.0 out of 5 stars,""This kindle replaced my old keyboard style kindle when I fell and it went out of commission. I have had this one for about three weeks.  I love this new version but am having some frustration with the touch screen It has a hair trigger and too often I find wikipedia and other stuff popping up when I only wanted to turn the page. Sometimes it goes forward when I want to g back, and although I consistently set it to the font size I need, it somehow changes even when I am sure I was holding it only by the cover and not touching the screen.

"4.0 out of 5 stars,""Great deal on this, it still costs more than a FIRE but this is a touch screen. I had last purchased a Kindle e reader in 2011 and it was one that had a small keyboard on the face of it as well as audio capability.  This new one does not have audio capability so totally discounts the ability to use Audible on this device.  I do not like full color devices to read with and for now this will do, but I am disappointed that my older Kindle died as it was perfect.  This one seems a bit smaller with the viewing area being smaller than my previous 6 inch kindle.

"1.0 out of 5 stars,""I am very disgusted with the Kindles with the touchscreen.  A friend gave me a Kindle several years ago and I loved it.  It did give me good service for years before it finally just gave out.  The Kindle I had, you clicked the side (either side) to turn the page.  I could not afford a new one so my daughter gave me hers and got a Kindle Fire.  Her Kindle is only about 2 years old and I hate it!  With the old one I could find the last page I read without any problem.  This one jumps around or jumps to the first of the book and you have to search page by page to find where you were.  Sometimes when you press to turn the page it doesn't turn the page or skips ahead several pages.  Sometimes I don't even have to touch the screen and it turns the page.  With my old Kindle I could delete books I have already read.  This one I can not.  Now the only Kindle you offer without having to touch the screen cost $199!  I thought the policy of any company was to make better products (not worse products) at better prices.  Not so with Kindle!"",Older Kindle's much better than the newer ones.";;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I finally got a Kindle because I had to take a 3-week trip to Rotterdam from California. I knew I would never be able to carry as many books as I would need, especially since we were going to need to carry a number of things back with us.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I've long been an e-reader skeptic.  However, after finally trying my wife's Kindle, I decided I had to get my own.  I'm thrilled with it, and here's why:Travel:  I read a lot, and I read fast.  I usually go through a book in the course of the plane flight alone.  Add a couple more books to cover the flight back and the trip itself, and the weight and volume start to add up.  With the Kindle, I can bring a dozen books and take up less than the weight and volume of one!Finding new authors: I found my favorite authors by borrowing books from the library in my teens.  Now that I'm in my forties, a lot of them have died or retired, and I've read everything they wrote.

The pages are easy to turn with the touch screen display. Naturally, it is not as fast an an IPad but it serves its purpose and performs wonderfully.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I was looking for a dedicated e-reader to avoid distractions from a tablet and the eye strain of a back-lit screen so I opted for the traditional Kindle.

I live in a new york apartment and I don't have the space for a ton of books that I want to read so I want to start using the Kindle for reading to save space and be able to take it when I travel. Years ago I traveled cross-country by train and the weight and bulk of even just a half dozen books was a pain.

I like to read several books at once and have plenty of options, so if you are the same and travel a lot, this is something that is wonderful. I will update my review after a few more months to see if it stands the test of time. I expect the battery life to go down a bit, as all electronics, but so far I am impressed with this Kindle."",Great Product";;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I used to read books on my phone, and I was really missing out. Reading on a kindle is a completely different experience, and I love it. The screen is a great size, and perfectly light to hold with one hand. The touch controls are responsive. Settings are simple and everything is fuss-free. This is much closer to how one might read an actual book - without the interruption of text message and email alerts, on pages that look so much like ink and paper. And the battery lasts for weeks!"",I love my kindle!";;;;;;
"4.0 out of 5 stars,""I bought my first kindle touch 5 years ago. After it stopped working I decided to get a new one. The newest model of the kindle touch looks great. I will go over the pros and cons of this kindle, and wether it is right for you. Pros: The kindle store gives special prices to kindle owners.(books are cheaper since they are e-books). Yesterday I got 3 books that would cost me about 70 in total for 15 bucks. This kindle's battery is great. With average use, about 2-3 hours of reading per day, this kindle should last about 5 days to a whole week. Its touch! Amazon got rid of the home button making this kindle completely touch. The touch is a bit more accurate than the older versions, and in my opinion, does not have to refresh as much as much.(when the screen turns black for a second). This pro is more like the first one which concerns all kindle users"; The classics like, hamlet and such are completely free. I had to get one of the classics for a class, which cost $20 for the paperback. Its completely free in the kindle store! You can get this kindle for a reduced price if you choose to have special offers included. This just means there will be book ads, which are not at all obtrusive, and might even help you find a great new book to read. If you I do not know what a word means, I can just tap and hold the word and a definition will pop up. This is great for reading hard books like the scarlet letter. Cons: Screen is delicate;" a case is a must for this kindle. The screen is glare free, but if the light is right over you, like in a room it will be impossible to read without changing position. The display's resolution is not that high, and if u focus on the letters you can see the pixels, which I don't mind that much, but its still a con I guess. I do not like that the battery is not removable since it will hold less charge as time passes. I really like this kindle, but the fact that you can't without light is sometimes annoying. I did not write this as a con because there is a kindle with built in lights, but its more expensive."",A great product for a great price.";;;;
3.0 out of 5 stars,I did not realize that there is no light to it.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I had an older model Kindle that my son gave me for Christmas in 2011. While reading late one night, I dropped it and only about half the screen now works. I have quite a few unread books in the library and I continued reading one that I was about halfway through on my laptop computer. Though it is nice to be able to read the books on more than one device, a laptop is nowhere near as convenient as the Kindle so I decided to buy a new one.My old Kindle had a keyboard, but I never used it, so this model is working out fine for me. I wasn't sure how I would adjust to not having the little buttons on each side to flip pages, but I have very quickly adjusted to tapping the screen to move to the next page. (You should know that I am a dinosaur and do not use a smart phone, so I am not used to using a fingertip to change screens). Since this is a much newer model, on the home page there are pictures of the book cover rather than just titles listed like there were on the old model. They are in black and white, but at least a little more interesting than just a one line title and author.I pretty much use a computer to decide what titles I want, and to purchase them, and just use this device to actually read books. It's great for reading novels or non-fiction but I don't like it for reading textbooks. After 4 years of college and 7 years of graduate school, I need a real book with paper pages and a yellow highlighter to read textbooks. All in all, I am happy with the new model, no frills, Kindle."",Though it is nice to be able to read the books on more ...";;;;;;
"4.0 out of 5 stars,""Since so many of the reviews on this device are complaints about it not having a light function let me say THIS KINDLE DOES NOT HAVE A FRONTLIGHT.I would like to use this review to convince you NOT to buy the Paperwite or Voyage by comparing things that are important to me.Readability: I know that this model has almost half the PPI (167ppi) as the PW and Voyage  (300ppi) and this is a big selling point for Amazon but it honestly does not make that much of a difference when actually reading. Our brains do most of the work by recognizing symbols and shapes and filling things in so to speak that the text appears very crisp and very easy on the eyes with this device even with the lower ppi. Not a good reason to upgrade.Reading in the dark: The front light is such a gimmick. Not a good enough reason to upgrade IMHO since I can buy a darn good book light (you know, like we used back in the old days) for $4 vs an extra $40 for the PW that has the same functionality as this model (minus the light). I had the PW first gen and the light was really blotchy  and i personally noticed that my eyes strained when reading with that bluish white backlight for long periods at a time vs having the book light shining from above. This is just a personal preference, you'll have to decide for yourself which you prefer. I will say however that if your partner is very sensitive to light you might want to get the PW since you can turn the light down very low and squint to read that way.Design: All 3 kindle models are pretty basic looking tbh, not a good reason to upgrade. This model does NOT have the rubbery back that the PW has and is a very smooth plastic that makes it very slippery in the hands. I have found that both the PW and this Basic model are very easy to scratch and ruin the screen as my keys did when i put the PW in my purse. The good news however is that there are so many beautiful cheap cases on this site that remedy this. I purchased the Walnew Kindle 7th Gen Colorful Painting Smartshell Case - The Thinnest and Lightest Leather Cover for Amazon Kindle (With 6"""" Glare-free Touchscreen and it does not add any bulk to the device and has a textured feeling making it easy to hold when reading. Cons: The Basic and PW both have the indented screen that is forever catching dust and crumbs in the corners and it drives me nuts and the voyage is the only model that has the smooth front. I refuse to pay $199 for a dedicated ereader though.Battery life: Same on all 3 IF you go easy on the light with the PW and Voyage. Hasn't been an issue. I should mention that none of the devices come with a wall plug but in this day and age honestly most people probably step on these regularly around the house. I certainly don't need another.This basic model is the definition of """"good enough"""" for its purpose as a dedicated ereader. And since I'm mildly irritated at the rate Amazon is cranking out these """"upgraded"""" kindles I have made a list of things I consider worthy of an upgrade. (BTW, If your thinking about buying an older version of the Kindle IT IS STILL SUPPORTED and you can still buy ebooks to send to the device).The only reason I'll ever upgrade:1. If Amazon FINALLY makes a waterproof Kindle for reading in the tub or on the beach. I have spilled tea on my Basic Kindle before and since there is not that many entrances (like a headphone jack or something) it survived just fine. I'd feel more secure about reading in the tub if I knew it was tested as waterproof though.2. If Amazon brings back the headphone jack for listening to audiobooks. I think they will probably have to make the storage expandable or offer more GBs if they do this since I think audio would take up more space than text. If this a concern for you the Kindle Keyboard (3rd gen) DOES have the headphone jack and i'm certain you can find a used one around going strong.Also Amazon seriously needs to get on the ball with the typography. Also very annoyed that EPUB is still not supported (you can convert ebooks with Calibre, but its a hassle) and that I am only allowed to lend books ONCE for like two weeks."",I would like to use this review to convince you NOT to ...";;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I've always been a """"physical book"""" type of of person, so I really wasn't sure if I would enjoy the kindle. However, I bought it for myself (and my mother) because it was on black Friday sale. Surprisingly, I absolutely love it! I'm currently reading the Outlander series by Diana Gabaldon (for those who don't know, the books average around 1000 pages, even going up to about 1500 pages), and it has made reading so much easier! I'm a graduate student, so I like to steal time for reading for pleasure when I can, and trying to manipulate a 1400 page book while eating a sandwich is really hard! :) The kindle is easier to hold (no flipping of pages or trying to get the book to stay open), and is really easy on the eyes. I find that my eyesight (previously better than 20/20) has worsened since spending so much time in front of a computer (thanks grad school :/), but this screen is designed for prolonged periods of reading. I really couldn't recommend it more! (although I will still continue to fill my bookshelves!)"",so I really wasn't sure if I would enjoy the kindle";;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""Having been a long-time user of the original Kindle, which itself was a 5-star product without a doubt, this later model is even lighter in weight and simpler to use, while providing the user with the same screen size and glare-free features.  Congratulations to Amazon on the ideal product for travelers and overseas residents who find it difficult to get printed books, and for those who prefer digital reading wherever they may be."",""Simpler, lighter and even better than the original Kindle reader.""";;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I was """"upgrading"""" from an original Kindle that I've had for years.  I was nervous about the touch screen";" would it be responsive like my """"click"""" original one?

Just as easy to figure out and use. I love it! It is a great low-cost reader!~  I still love the Non-backlit option because I am more old-school as far as I want it to be more book-like.  I don't read my books on my tablet..I save them for the Kindle."",Nice reader for a low investment";;;;;
"4.0 out of 5 stars,""Bought this primarily to have a non backlit device for reading before bed time as studies show that ambient lighting results in greater restfulness during sleep, similar to a book.

The native browser was a surprise, now I have to resist the temptation to check my email while off the clock and on holiday. Pretty amazing battery life overall, even with the WiFi on. Screen refresh is a bit slow and annotating is clunky but given that a change goes for a couple of weeks, I am not complaining."",The  Browser was a surprise";;;;;;
"4.0 out of 5 stars,""I do love this kindle. I bought it after I dropped my last Kindle in the hot tub (it will not survive, don't do it!) I think it was a 3rd generation, so this is an upgrade, I like most of the new features, although I was really excited to have the """"X-ray"""" feature reading Game of Thrones, and it's not available for all books (and not GOT). I do wish there were more options for non-touchscreen so I could more easily use it in the hot tub more responsibly--I'll have to find one of those electronic cases with clear spot for touch screens on the front. This one weighs a little bit more than my old one, but it feels substantial. The only issue I've had is when trying to find some plastic that would let the touchscreen still work through it, the plastic not only didn't work, it messed with the touchscreen and freaked it out a few times, but since I quit trying, it's been fine. It's also a little bit harder to highlight, but with all the new features, it was just hard to find, and I know I just need to get used to how to use it. Overall, this a great basic eReader, definitely recommended, and a very good value for the price."",I do love my Kindle";;;;;;
5.0 out of 5 stars,The Kindle is a worthwhile investment for me as it will help to remove the myriad paperbacks that I own. The only issue that I found was accidentally ending up on prime ( had to shut it off).  Actually the Kindle was a bit of a stretch for me since I am a paper book person.  I do like the cheaper prices for books though and being able to enlarge the print for those most of the day reading sessions.,A good investment;;;;;;
"4.0 out of 5 stars,""I was pleasantly surprised with this Kindle. I've never had an e-Reader before, so I wasn't really sure what it expect. It was really on sale (Cyber Monday) on Amazon so I went ahead and ordered it to try it out.It seems pretty fast and works well. The user interface is a bit quirky, but I got used to it quickly. I wish it had text-to-speech capability to read books to me when I'm unable to look at it, but I can live without it.The screen is a little bit harder to see than paper, but not too bad. Sometimes the background seems to have a bit of a yellow tinge to it, which is odd and sometimes distracting, but not terrible.Battery life seems great. So far I've been reading it for many hours (8-10?) and it's still got more than half charge.It's very light and even fits in my back pocket! I wouldn't recommend sitting down with it there, though.I'd say it's definitely an improvement over paperbacks and hardcovers!"",Pleasantly surprised";;;;;;
4.0 out of 5 stars,After 3 plus years of constant use my first Kindle died.  This was the closest replacement model.  I wanted one that did not have a backlit screen and one that I could use outside.  I have a kindle fire and that which is impossible outside on a sunny day.  This Kindle has many features the other didn't have at the same price.  But if you are reading a book and want to get home you have to make sure you touch the screen in the exactly the right way and in the right place or you get stuck the dictionary or font size or highlight or whatever.  Also pages will jump just by jiggling the kindle.  The touch screen on the Kindle and Kindle Fire work differently.  You can drive yourself nuts switching between them.,I loved my old Kindle.  I just like this one.;;;;;;

There are no connections for a lighted case, and I am very angry about it.  This thing is dollar store quality, unlike the one it replaced, and if Amazon thinks this is a strategic ploy to get me to spend more money on a 'fancier' one...well that's an epic fail.  I'll be returning this piece of crap and switching to Nook.

"4.0 out of 5 stars,""The good:The matte screen is easier to read than a smart phone, so it's good for reading in long stretches. The touch sensitivity is good. The Kindle feels sturdy. The weight of it feels fine. The battery life is fine: I don't have to worry about it dying.The bad:I wish its case was not as slippery. I keep it in a cover, so it's not a big deal for me.It seems book collections made on it can't be imported to Kindle for PC, which makes it less useful. Making collections on the Kindle isn't fun.The experimental browser doesn't work as well as I want. It hung loading a site. I have read that mobile sites work better.The user interface could be better: A dialog box asking if I wanted something should have buttons saying yes or no, not OK and Cancel. But the UI is usable and it's out of the way when reading a book.Overall it's good for people who like to read a lot."",Pretty good";;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""This was a great purchase.  I had a kindle 2nd generation that I was very happy with.  I was reluctant to upgrade over concerns some of the reviewers stated regarding the touch screen sensitivity and clarity.  I was also concerned about registration and not having access to previous books I had purchased.  I also had concerns about charging the battery with the adapter I had for the kindle 2.  Anyway, after a couple of months of consideration and a little more research, my wife convinced me I should buy the new kindle (birthday present), and I am very happy I did.  It works great.  All of my concerns were unfounded.  First of all it is much lighter and smaller than the kindle 2 (without sacrificing screen size).  It is easy to navigate using the touch screen and the drop down menus.  Registration was seamless, previous titles are readily available on the amazon cloud, and the battery charger adapter works fine.  Great product for those who love to read.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I bought two of these just in time to take with me on a three-week vacation.

The experimental browser is, well, experimental I guess. I didn't buy the Kindle for the browser, so I'm glad that it had one at all.

1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst service I have ever received from Amazon and it will now determine if I ever buy a kindle again. The dedicated e reader kindle is shown as a paperwhite unless you read the very fine print that shows the $79  one is not actually a paperwhite it is just a regular kindle with touch screen. The advertising is completely misleading here and I was on the phone with amazon for over 40mins and all they wanted to do was sell me the new $200 kindle  or sell me a refurbished kindle for $99 both being the paperwhites?????? I was then transferred over to a supervisor who then started all over again to sell me a $200 kindle??????????????????????????????  very very very poor customer service,kindle paperwhites are all not the same;;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""This review is for the 7th Generation Kindle, which is now touch-screen only and has no buttons except for the lock/power button. All typing has been transferred to an in-screen keyboard popup. I love mine but some people really like their old kindle with the QWERTY keyboard buttons at the bottom. In nay case, the kindle is a great investment for book-worms with its multitude of features and has potential for web-browsing (on occasion), especially if Amazon improves on the experimental browser in the future (see review below).**** READABILITY & TEXT SCALING ****Kindle's e-ink technology re-creates an experience similar to reading a paperback book. I liken it to looking at an expensive etch-a-sketch. Text is crisp and easily readable. Contrast excellent. Despite its screen size (3 '' W x 4.75'' H or  9cm x 12 cm), you can scale text from the very smallest all the way up to the very largest. Like a book, reading in daylight or sun, is not a problem (but you may need sunglasses, obviously). At night, you'll need a light source to read.**** SEND CONTENT TO KINDLE. FROM ANYWHERE. AMAZON CLOUD ****Kindle servers will convert your content for the kindle for free. Works with most file formats -- even the text will be scalable. PDFs, however, are not scalable (and treated like an image). All content you send to yourself will be stored on the AmazonCloud drive (5GB of free storage). Be sure to read up on this cool feature--- I love it-- a definite plus for me: http://www.amazon.com/sendtokindle/**** LIBRARIES AND EBOOKS ****Many libraries in the US now allow you to access digital content (not just ebooks) and check them out while at home. No visit to the library required. I did this for the first time last week. I checked out two ebooks. Process was easy and ebooks delivered to my kindle in under a minute. If an ebook is checked out, I can put a hold on it (and, optionally, have it delivered to my kindle once it is available). Amazon will email you if a book becomes free, or when a book is due. Be sure you learn how to return a book (hint: deleting will be required).**** HIGHLIGHTS & ANNOTATIONS ****Kindle has incorporated ways to highlight and annotate passages using your finger. The best part is that all your markings and text will be uploaded to the cloud when you sync your kindle (along with page location of the book). Access and manage them here at anytime -- this is a really cool feature when writing yourself notes to look-up things later: https://kindle.amazon.com/your_highlights**** DICTIONARY / WORDWISE ****Keep learning words you don't know. Select an unfamiliar word and kindle will look it up for you using a standard dictionary and/or wikipedia (with a WiFi connection). Kindle can even keep track of words you've looked up. Test yourself using the the flashcards feature. WordWise is a predictive dictionary feature (available in some books) to suggest alternate meanings for complicated words (in between lines of text, pre-empting a dictionary search). Respected language dictionaries are available for English and most languages (for free!).**** COLLECTIONS ****""""Collections"""" allow you to sort books into your kindle and sync across multiple devices, instead of paging through multiple screens of all your content. Two important things to know before doing so:* collections are not file folders--merely tags-- but it will appear as if your books are in a folder on the kindle (but they actually are not)* collections created using kindle software apps on PC or Mac will not sync to your actual kindle. (Spare yourself my initial frustration and sort books into collections using only the a kindle or ipad. Trust me, I called Amazon upset because my collections wouldn't sync and update to the kindle from my computer. Apparently, the sync-ing of collections was disabled a while but there is no documentation of this anywhere)DRAWBACKS**** Experimental Browser ****I like this feature, but it is buggy. You can use the """"experimental browser"""" to surf the web, amazon.com, check email (limited). It will frequently crash, especially with flash content (which it does not support). Amazon.com is fine, however (so you can buy more ebooks). The frustrating part is that when the browser crashes,it re-loads your last visited page... a catch-22 because it loads the page causing it to crash in the first place.* you'll need nimble fingers to hit the back button or the stop loading (x) button in the address bar to resolve the crashing**** Lighting ****It needs a light when it gets dark... but that is because it's supposed to be like a book. Solution: kindle cover/case with in-built or clip-on light.**** Screen Bursts/Reloads ****Eventually, you will get used to that split-second screen burst when the e-ink re-sets itself. This is frequent, but not always, it just depends on the e-ink formatting needs from screen to screen. (Remember, the kindle is like a souped up etch-a-sketch)**** ADDITIONAL TIPS AND RECOMMENDATIONS ********************** BOOKMARK YOUR BROWSER *****Highlights & Annotations: https://kindle.amazon.com/your_highlightsManage Content & Settings: https://www.amazon.com/mn/dcw/myx.htmlAmazonCloud Drive: https://www.amazon.com/clouddrive/**** WiFi vs. Whispernet ****Be sure you learn the difference between sending content to yourself for free (via a WiFi connection) or Whispernet (not free, charges apply--I haven't used this feature so far).**** Kindle Case/Cover ****Protect your investment with a kindle case or cover. I could imagine the screen getting scratched or marked by objects in a backpack, purse, or murse. My $10 case should get here in a couple of days."",Some people really like their old kindle with the QWERTY keyboard";;;;;;
"4.0 out of 5 stars,""First of all I should say that I do love my kindle. This is my third, before which I had a nook. And to date I think this is the best. I prefer this stripped down version to the fancier ones, because just as with a car, the more gadgets and added features there are, the more parts there are that may break. I would rather just read with the light on in the room than rely on a reader to light up for me. I am an advance reader, and I go through two or three books weekly. (The promise of a week of battery power is ridiculous, because it doesn't take into account how much reading one does in a given day.)Those of us with arthritis have been assisted tremendously by the kindle. Sometimes I select very lengthy works that would be huge if I had to handle the physical book. And because of arthritic issues I prefer this version of the basic kindle to the one I just wore out. Not having the buttons down the side, but relying on a touch screen instead, is far easier on the thumbs. And highlighting by touch is far easier on the hands than having to navigate to each individual letter, one click at a time. This version makes it far easier to access footnotes and the dictionary. But there are some kinks that still need to be worked out.I use the features constantly, since I am almost always reading a book with the intent of reviewing it. The touch screen needs improvement. Trying to highlight too far left or too far right sometimes causes the page to turn unexpectedly. Trying to highlight in the topmost 20% causes the tool bar to pop up. It is possible to highlight these areas, but one has to touch it exactly straight on and hold for a moment, and frankly it's a pain in the butt. In addition, the keyboard has a terrible auto correct bar. I have an Android phone that can guess what I want to type very early, but this one has no clue. When using the secondary keyboard for punctuation, the next word after the space bar is tapped should pop up as the main keyboard with letters but it doesn't"; we must move it back manually every stinking time. And try the bookmark! One cannot just tap the upper right corner, because that will either bring up the tool bar or cause a letter nearby to be highlighted. The only way to use the bookmark, therefore, is by first bringing up the tool bar, then selecting bookmark, then tapping a third time to verify that one wants to place a book mark in the corner.For those that don't often use the features and just want to read the book and have the kindle remember your place, it's a pretty good reader. The text is clear, and the font size is easy to change without causing the paragraphs to go out of alignment.The insidious suggestion that we link our Goodreads account to our Amazon account is the worst potential invasion of privacy I can imagine. I began my to-read list, which has hundreds of titles, with the casual intent to read those books if I ran across them;" it was never meant to be a wish list. Of course, all I had to do there is ignore the prominent invitation to link my two accounts, but it's worth noting.All told, if I were going to buy an e-reader again, I would still choose this one. I suspect it is the best on the market right now. But I do hope amazon will also continue to work out the kinks in the features."",""Touch Screen Great for Arthritis, but Many Kinks in Using Tool Bar and Keyboard""";;;;

After a long discussion with a very helpful agent, they confirmed that when books are updated on their system, personal notes and highlights are lost. They gave me a website where I can go to see them once I'm logged in (https://kindle.amazon.com/your_highlights), but they will never again show up on my Kindle device. Strangely, my old notes & highlights show up on the Kindle app on my iPhone. New notes and highlights show up on my Kindle. But I cannot see all of my notes & highlights on either my Kindle device nor on my iPhone.I asked the Amazon agent if they never thought of allowing customers to elect to upgrade to newer versions of books they own with the declared risk that they may lose their own valuable data. The agent said they will put that into their system for consideration.So, I reiterate what I said before. Personal data is more important that hardware.

If you want a simple, non-lit e-reader, I don't think you can go wrong with this one."",The things I like most: Very light--doesn't get wearisome to hold";;;;;;
"4.0 out of 5 stars,""I prefer the text-to-speech feature of previous Kindle models, I am not a person to just sit and read.  I dearly love the text to speech because of its quirks, and mistakes that the author may make. It also helps me with the pronunciation of the off the wall names that the author gives to their characters.  Not all books are available in audible format.  I do not have to worry that the narrator voice will be unpleasant to my ears, this is the biggest reason I do not order many audio books, I just do not like the narrator. So when you come out with a new kindle that has text-to-speech even if only useable with a head set I will gladly buy one.Your,Judy"",Text-to-speech";;;;;;
"2.0 out of 5 stars,""Updated review: I changed my rating from 3 stars to 2 stars for two reasons. First, the screen freezes at seemingly random moments, when the backward tap and the menu tap do not work until I have tapped forward once. Second, and more importantly, the Notes function is more difficult to use than it was with my older Kindle, the one with the button keyboard. I use a Kindle for two reasons: convenience, and the ability to increase font size. The old Kindle allowed font size for Notes to be adjusted";" as best as I can determine, Note fonts on my new Kindle can not be adjusted, and I have difficulty reading them. In addition, the Edit and Delete labels are very small, and it takes several attempts before the Note is deleted. Instead, the tap dismisses the Note and then I have to go back to it and try again.I also have to say that Amazon promotes this Kindle as having a better battery than the older one. No way. At best it's just the same.As an aside, I contacted Amazon Customer Support to ask if Note fonts could be adjusted, and, as usual, they did not answer my question, but sent instructions for adjusting book fonts.Original review:I had an older Kindle with the button keyboard and switches on the side. It is a perfectly fine device, but the switches were starting to opoerate erratically. So I decided to buy another Kindle, and got the 7th generation guy with the touchscreen, just your basic e-reader. It is slightly easier to read on because all I have to do is tap the screen to turn the page, but sometimes that seems to hang up a bit. What I have a problem with is that learning how to use it is slightly less than intuitive, and the on-board documentation is pretty bad. The user's guide is not indexed and the search function is clunky and lists all the results in a bunched-up sentence, not in context. If you want real documentation and instructions for how to perform various functions, you have to use an online search engine.I also struggled with transferring books from the old Kindle because I had a lot of my own books on the old device (which the new guy calls documents). I finally got them all over, but it took a while and the new device keeps giving me unnecessary warnings about syncing issues (that function worked okay, btw).On the whole I'm okay with the new Kindle, especially as a physical object, but the software could use a focus group."",""It is a perfectly fine device, but the switches were starting to opoerate ...""";;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I like this new kindle as I am so accustomed to touch screens I was irritated when I had to use a keyboard on my old second generation. It took no time at all to figure out home, return etc.  I chose to go with the kindle instead purchasing a kindle fire because I like reading outside and a backlit kindle is the only way to do it. They are a special segment of the electronic devices.  This model is smaller without the keyboard which I like for carrying in my purse on airplanes. I didn't like the kindle version of nupro cover that wouldn't stay closed if in a purse. Hated the feel of it, because I would rather be holding a book instead of a tablet so I got one of the leather-like covers made by Elsse. It is really nice and has the front flap pocket for my plane boarding passes. There was some frustration in Amazon's writeup of covers because I didn't know for sure if the cover was for the 6 inch display. They just mentioned 7th generation and I had no idea what generation it was. I noticed they fixed that on one of the pink Elsse covers.  I hope the touch screen works for a long time. My old 2nd gen was typing in U's on the search bar at the bottom covering up the last line of every page so hopefully this one will last as long as it did. Many years, and many books later."",Like the touchscreen.";;;;;;

"3.0 out of 5 stars,""This is a whole library that I can hold in one hand!  I love to read but have limited space in my house, so it is really convenient to have this eReader where I can access a world of books.  It has my Bible, dictionary and other reference materials and I can access almost every book ever published.  I also find that many books are not issued in print anymore and I have them in my Kindle collection.THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT BATTERY LIFE.  I love that I can read for weeks with a single charge, but you have to be careful and use a Kindle knowledgeably because there are a few basic rules you must follow to prevent damage to the battery.  Just call Amazon Kindle help before your first use and they will be able to help you get set up safely.  You shouldn't over charge and you shouldn't try to use the Kindle while it is charging.  And you should never let it run completely down.  These things could damage the battery.  You should also know that a wifi internet connection drains the battery very fast.  Only connect to the internet while downloading a book, and when done, disconnect from the internet for low energy reading.  You cannot replace the battery on a Kindle so when you've used up all your charges, you must discard this device and buy a new Kindle.  I think if they wanted to, they could make these to last, but there is no profit in that, so remember that KINDLES ARE DISPOSABLE and your best course of action is to be aware of how to take care of your battery and give it maximum life.Another drawback is that Kindles are TINY.  They are not a good choice for cookbooks or for color magazines or for an atlas that needs a large page size to appreciate.  And Kindles are black & white only.  If you want a large screen and color display, you will have to move up to a tablet, but be aware that Kindle reading is extremely hard on the battery life of a tablet.One of my favorite features is that this particular Kindle is the cheapest because IT HAS NO BACKLIGHT.  This is considered a negative by some people, but I find that hours of staring into a backlit screen causes eyestrain.  This inexpensive Kindle is the easiest for me to read and I wish people could realize what constant backlit screen time does to one's eyes.I dont' think Kindle will ever completely replace print books.  I still have a small collection of my favorites in high quality hardbound editions.  But for general reading, this is an awesome compliment to my print collection."",""Great Addition to My Print Library, but Will Never Replace Old Fashioned Books""";;;;;;

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I received the new kindle as a Fathers' Day 2015 gift from our youngest son. He gave me the kindle glare-free touchscreen. It improves reading experience in several ways.

"2.0 out of 5 stars,""Not being a native English speaker, I appreciated a lot the dictionary functionality in my older non-touchscreen Kindle. In the Touchscreen version, however, the re-designed dictionary functionality is much less useful for a number of reasons:Some dictionary articles for derived words are just referring to the main word. For example: the article for """"beheld"""" has only this text: """"beheld /bi ' held/ past and past participle of BEHOLD"""". Now good luck navigating from here to the """"behold"""" article. In the old kindle the dictionary was displayed the same way the book is displayed, with full support for looking up the words in the dictionary, and additionally, the reference to the main dictionary article was actually a hyperlink, and you could just move cursor there and navigate to the """"BEHOLD"""" article. In the new dictionary design it is impossible, none of the words in the dictionary popup window is clickable. Some articles are quite strange, for example, the article for """"mine"""" has 5 meanings, among which, in addition to """"belonging to me"""" and """"mine as in mining"""", there is a list of things like """"9th letter of the alphabet"""" - so it seems that the dictionary mixes together related word's homonyms (mine is form of """"I"""", let's show the other meanings of the word """"I""""), which does not make much sense if not confusing."",the re-designed dictionary functionality is much less useful for a number of reasons";;;;;;
"4.0 out of 5 stars,""Although I had the first Kindle for at least 5 years, I am trying to give this one a fair trial.  One way that I can't become accustomed to is the way of changing pages.  This Kindle requires the little pen,type thing and even then it is sometimes stubborn.  Another way I find to take some changing, is the way the books are displayed with the book covers.  Since my eyesight is not strong, I liked the titles to be displayed in print.  As it is, I may be required to get a page enlarger/microscope.  Did the developers think of visually impaired people who are trying to read the titles in the contents?  Otherwise, this kindle is acceptable."",Change for the visually impaired could be really good";;;;;;
"3.0 out of 5 stars,""Full disclosure-- I previously owned a Kindle Fire HD (that died very suddenly, and inexplicably after 2 years of gentle use), so my opinions on the Kindle Touch is after having owned a fancier model of Kindle.Over all, this is a good little e-reader. It does the job. It's small enough for me to hold & operate one handed (and I have small/medium sized lady hands). The font adjustment options make it easy to find something readable for your own eyes, and the paperwhite screen is wonderful. It's so nice to be able to read outside on a sunny day without glare making it impossible to see the words!! I love how light this little thing is, how portable, and how easy & straight forward to use.My biggest complaint is with the lag in doing... well... anything. Pages do not seamlessly turn, it takes a second or two to utilize the X-ray or dictionary features, etc. It's not a deal breaker, but having come from the Kindle Fire HD it's definitely something that I notice and am mildly irritated by. Also, I sort of hate that it's only black & white. Buying books, and seeing the full-colour covers in my 'library' is something that I miss.In general, this is just a MUCH more basic reading experience than what I experienced with the Fire HD. However, that is to be expected as the price is essentially 1/3 of what the Fire HD cost. Some trade off is to be expected, I suppose. I will say that having a more inexpensive e-reader (though lacking in some bells & whistles that I had grown accustomed to) is nice because I feel less worried about """"being careful"""" with it, and babying it. There is a bit more freedom to be found with a device that doesn't cost hundreds of dollars.Over all, I would recommend this e-reader to someone who really just needs a BASIC e-reader that they can take on the bus, traveling, etc. It's portable, it's readable, and it very much does the job. However, if having something fancy & shiny is important to you, you may want to consider one of the Fire series readers."",""Good, but basic!""";;;;;;

The only accessories that fit this Kindle are covers.  (My old Kindle had a rubber case -- like a skin -- that protected it while also making it easy to read with one hand. If I want to hold a thing with a cover, I can read a book.)  But the worst part is the touch screen.  It seems like it turns the page if you breathe on it.  If you brush it with your sleeve you can wind up in the next chapter.  Be careful when you pick it up or it will change the font.  Ridiculous.

Let me start off by saying that I read books from the library.  And generally I read hardcovers because the fonts are larger and there is ample vertical spacing.  Paperbacks often have tiny fonts and the lines of text have no vertical spacing and I find it difficult to read.  I read free/library books on the Kindle as I do not purchase books.The internet speed on this device is horribly slow.  Wait, wait, wait.  It loses a star for that.I like that I can select text font and size.  The screen is not white bright so reading at night does not blast my eyes with blue light.

The UI is easy to use and it's mostly very good.What I don't like about it....

All of my experiences written in this review reflect that these are the only 2 readers I've used.I really like the new OS and I think the features of the 7th Generation are far better than the old Kindle Keyboard. Here are a few things I like.- As with previous versions, you can add several dictionaries. But with this one you can change dictionaries on the fly. You touch and hold a word to pop up the dictionary. Then, in the same view, you can change dictionaries. This is very helpful when you have a standard dictionary (or two or three), a Bible dictionary, and something like a tech or medical dictionary. You can easily see what each dictionary says about that word.- On the same pop up as the dictionary is a Wikipedia tab that allows you to see a brief description of what Wikipedia says about that word. That's very helpful especially if none of your dictionaries has a definition for the word.- You can quickly and easily see what books or documents you have on the device vs in the Amazon cloud, and you can easily move items back and forth.- Tapping the Go To tab while in a book allows you to see the various chapters and other divisions that may be built into the book. And, as before, you can go to a particular page, location, etc.- You can """"thumb thru"""" the pages of the book without leaving the page you're on. This is useful if you want to reference something on another page while reading.One thing I don't like is that Active Content cannot be installed on the Kindle 7th Gen. I was very disappointed when I found that out. On my Kindle Keyboard, you can add Active Content like games, address books, notepads, etc. I had a Notepad app on the Kindle Keyboard that I used every day. It contained lists of books that I wanted to read, and other things of that sort. It was very useful to me to have that on the same device that I mainly use to read.Overall, I would recommend this reader unless Active Content is a must for you."",""Lots I like, One thing I don't like""";;;;;

I still prefer physical books for researching, but maybe there is an adjustment period for me. The kindle is always at a good angle, is light weight and the screen is great on my eyes! I have had an astigmatism for most of my life and reading has always caused headaches, so enjoying reading is something I never experienced until having the Kindle. I got this Kindle as a test to see if it would be a good gift for my daughter for Christmas, and we also purchased the paperwhite to see the difference. I, myself, like the basic kindle better than the paperwhite because of the balance to it's weight overall and the screen. However, I decided that I would give my daughter the paperwhite for Christmas this year since she can read things with the light whereas I have a difficulty with lights. My daughter likes to read in bed at night with just a night light and the paperwhite will be perfect for that.

5.0 out of 5 stars,Received on time and was as advertised.  I am pleased with my purchase.  After finally using this Kindle I feel it deserves more than my original 2 sentence review.  I do not like to write reviews but I am so happy with this purchase I wanted to encourage people to consider this item.  I owned the $69 Kindle.  It was my first Kindle and I loved it.  I hesitated buying this one because I felt how different could it be from what I already had.  Well I was wrong.  This was a definite upgrade for me.  I love the touch screen.  I only use my Kindle for reading books and this one makes me feel like I am reading a book.  It is fast and easy to handle.  The price is very reasonable.  You are definitely getting your money's worth.  I spent weeks deliberating should I or shouldn't I and I'm glad I finally said I should.,I am pleased with my purchase;;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I love it!! I've been a Kindle convert for years and when my last one finally gave out on me I switched over to using my iPad and iPhone in its stay.  After a few months I noticed my eyes straining to read at times and dryness in them I'd never experienced before.  Turns out I was spending too much time staring at a computer at work only to go home and stare a bright screen all night.  The price, as always, is perfect - and I've had zero eye issues since.I love the smaller design and the lightweight feel - so easy to throw into even the smallest bag for a day so I always have my library at my fingertips."",""Happy, As Always""";;;;;;

"4.0 out of 5 stars,""I like this kindle. Obviously this is not the backlit version, so don't expect to read it in the dark. Connected to Wifi on first try and loaded my e-books onto it with no issues. Touch screen is fine for me, not too sensitive. I bought the ad-version since it was cheaper, no issues for me. When ads are on the screen, I'm not using the Kindle so it doesn't affect me. I got this on sale for $49, so it was a steal :)Minus 1 star for the plastic backing, which makes it very slippery to hold. I don't plan to buy a case, so this was a negative for me.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""Love it!  Very glad I got this version, without the screen light (and without the ads).  I deliberated long and hard comparing this model with the Paperwhite, the Kindle Fire, Nexus, Kobo, Nook, Samsung, etc.  I previously had a 2010 Nook and then later, a 2012 Nexus 7. Comparing the two dedicated e-readers, I like this way better than the Nook.  Battery is far superior, page-turning is better and it's considerably lighter.

But it sure is lightweight, very easy on the eyes, the page-turning function is easy and reliable, and the battery is superb. I'm retired, with plenty of time to devote to reading now that it's winter, and this first week I read an average of 8 - 10 hours a day, and the battery still lasted me OVER A WEEK.  Really looking forward to taking this on our upcoming cruise, where cell phones don't work and  internet time on the ship costs $42/hour, so this handy device is bound to save me from boredom --because I don't plan to be online much at those prices!  If you just want something for reading books, don't want to spend a fortune and don't want to have to even THINK about your battery, this is the one to get!  By the way, I signed up for Kindle Unlimited at $9.99/month, and I'm absolutely loving it.  It's totally worth it, and it's such a pleasure to """"buy"""" with one click and have it magically appear on my Kindle within less than 30 seconds.

4.0 out of 5 stars,I liked my old kindle for reading periodicals and books.  It was not a touch screen and was much easier to navigate than this newer version  with the touch screen.  The screen is as easy to read outdoors and its compact size makes it easy to pack and travel.  My major complaint is that the touch screen is very sensitive causing it to double skip pages and doesn't respond to reversing the error.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I've had my new Kindle for a few weeks now, and I LOVE it.I had the 5th generation before, with the side buttons and the ones on the front. It wasn't dying, but I wanted an upgrade and I was able to give my old one to my kid sister so that she could travel with a library in her bag.The only issue I have with the touch-screen Kindle is that it seems to be almost TOO sensitive. I vape, and anytime my """"smoke"""" hits the screen, the font size changes. I have no idea why this is, but it happens. The other thing is that anytime I set the Kindle down on a metal surface--like the side of my stove, or the metal wastebasket in my bathroom--it goes into standby mode.Honestly, I find these issues more amusing than anything, so I'm not too bothered by it overall.I am REALLY, REALLY happy with the Goodreads link system and the timer that lets you know how much longer you should expect to be on a chapter or the book entirely. Now when I'm reading a really good book and glance at the clock to calculate how much sleep I'll have before work, I can do it within a smaller margin of error. It helps with my neurosis.Overal, I'm loving this. I would recommend it to everyone. The glare-free screen is perfect. I couldn't do any of the back-lit screens because of my sensitive eyes, and this is a great way to keep my headaches in check and enjoy my favorite books in a light, user-friendly device."",I have an overly sensitive Kindle.";;;;;;

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""This entry level e-reader has a lot offer for Its low price. It has great response time when flipping pages and displays text in high resolution. Due to its use of e-ink, it acts and looks just like a paper book and does not bother one's eyes like traditional LCD displays would. I would recomend this e-reader to anyone who is an avid reader that is looking to transition to e-books.On a semi-unrelated note, I had noticed that there were some reviews on this item that gave it only 1 star. 1 star, not because the device was D.O.A., not charging, not loading books, or freezing. No, they gave it 1 star because: (A) it wasn't backlit, (B) it didn't have page buttons on the side like previous models, or (C) didn't come with directions/wifi.Since some people on here are too incompetent to read a device description about an E-READER, I will list some points to save you money and future regret:1. IT'S NOT BACKLIT!!!!!!!! No where in the description does it say that it's backlit!!!!!! If you want a backlit kindle, you should have purchased the PAPERWHITE OR VOYAGER!2. IT'S A TOUCH SCREEN!!!!! You don't even have to read the description to understand that! The preety product pictures clearly show no page buttons.  The only button on the device is the power button!3. THE DIRECTIONS ARE IN THE KINDLE!!!!!! There are two manuels (books) pre-installed for you that tell you everthing that you would want to know about your kindle. The one labeled """"set-up"""" will guid you through the process of setting up your kindle.4. If you don't understand how to setup your kindle, have someone who is tech-savvy do it for you.5.

It's extremely light, even lighter than my phone, the screen is great, it really does feel like reading a paper book, and the battery has grew endurance, about 2 weeks on a half charge out of the box. I think I bought this at a perfect time, I get a device with a touch screen and decent resolution for a great price while the old Kindle only had physical buttons or you had to get the more expensive model with a touch screen. The only downsides to the device are the lack of a backlight and the recessed screen tends to gather dust in the seams between the screen and the casing.

Very frustrating when I have hundreds of books & samples downloaded on each.  Getting support for Nook is FRUSTRATING.  Very hard to communicate with overseas reps.  I was reluctant to change because of my extensive Nook library, but since I buy everything else on Amazon, this move made sense.  I LOVE MY NEW KINDLE!  It costs less than Nooks, is lighter, holds a charge for over a week, and has some cool features that I like.  Most importantly, you get more extensive definitions when looking up words, and they are then added to your own list of vocabulary words.  Dorky, but fun to look back over and see if I remember what the words I've already looked up mean.  I also enjoy the """"X-ray"""" feature. I've compared a couple of ebook prices and they are cheaper through Amazon (than on Barnes &Noble). I was annoyed that Amazon charges for an ad-free version, so I bought the one with ads.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""Even with the most basic model, Amazon still makes a worthwhile e-reader.  Granted, I bought Kindle Fire HD 6 to be shared with the family, its been passed around so much that by the time it get passed along to me, I don't have much time to read.  I knew it was going to happen eventually, so when it sooner than I expected I settled on a refurbished Kindle Touch.  In this case, """"settling"""" turnout to be one the best decisions I made in while.The refurbished Kindle Touch is almost indistinguishable from its """"new"""" predecessors except sometime during lifetime it was returned to Amazon for some reason.  The device itself the most basic of e-reader offered by Amazon primarily to get you to buy e-books from their online store but can also be used read e-books borrowed from public libraries and carry around compatible personal documents, pending you don't mind the monochrome presentation.  Resembling a small tablet computer (in alot of respects, it is), an e-reader distinguishes itself from tablets with a monochrome """"electronic ink"""" screen that does not refresh itself like other LCD screens and has a lower power consumption rate that can make the battery last for days, weeks between recharges.  This is a dedicated e-reader - there are no apps that can be installed and no speaker or headphone jack to listen to *.mp3s or audiobooks - perhaps more importantly, this model is not a Paperwhite and you must have your external light source to read in low-light situations.As good as it is, there is one major fault that I discovered the hard way.  While Amazon elaborates in alot of official documentation about personal documents and cloud storage, a rather perverse semantics come into play - access to the cloud library is NOT the same as Amazon's Cloud drive.  In other words, if you have personal files stored on Amazon's cloud drive they will not be accessible from this version of the Kindle.  In order to read your personal documents from the Kindle, you must either send them via e-mail or copy them via USB.  As a corollary, by plugging in this Kindle to your computer, it's identified as mass storage device so managing it is not much different from a USB flash drive.If you can keep the above in mind, I think you can really make for you.  I bought the refurbished Kindle primarily to save every cent I could and what I get out of it more than makes up for its limits - you can buy inexpensive generic clip-on spotlight for low-light reading and if all you do to read, the Kindle is more than suited to the task with the durability and ease of use you can only get at these prices.

"4.0 out of 5 stars,""I bought my mother a Kindle but I resisted buying one for myself for a long time because I like to read eBooks on my iPhone or iPad. However, Amazon offered a deal for Prime members which made this Kindle only $50. I thought it over and decided for that price, it would be nice to be able to read in direct sunlight and not have to worry about running down my battery after a couple of hours of reading, as it does on my iPhone. The Kindle I had bought for my mom was one with a keyboard and side click-buttons. I wasn't that keen on having that type of awkward navigation, but this particular model is a """"touch"""" Kindle. When it arrived, I was very pleasantly surprised that it wasn't too different from using my iPhone for navigation (in that you touch the screen to do this or that). I did have to go look at some tutorials online to get the hang of it, but it is fairly simple to use now that I know where to touch the screen for the Home page or forward and back pages. I like the size and weight. It is about like reading a paperback book, maybe even a little lighter. I can almost hold it in one hand and use a finger to turn the pages on the same hand, although it isn't as easy as with the iPhone for that.There are only a couple of things that I find annoying. The on/off button is on the bottom edge of the frame. I tend to hold a book (or Kindle) on the sides or bottom and I have accidentally turned it off while reading because my finger touched the on/off button. The on/off button would be better if it was at the top rather than the bottom. The other thing is that I can't seem to bookmark more than one page at a time. I am in the middle of a project of converting to eBooks more than 50 stories and novels from a series that is long out of print. These stories have been scanned and turned into editable text and proofed mostly on my computer, but I still find typos while reading on the Kindle. I want to be able to put a bookmark on each page that I find a typo on, so I can go to my computer later and fix them all at one time. I think I am supposed to be able to bookmark more than one page, but these eBooks I have converted myself don't seem to let me do that. If anyone knows what I am doing wrong there, let me know."",It is great for reading outside in the hammock";;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""There is not really much I can add to the reviews here. The Kindle does exactly what I expected. It is a simple ereader without bells and whistles, which is just what I wanted. Setting it up was easy. One feature I love is that if you are reading a series, it recommends the next one in line. Even with my arthritis, I find it easy to hold. Page turning is as simple as swiping the screen or giving it a light touch. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a basic ereader.This is my first Kindle, although I've been an ebook reader for years. My other ereaders have all been from that huge brick-and-mortar US chain with the green logo. I have no regrets about my investment in hardware or books from there, but I do regret not getting a Kindle sooner.I got my Kindle through a rewards program at work. It came with """"Special Offers,"""" but it was worth it to me to pay the $20 to get rid of the ads. They did not intrude on reading in the slightest. I just didn't want to see them. So, if you do get the one with the ads, you can always go back and pay the difference to get them removed."",""No bells and whistles, just a good ereader""";;;;;;
"4.0 out of 5 stars,""I actually like this Kindle very much.  It is easy to read and the battery lasts forever before needing a charge.My problem is not with the Kindle but with Amazon book store.  It is far too easy to accidentally press a button and """"buy"""" a book without it asking for confirmation, etc.  I realize that Amazon subsidizes the price of the Kindle but there needs to be a way to require a confirmation to keep from buying a book by accident.  In the end I was able to get a credit but you need to be really careful flipping pages looking at available books."",Good product but be careful.";;;;;;
"4.0 out of 5 stars,""I been reading a kindle from about second generation and I love these devices. I stare at back lit devices all day at work so the last thing I want to is read off of one at night. The screen is very easy on the eyes and I can read for hours no problem. My only complaints is that some features are lost in the latest generation of my Kindle.

"2.0 out of 5 stars,""It was great for a year. Now it will not load new books. It took 2 hours of online chat to get it to reload the books that I previously bought. I am giving 2 stars because I loved it when it worked, and after working with that amazing chat person,now I can read the prior purchases. But what's the deal with being able to purchase but not download new books? The Kindle has NOT been dropped or in any way abused. It won't hold internet connection, flips back and forth between queued and loading maybe 25-35% of a book. At the same time, the kindle app on iPhone and iPad is totally broken--books were wiped off the devices and cannot be downloaded. I have spent maybe only an hour on calls for this problem, and have gotten nowhere. The chat person said it was not something she could fix. Tech people have not called back as they promised, perhaps because I live overseas. I have done every possible reset, so don't tell me to do that. I have done so multiple times.Follow up months later: After the recent hardware upgrade, I had hopes. A few books downloaded as they should! Now it is back to having to download to computer and then drag to the Kindle. Even the download usually takes 2-3 tries before it is successful. It used to be easy. Now it is not. It is still handy once you get the books on it."",Beware: Only good for one year. Even the app doesn't work consistently anymore.";;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I resisted eBook reading for years.  I didn't think I would like it and I was positive I would miss the tactile feeling of holding a book.  I am, by nature, a person who loves tradition, and there's a big part of me that doesn't want to see the loss of physical media for our entertainment.  The look, feel, and even smell of those physical objects is part of the experience.  Then I decided to try one.  My fingers were having a reaction to book paper and it was worth a shot.I took my Kindle on vacation and I love it!  Put a cover/case on it and it still feels nice.  The display is amazing and worked perfectly for comfortable reading under dim light, bright sunlight, and even a reading light at night.  I loved being able to zoom the text size in and out so that I could make it whatever was comfortable to read at the distance I wanted (or needed) to hold the Kindle away from me.  I also liked the weight";" it light, but it's substantial enough that I didn't feel as if I were  carrying a toy.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""It is perfect for what it is...an E READER!  Sharp clear adjustable fonts, easy to use and featherweight light.  With this device you can have a large number of books at your fingertips.  What every purchaser should know, is that this IS NOT A TABLET and Amazon has never marketed or promoted it as one.  This is a Generation 7 Kindle, it IS NOT a backlit display so you will have to read it in a place with adequate ambient light (just like reading a book) or buy a little clip on reading lamp.  If you are looking for the backlit version you need to buy the Kindle Paperwhite.  Buying new books from the Amazon store is a snap once you have your account set up.  I had an existing account so I simply had to log in.  It is also possible to download kindle format ebooks through your local library (limit 5 at a time) through overdrive.com but you must have a library card and set up a password of your choosing.  Finding and downloading books from the kindle IS NOT the way to go.  It is possible but the kindle browser is slow and difficult to read.  It is far easier to connect the Kindle to your PC and download the Kindle ebook through overdrive.  Overdrive sends it to your Amazon account online.  You just go to your Amazon Bookshelf online and download through your PC to the Kindle.  I bought mine through Amazon, on sale for $49.99.  With my Amazon Credit Visa accrued points I ended up coming out of pocket about $20.00.  I couldn't be happier so far. I hope you will find this review helpful."",Perfect For What it is";;;;;;
"1.0 out of 5 stars,""i loved the original Kindle. This one I hate. You barely touch screen and dictionary or other stuff pops up. Page doesn't always switch, very picky. wish I had my old one back. You can't play games on it either. Missing my Solitaire. GRRRR Don't get this one!!!!"",i loved the original Kindle";;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I bought this kindle for 2 reasons.  1.  It was on sale for $29 and 2. The size.  You can’t beat the price and it was a real steal for $29.  I own the original kindle with the keyboard and a kindle fire and absolutely love this one as a backup for days when I want something portable and lightweight for reading only.I agree with other posters that this kindle is not for you if you want the following:  a light, external buttons or anything other than a reading device.  THIS DEVICE DOES NOT HAVE A LIGHT!!!  I bought mine with the clear understanding that if I wanted a light, I would have to buy a kindle paperwhite so please don’t be confused.  Personally, it has a better display than my original kindle with the keyboard which looked almost gray and not as bright as this one.  It is pleasant to use this kindle in regular light and there is no glare.  The display is crisp and clean.There are no external buttons except the power button and everything else is touch screen which is what I like.  My only comment is the fact that sometimes there is a tiny microsecond of lag when turning pages but nothing to get upset about.  For the price I paid, I’m not complaining.Finally, the thing I like most about this handy little device is the size and portability.  I positioned it next to my iPhone 6 and it is a few inches larger in both directions but not much.  The display is generous and it feels good in my hands while holding it.  I did purchase a case since I didn’t want it to get scratched up but overall, well worth the money.  I find myself going for this one before the kindle fire when I don’t want to carry the extra weight in my purse.Also, (and I think this goes back to comments from when the kindle was first released) the device comes with a micro-usb charging cable but not a wall plug but if you’re like me, you’ve got 2 or 3 wall plugs already from other devices so no worries there either."",I love it!";;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I'm in love.  I've figured out why they call it a KINDLE because it truly rekindled my love for reading.  Its easy on my eyes, unlike my ipad, and simple to throw in my purse, unlike a book.  I am also one of the ADD readers, where I like to read a couple diff genres of book at once.  For example, I'm reading YOU: the owners manual, Lena Dunhams book, a scary thriller and some stupid little fiction I got for free from Amazon.  I would look like a crazy person carrying 4 books around with me, but with my kindle I can.  I really am in love.  Its perfect."",reKINDLED spirit";;;;;;

"3.0 out of 5 stars,""The ability to read the text is about the same as my first Kindle, which I still have. But, all the effort to make it more jazzy has resulted in it being harder to navigate. On my keyboard Kindle the books I have active in my library are listed in text. One look and I can see 10 of the books I have that I intend to read.Flip to thr next page and I can see 10 more. All I have to do to call one up is to highlight it and push the OK button. When I'm done and want to archive the boo,k that is easliy done and it no longer appears in the list. If I want to recall an archived book all I have to do is go to the archive listing and recall it. Simple, straightforward. To find a book with the touchscreen display I have to navigate through many books, depicted as book-covers, to find the book I want. If you have a number of books in the queue, that is time consuming and frustrating.  And, I can find no easy way to recall a book that has been deleted from the bookshelf. Snazzy graphics but a lot more work. On the plus side, the battery lasts longer. In the end, I like my keyboard Kindle better."",Not an improvement to the user.";;;;;;
"4.0 out of 5 stars,""Amazon got it right this time! The fonts are crisp, and the page turning is very responsive, not sluggish like the PWs. I just wish they would bring back text-to-speech in an e-ink model again. I know the Fires have them, and I still have an old Touch and KK lying around, but it seems they've abadoned it on newer models. Other than that, it's lovely. Apparently even the high-priced Voyage doesn't have it either.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""This was my original review:Amazon has sent me a Kindle in which all text is in Russian. I called the help desk and a very patient  tech and an increasingly impatient me tried to figure out how to reset this device so that I could use it, unfortunately neither of us speak this language, and the device itself seemed to have a lot of inactive options. It has occurred to me that this device was originally used by a Russian person who sent it back, and that Amazon then sent it to me as 'new'. This Kindle probably didn't work for that Russian guy either, which is why he got rid of it.Then,I called Amazon the same day that I received the above item and they sent out a replacement the next day.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I had to replace my Kindle paperwhite from years ago because it really just died from me using it ALL the time.  I absolutely loved it and because of the Kindle, I enjoyed reading again.  This version is not that different except the fact that it is smaller in size (which is a positive), there is no keyboard on the front and it has improved technology as far as speed and response is concerned.  I am a paper white lover because I can read it inside or on a beach without any glare or restrictions to content.  You can control the font size and spacing which makes it very versatile for readers of any age.  Buying content from Amazon and having it 'whisper' to my device is pure love.  Kindle seriously makes reading on the go fun and simple.  You connect it using your WiFi and you are good to go.  One time connection and you are set.  If you are looking for night reading, you will need to purchase a light attachment as this Kindle does not have a nightlight of any kind.It comes packaged like any other Kindle: stabilized and safe, easy to open, and battery life to get you started.  I actually used my Kindle for weeks on the battery life provided initially.  Talk about unwrap and go!  I did get the one with 'ads' but those do not bother me as my original Kindle had the same thing.  I purchased this for a great price during the Amazon Prime Day and I am loving every second of it.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I started with the Kindle Fire and got this second. It's much nicer reading books on this unit!It is lighter. You'll irritate your hands/wrist holding the Fire steady for hours at a time.It doesn't overhead. The fire overheats if you use it for graphics heavy stuff. If you put it in a case so it stays propped up, you can overheat until the unit shuts down.It's smaller than the Fire. Easier for me to grab the unit. MUCH lower risk of dropping it.It's got a glare free screen. Read outdoors in daylight again. Read at night with a reading light the traditional way.No blue light in your eyes at night. I confess. It was affecting me and I refused to believe i was getting insomnia until I switched.Less distracting. The browser is b&w and awkward to use. There are no apps. Finally finish reading those books!Page speed is good. Paging backward is touchy.You touch the top of the screen to call up the controls. This is good. It's less awkward than the Fire where you touched the middle.Reasonable selection of fonts and sizes.Wish listThe black print on gray background isn't high contrast. The better the light, the easier to read. - i wish I'd ordered a paperwhite or I had a decent reading lightBattery life - Unlike the Fire, this battery really hangs onto its charge if unused. It's fine on it's own for a week. Under heavy use (6+ hours/day) you will want to recharge every third day. Just long enough to forget to charge. You can't read and charge if the battery is completely drainedThe width of the plastic edge next to  the screen is just wide enough to make touching the screen for the page turn a bit of a hop for your finger.The library is presented as a list which you can sort by title, author, recent, etc... This isn't all that helpful. The larger your collection, the more you need the book cover to help your memory. You need to open the book to see the cover. A thumbnail would be so useful.The Kindle doesn't always break lines at the most aesthetically pleasing breakpoint. You may be left with half the line empty while the rest of the page is filled.  This is obvious at the larger fonts.The usb cord used for recharging is pretty short. It is difficult to reach most outlets while reading. Charging from a computer is slow.I recommend Calibre (shareware) if you want to read files on your device. Calibre will convert the file to kindle-compatible format and load it onto the machine.So much lighter and less distracting than the Fire. I've left the fire at home for a month now and I don't miss it.Let's face it. I use the fire for playing games now."",This one is for reading.";;;;;;

"1.0 out of 5 stars,""I am very, very dissatisfied with this.I purchased it because my faithful no-frills Kindle's page-turning button finally wore out. It has been nothing but trouble since day one.The touch screen is capricious, alternating between overly sensitive and unresponsive.  There are days when it seems like I'm spending more time resetting the text size than I am reading because when I touch to turn the page, the font-size adjust bar comes up instead of the next page. For example, a little while ago I was reading and had to fix the font 14 times over 2 page turns.I really dislike the current layout--it used to be that I could put my items into collections and if I was in collection view,  I could not only see the list of collections but also items that weren't yet in a collection.  Now the only way to see uncategorized items is to put it into the """"all"""" view, and the area button is so small that it often takes 10-20 tries to change the view!I hated it from the moment it arrived, and I am so, so sorry I let customer service talk me into keeping it--I would have done better to spend the money to repair the old kindle."",Very unhappy with this product";;;;;;

I am very satisfied with this ereader.At first i thought it is going to some cheap plastic uesd on this model, because it looks bad on the picture. However, it neither feels or looks cheap at all. It is very solid and comfortable to hold. And the back does not collect your finger print at all. Personly, I think this is much better than the Kindle Voyage. You don't need a cover for this reader. It gives you a solid feeling that it won't break, and even if it breaks, you can get another one for $79. Unlike the kindle Voyage, which i have to treat carefully because of the piano part can easily get scratched. When you put the Kindle Voyage in a cover, it is going to be heavier than this basic verision.The screen looks amazing. I can't tell the difference between this one and the kindle voyage.

"4.0 out of 5 stars,""I'm not a huge fan of touchscreen devices, though this one has its pluses and minuses.On the Positive Side: it's easy to put items into collections - I wish I could drag/drop items, but being able to click check boxes and easily type is a positive. The ability to select different font types and sizes is nice, and you can easily add bookmarks. My kindle just updated within the past few days and added the """"Bookerly"""" font, which is Amazon's font specifically designed for kindle. It's nice, but I prefer Palatino out of the options available, so I stuck with what I already liked. The price is good, and it can hold a LOT of books. The screen is also easy to read, even outside in bright light.On the Negative Side: The touchscreen is really sensitive. If I bump the kindle, all of the sudden my font is huge, and then I have to make it smaller again. Or I'll find myself on another page. I appreciate the ease on turning pages, but constantly having to readjust my font every time my cat decides to bump the kindle, or if I put it facedown on my lap for a moment, is really frustrating. There also isn't a built in light on this model, so you need to get a booklight or make sure that you have adequate light to read with.Overall, it's a good kindle, but I miss my buttons...

"4.0 out of 5 stars,""This is my first Kindle.  Although I have had computers since the mid-'80s, as well as ipods and iphones, I always liked to read books with real paper - I liked the feel of them, to look back at earlier passages at times, in short, to read real books, not online books.  However, I have accumulated too many books, and I've run out of space.  I even developed an allergy to old book dust.  So my dilemma was this:  I joined a book club, and we read some very interesting books, but the last thing I need is more books.  Given all that, I decided to try Kindle.  The glare-free screen seemed like a good idea, since my eyes get tired from too much time on the computer, and I particularly liked not having to charge yet another device daily, so the two+ week battery life time sounded promising.  Both of these features were a good idea, and the price wasn't bad, either.Update:  Some pros and cons that weren't initially apparent:  The screen is a little darker than I had expected (not as bright as a new paperback), but still is very readable.  Free books weren't as available as I had hoped.  I signed up for Kindle Unlimited, but found that none of the book club books were on it.  I then got a library card, and discovered downloads - the first book was found, and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it on Kindle - it made it easy to read just a bit at a time, if I didn't have much time.  Kindle plus an Amazon recommended cover were a bit heavy to hold up in bed, which sometimes affected my wrist/fingers, but I still found it interesting to read in this way.  The next book, however, was much more difficult to access.  It was not on Kindle Unlimited (or the lending library), and although it was in my home library as a download, this kind of Kindle can't read the download -- only Kindle Fire can read it - an Amazon issue  that I wish they would resolve!  I finally went through a lot of trouble and registered for a 3M Cloud account, and was able to download the book to my desktop computer (same issue with Kindle Fire being OK but not this Kindle - but that's no way to read a book!  If I had owned an iPad, that would have worked, but for now, my Kindle is idle.  To be continued."",""I mostly like it, but I'm not abandoning books yet!""";;;;;;
"4.0 out of 5 stars,""I had an older Kindle with a keypad and buttons and I was curious to try out a newer model.  I figured that one could go with me on trips and the other could stay at home.The new charging cord is an annoyance - I much prefer the old (white), long Kindle cord"; I could charge the Kindle while reading in bed. Not so with the much shorter (black) cord.  It's not a big deal, but an annoyance.This Kindle works fine and does what it says - I don't see much of a difference from my keyboard version.  The page turning is pretty handy, although it took a while to make it work all the time.  That's not a Kindle problem; that's my problem.One thing that I find very, very annoying is the incredible sensitivity of the screen;" I have had Kleenex tissue hit the screen, and change the page, or, more usually, change the fonts.  I've fallen asleep while reading, and the Kindle hitting the mattress or a blanket hitting the page will bring up a dictionary, or change the fonts or activate something.  I'm used to this behavior, but it is pretty annoying.The only other problem I had was getting my books installed on the Kindle from the Amazon Cloud.  On the old Kindle, everything was sorted into collections, but when I attempted to bring things down on the new Kindle, it was all messed up and confused. This is probably the most serious issue I ran into, but some patient work has things sorted out."",""Good, but some minor issues""";;;

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""If you haven't used a Kindle before, let me tell you: This device is going to feel weird. It really does look like a paperback book, with the slightly-off-white display. If you're expecting it to look like a tablet, well, it doesn't exactly. No, this device looks like a book - but with electronic programming that allows it to actually be hundreds or even thousands of books.This Kindle was my Christmas present to myself, and I am delighted. I had low expectations as it is a budget device - if you want something with more features, you're going to have to shell out more money. But if you're looking for an inexpensive way to collect books and carry them all in a single pocket, this will get the job done.Edit, for more information:I've been using my Kindle for 16 days now - and still have yet to charge it. For this reason alone, I see it as a valuable investment. It's an electronic, but it's not something I'm going to have to remember to charge.

"4.0 out of 5 stars,""As an avid lifelong reader of books, I wasn’t sure I’d like the Kindle and was unwilling to invest much. I bought this one during the Black Friday sale for $49.99, a price that finally convinced me to try it. What I like: The light weight and compact size are perfect, and it fits easily into a pocket of my handbag for travel. Page-turning is simple, and the screen is very easy on the eyes in decent lighting. As a senior, I love love love being able to adjust the font size!! The charge lasts a long time, and it recharges quickly using my computer’s USB port. Buying books on Amazon is very easy.What I’m still getting used to: The edges around the screen are narrow except at the bottom, and I haven’t yet found a way to hold the Kindle comfortably for long periods. I’ve come close to dropping it several times, especially if I doze off while reading. It would be nice to have a stretchy fabric strap on the back to slip my hand through. I’m not used to touch screens (don’t care for them), and the Kindle’s is very sensitive, so I tend to accidentally activate features I don’t want, enter multiples of letters while searching, or send myself to mysterious locations in the book and have to find my way back. I don’t use social media or other sharing features. All I do is buy and read, so all in all, it’s an excellent value for a new user.

This goes just about everywhere with me and it has encouraged me to read more as I'd slacked off more than I was happy with. As a starter, I can tolerate the ads (for now) but my dream is to upgrade to a more substantial model that will allow me to do and see more.I was taken aback at first because, unbeknownst to me, the feature that shows you what other readers have highlighted was enabled, but I poked around some and saw how to turn that bad boy off. It was mildly interesting at first (Hmm... why would someone highlight THAT passage or line?) but quickly grew distracting/annoying. Still in all, I've been very pleased with the experience and have fun loading my Kindle up with all kinds of reading material that I wouldn't otherwise have taken a second look at in a hard copy.  I've also loved the readability of the test and the ability to make the font comfortable for my eyes. Until an upgrade is possible for me (soon pleasepleaseplease!) I will add a clip-on light so that I can read in dimmer light as well.So, if anyone else is still holding out on taking the technological jump into an e-reader, I say go for it! I still miss the smell of a new book at times but I can always go browse in the local mega book emporium.(Oh, and thanks to those who posted in their reviews about trying my phone charger before springing for a separate charger purchase <really Amazon?> because my Android charger works like a charm.)"",I Took the Plunge...Finally!";;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""My daughter is in college and is studying for the GRE. She was going to get the 5 lb GRE study guide (I think that that's what it's called) but hated the thought of lugging it around with her.  She had wanted a Kindle to make that easier, but has trouble sleeping and has been reading articles about how reading backlit devices at bedtime can lead to sleep issues.  This Kindle was the right item at the right time (and right price).  She'll be able to study in bed without staring at the backlit screen."",She was going to get the 5 lb GRE study guide (I think that that's what it's called) but hated the thought of lugging it around";;;;;;
5.0 out of 5 stars,I got my kindle for Christmas and I am absolutely addicted to it. I hadn't researched them before hand and my mom bought me this one so obviously I was a little shocked to see it didn't have a light because I was unfamiliar with them. However it doesn't bother me at all and I think I prefer it instead. Lighted screens make my eyes hurt after a while and I love the look of a real printed book. It is light and a little flimsy feeling but if you just get a case for it it makes it easier to hold and protects it.,Love it;;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""Have secretly wanted a Kindle for a long time.  I received one from my son for Christmas and just love it!  No glare, easy to read, great features (I love the x-ray feature especially, and looking up words).  I carry it in my bag and can read my book at any down time--waiting at the doctor's office, or anywhere.  I am really happy with it and know I'll be using it a lot!  It's great to save money, too, since almost all Kindle versions of books are less expensive."",Love it!!";;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I love my Kindle. I bought one when the price dropped below $100 back in 2011. A touch screen sounded nice, but physical buttons were OK by me. At $79, the new touch screen Kindle was definitely tempting, but I resisted until Thanksgiving when the price dropped to $49. Two days later I had my new Kindle & my husband had my old one. He's been a read paper books or read on the tablet or phone kind of guy. Two weeks later when the price dropped to $59 I asked him if he wanted Santa to get him one. After comparing the 2, he said yes. So, why this Kindle?Designed for readersPhysical books have dark print on a light background. They don't have built in lights. You sit in a spot with adequate lighting and read them. The same is true of this Kindle. Of course, sometimes it would be nice to be able to read in the dark or see the color in a book. Fortunately Kindle apps are available for almost any device and Amazon syncs across my devices. That means I can switch to using my tablet or phone when I need color or a light. For the record, I don't do that very often.Ease of UseI really didn't mind the physical buttons on my old Kindle. I also don't miss them. It's so much easier to hold the Kindle when I don't have to position my thumb on the edge of the device so I can turn the page. On the relatively rare occasions when I need to type something the keyboard on the new Kindle is incredibly easy to use. Typing on the old one was a pain in the butt. Getting a definition or highlighting a passage is a matter of touching the screen, not repeatedly pushing a button.Adjustable FontsNeed reading glasses? I do.  Sure, I can read normal sized print in physical books, but my Kindle lets me adjust the font size to make reading easier.  This isn't a new feature, but it's easier than it used to be.Battery LifeThe bad news is I don't get the projected month on a charge. The good news is the battery lasts days, not hours. Amazon bases their claim on 1/2 hour of reading per day (15 hours per month)and leaving wi-fi off. I spend an hour or 2 a day reading, so that cuts the estimated battery life at least in half. The Kindle uses battery only for page turns and accessing wi-fi. I leave wi-fi on. I also use a larger font and I read more than 1000 wpm. Google says the average person reads 250-300 wpm. The font size and reading speed mean at least 4 times the estimated page turns.  Battery life may not be what Amazon claims, but it's certainly within expected parameters. And it definitely beats battery life on my phone and tablet.Good ReadsI have't previously used Good Reads, but I do now. I love that it's integrated into this Kindle.Family libraryThis wasn't available on the old Kindle. I like sharing books with my husband. We don't have any children in residence, but the family features sound great.Buying ExperienceBooks don't have to cost money. I usually don't go into a bookstore or a library in search of a specific book. I go to a section and choose from what's available. I do the same on Amazon. I do most of my browsing in the free best sellers list. Since free books don't necessarily stay free, I buy whatever looks like I'd like it. I don't always like them and/or read them but I have more than 800 purchased books, most of them free. And all I have to take with me on the plane is my Kindle. Of course, at the bookstore I can sample the book before I buy it. Amazon lets me download a free sample. Once I buy a book, Amazon downloads it to my Kindle in about the time it takes to read this sentence. Amazing.Other book sources**Public libraries. The selection of ebooks at my library is significantly smaller than the selection of paper books. (No, ebooks don't cost the library nothing. They are actually significantly more expensive.) That said, the selection has definitely improved. Books check out for 1-3 weeks. The process is ridiculously easy. Check out the book & select Kindle. Overdrive takes you to Amazon, where the buy button has been changed to the borrow button. Don't count on finishing the last chapter after lending period ends. The book will stop functioning the second the lending period ends. The good part of that is that there are no fines for late returns.**Prime Lending Library. Check out 1 qualifying book per month with no due date. I have a wishlist of Prime books I want to read. I checked the library for them. Most weren't available,so my free sources don't overlap. This is a nice perk of Prime, but definitely not a reason to sign up. Prime books are only available on Kindle devices, not Kindle apps.**Kindle Unlimited for $9.99/month. I didn't expect to like my free trial, but I did. I could easily find and read more than $10 worth of books per month. Most (all?) of my Prime wishlist is available on Kindle Unlimited. While I like Kindle Unlimited, I have suspended my subscription for the moment. I will probably renew periodically. My husband wasn't impressed with the selection. I browse bookstores. He shops for a specific book. Kindle Unlimited is more suited to browsing.Special OffersAs previously implied, I'm cheap. That said, I did wonder about the Special Offers. Buy the Kindle with SO. Pay the $20 difference later if they bother you. You will see them as a screen saver and at the bottom 1/2 inch of the home page. You do NOT see them when you are actually reading. I don't spend much time on the home screen. I spend even less time looking at the screensaver. I spend most of my time on the Kindle actually reading. Some deals aren't bad, so I occasionally look at the list in the menu.  It's definitely not worth $20 to me to get rid of them."",Definitely an upgrade.";;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I have had a Kindle for over 4 years and used it daily almost.  I used it mostly for reading.  I find I have read over twice as many books since I first got it.  Finally, it just wore out and I purchased my current one.  I purchased it while in Seattle over Christmas vacation and have been reading steadily ever since.  I purchased the smaller one that fits better in my purse or carry-on when I travel.  I'm not one to change whatever if what I had works for me.

2.0 out of 5 stars,Prefer my older version without the touchscreen. Difficult to navigate. Cannot go back or forward easily.  It constantly highligths or tries to copy a line--basically because I have not managed to move from page to page. Despite assurances that this was a better choice because of lower price the paper white might have been better. Still cannot read unless there is sufficient light and find the correct font or size for better reading. Not the best for a replacement reader,Rather have my old reader back;;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""My wife and I have a couple of kindles, originally I wanted the kindle fire as you could also play Angry Birds on it and occasionally use the internet - but never used it much for this. The kindle fire has a battery that lasts only a day or two, the black and white kindle lasts weeks.Our son gave us for Christmas a year ago a black and white kindle where you have the backlight also.I bought this to replace the lost black and white kindle that my wife lost. After getting it, we realized that this has no backlight, that means no reading at night without a light. My wife loves to read at night and does not want to disturb me, I usually do not read at night, so I took this one and I gave her mine.Maybe it is a good recommendation to buy the more expensive model, but this works fine if you do not plan to read at night without another light source."",""Great price, easy to read""";;;;;;
5.0 out of 5 stars,LOVE it!  The first thing I love about this Kindle is the glare-free screen.  It allows me to sit in my back yard and read as the sun is high in the sky.  The battery is the second thing that is fantastic.  It lasts unbelievably long.  I read a lot and I have only charged it twice in the month that I've had it.  The size is also perfect.  I can take it in my purse and read it anywhere.I highly recommend this fabulous Kindle!!!,Highly recommended!!!;;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I and my wife are avid and prodigous readers, I had been reluctant to go from a paper based book to the electronic reader.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I have owned a Kindle in the past. I had the first version that came out. I was excited about the Fire bc it had more features. It was soo buggy that I wanted to throw it against the wall. I abandoned Kindle altogether and just used the app on my iPad. Now that I'm out of grad school and have my summers off, I wanted to revisit Kindle due to the glare factor. I also purchase a lot of books for work and need to reference them often. It is easier to purchase theses on a Kindle as opposed to having them all in hardback. THIS is the Kindle I've been waiting for!!!!Pros:- light weight- no bugs- can read in the sun but still adjust the background for the home- WONDERFUL study features:  - Dictionary: this is my favorite. Simply touch a word you don't know and it brings up the definition  - highlighting : you can go to a feature in the book that will show you every passage you have highlighted. It's the equivalent to putting post-its to mark a page but without the flipping and searching  - X-Ray: this is soo helpful when you are reading a book with a lot of characters or terms. Simple touch the character's name and it will bring up the important information on them!It has other features as well but those are my favorite. You can also organize them now which is also helpful (grouping). The battery life is also wonderful.Cons:- browser is slow. The internet feature sucks so you are better off using a smart device or computer to purchase your books.That's honestly the only con I can think of. I highly recommend this Kindle. It's one of my favorite things!"",The Kindle I've been waiting on!";;;;;;

"4.0 out of 5 stars,""I loved my fourth generation Kindle because it was pretty much a no nonsense little ereader. It was also comfortable to hold for hours of reading pleasure. Unfortunately as such things go, it finally gave up the ghost and it was time for an upgrade. Hence, the seventh generation touchscreen. It's only been a week or so, but I've settled in with this one. The touchscreen is definitely a plus, the screen is crystal clear and glare free. Of course there are a lot more bells and whistles with it, such as Goodreads integration and the quick view. There were times I found such additions a bit fussy, but they're coming around. My biggest complaint is how much more weight this ereader has compared to my first. Even with the thinnest cover I could find, it's still an adjustment. For all that, it's still a nice little machine."",Surprised by the Weight";;;;;;

I immediately went out to purchase another one and I was really happy the quality was still there with a couple new upgrades. I love the glare free screen.

"4.0 out of 5 stars,""I've been a kindle user since the original 1.0 version.  I still remember paying almost $300 for my first one.  I've averaged an upgrade probably every three models.I picked this one up more because it was on sale for AmazonPrime day than anything else. I have been using the previous version with the awkward directional button on the bottom of the screen.  I also use a Paperwhite at night if I'm reading in bed because the glow doesn't overly disturb my wife trying to sleep.For reading outside, this is a great device - I don't think you can beat it, and I don't think you need the paperwhite or voyage in order to enjoy your book.For reading inside, you lose a star.  It just has a """"dark"""" luster to it.  I find myself slightly straining my eyes to read it.And the touchscreen is good, and bad.  It is fantastic for whenever you have to type in a keyboard or click a button.  It is okay when you have to turn a page.  My issue is that sometimes I accidentally turn a page because I figit with the device while reading.  Or I want to turn the page with my left hand and can't.  More of a minor annoyance than a defect I think.  I have the same exact experience on my paperwhite, but I can't bring myself to pay the extra money for the Voyager."",""Ups and downs.

This simply takes me where I need to go for book searches (tap magnifying glass on drop down menu and type in search words.)  The keyboard on the bottom half of the screen is nice and I rarely miss a key when tapping.  Searches have been surprisingly quite fast and download speed is faster than expected even for longer books. The scroll bar was tricky at first, swiping down to go up and swiping up to go down!  Light touches to the right of screen take you forward to the next page and to the left of screen take you backward to the page before and these taps need not be hard to get the pages turned. The unlit screen doesn't hurt my eyes since it is lit by any light source outdoors or indoors.  Other features as advertised such as dictionary are useful for quick look up but again, not necessary for reading (since I personally get easily distracted and don't want to look up words all day) and I noticed two dictionaries to choose from.  Love the feature of making words (font size) as big or as small as needed or allowed by putting two fingers apart an inch or two on the screen, then pinching the two fingers to make font smaller or opening fingers wider from a pinch position on the screen, to make font larger (what a snap!)

"3.0 out of 5 stars,""I purchased the Kindle 7th Generation after the screen on my 3rd Generation failed. I was an avid reader on my Kindle 3rd generation and was quite disappointed when the screen broke. Knowing how much I enjoyed reading on my Kindle I decided i couldn't go back to regular paper books, so I got the 7th Generation is the other day and to be honest was disappointed to see many of the features are gone. If you are looking for a straight up eReader with no bells and whistles this will work for you...although I'm sure there are cheaper versions or ereaders out there. Features they have taken aways are the speakers, the Kindle will no longer read a book to you which I used to us in the car daily, also there are no games which the 3rd generation allowed you to download, there is no screen contrast, it doesn't even come with a wall charger.

It was just wonderful to hold. The back plastic on this model is VERY cheap and slick, and while I enjoy the Kindle experience overall, I don't get the joy out of holding this device like I did the previous model.

"1.0 out of 5 stars,""My one star review is solely based on Amazon's decision to include """"Special Offers"""" on their lower priced Kindle Touch (which is still, actually, not super cheap, typically running you about $80). My husband purchased the Kindle Touch for me from a retailer, and so, it automatically included what Amazon refers to as """"Special Offers"""" that Amazon claims only kindle users are privy to. At first, the special offers were limited to Amazon products only (Amazon Fire TV stick, chargers, cases, etc) and although I was pretty disappointed to learn that my screen-lock pages consisted of basically a rotation of Amazon ads, it was somewhat tolerable (although I should note that these """"Special Offers"""" were not special at all, as the price of each item displayed was actually the same exact price if not CHEAPER on Amazon's main website, which EVERYONE has access to). Occasionally, Amazon would throw a few book cover illustrations in the rotation, which was a nicer display (although it still displayed the price of the book so was technically an ad as far as I'm concerned).Then it took a turn for the worst! A few weeks later, my Kindle updated automatically, and with the update the ads became completely out of control. It was no longer limited to Amazon products but instead included ads from Asics shoes, Quaker oatmeal, Vitamin pills, ice-cream, life alert bracelets, and even blood pressure monitoring devices! And it was EVERY SINGLE TIME my Kindle was in screen-lock mode. The one book cover illustration that I did find in this new rotation even had an ad for the Land Rover in the bottom corner! When I unlocked my Kindle and went to the homepage, the same annoying ads were displayed in a banner at the bottom of the screen. Had I been able to return my Kindle, I would have (the retailer we purchased it from has a 14 day return policy). Instead, I took the route that I know Amazon hopes each person that buys the discounted Kindles will take";" I bought my way out of them for an additional $20. And no, you cannot use an Amazon gift card to pay for the ads to be removed from your Kindle, as an Amazon customer service person formally informed me. Fortunately, my Kindle was purchased at a Black Friday special price, saving us about $30 total and making this $20 ad-removal fee a little easier to swallow.That being said, as soon as I paid the fee, the ads immediately disappeared from my Kindle Touch and I am MUCH happier with it, however I am completely appalled and disappointed with Amazon for taking on such shady business practices and making an E-reader that has all of visual appeal of a lame ad-supported free phone app."",""not super cheap, typically running you about $80)""";;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I am a long time Kindle user who has owned several of the models and bought several others for my family members as gifts.  I think this little Kindle is amazing.  I owned one of the first generation models when they first came out and I loved it and used it for 3 years until I was ready to upgrade to the Kindle Fire.  I was excited about the Kindle Fire and how it was like a tablet but quickly realized I didnt like the tablet part of it or the glass screen with the glare all the time.  Plus, it was really hard to type on the keyboard and on all 3 models of the Fire, the charging port wore out.  That just happened to me again and this time I saw this model on sale for Black Friday for $49 and decided I had nothing to lose trying it out.  It arrived the next day (thanks Amazon amazing customer service!) and was very easy to set up.  It comes with only a charging cord with USB plug now and does not come with the power unit that you need to be able to plug it into an outlet.  All of my other Kindles it was included but now it is sold separately.  Once I got it charged and turned on it only took a couple minutes to set it up and I was reading!  Note: this Kindle is not backlit.  It has no light at all so you do need a light to read in the dark.  I love this Kindle.  It is much lighter than the other models and the touch screen is really nice, you dont have to push a button to turn the page.  If you are an avid reader like me, who uses their kindle mainly for reading, this is a great device."",My favorite Kindle yet!!";;;;;;
"4.0 out of 5 stars,""I'll be honest, I miss my kindle keyboard.  I miss having a manual page turn, I miss the size and shape and I miss having the music option.  The new kindle touch is lighter, the screen is the same size as the original kindle, so it is slightly smaller lengthwise, but slightly thicker.  The screen itself is definitely better.  It is whiter and reminds me less of an etch-a-sketch. It operates faster, there is no delay in page turns.  It turns on the same way as an iPhone, where you push a button and then have to swipe the screen just right.  Obviously it doesn't have a light, but I don't want a backlit reading experience.As to kindle in general, over books: I love having a kindle and never want to go back.  It reads better than a book because I can adjust the text size.  I don't have to deal with the ink rubbing off like with mass market paperbacks, or having stiff binding or accidentally ripping a page or getting water on it.  It's not waterproof but a couple drops here or there are fine as long as they don't get inside the housing.  I don't have to worry about storing the books I want to reread and having to box them up whenever I move.  I don't have to worry about packing enough books for a vacation and the amount of space they will take up in my suitcase.  Lending books is an issue.  There is some way of lending books electronically, but normally the ones I actually want to lend don't have that option.  Browsing for books is also more frustrating.  Going to a bookstore I can at least verify that an editor has corrected the book for grammar, proofreading and quality, where as in the kindle store that is never guaranteed and you can't always tell from the price."",""I miss having physical buttons, but the screen is better.""";;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I did get the kindle with special offers. They honestly do not bother me at all. You don't see anything while reading, only the screen saver.

"4.0 out of 5 stars,""I now have two kindles and was going to give my old one to my wife to use then found out she cannot get Prime benefits on a new account for her,  without paying for another hundred dollar Prime account. I thought that both of us were included on our one account.She hasn't used it in the month we've had it so I transferred the book I am reading over to it and may sell one of them. Likely this one as my other kindle is a button activated one and it seems to read better to me.If you are a first time Kindle buyer this is a great reader. If you are upgrading from the mechanical button basic kindle my advice is to keep your old one, or skip this one and get the Paperwhite with backlight. I haven't tied that one yet, but the backlight and advertised better readability might be worth it.I don't know why but I prefer my old one. We do have three Windows 8.1 Tablets, two 11.6"""" ones and one 10.8"""" Venue 11 Pro with full HD and IPS screen so we don't need Internet on our readers. And no, I do not like the larger tablets for reading with the outdoor light washing them out in sunlight.So I give this one four stars as a standalone, and one off for not really giving me anything more than my first one which I switched back to. I would take another star off for the Prime not being a real family membership where my wife can have her own account and get the same deals on her books etc. We both watch the streaming on our Fire TV and like it. This Prime thing is like saying that she should not watch too as she does not pay a separate hundred bucks for a Prime account of her own.Of all the transactions I've had with Amazon over the years this one seemed completely out of character. Sure, we can """"pretend they are the same person on them and just load her books on one and my books on the other but why? You guys should allow a family plan which all come from the same IP address or router. Easy enough to check. Maybe limit it to four before we have to lie about it."",Great for a first device.";;;;;;
"4.0 out of 5 stars,""I like the first one better.  This is a little too wide to fit comfortably in your palm as the other did.  It's way heavier.  The screen is not as bright in dark rooms.  The touch menu is at the top instead of the bottom, and everything's now by touch, so it's easy to accidentally send yourself somewhere you don't want to go.  You can now swipe to turn pages, though I didn't mind squeezing a button on the side to turn a page, since it (the old one) fit comfortably in my hand.  I still give it 4 stars because Kindle readers are great products"",Great product but I liked the old model better";;;;;;

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""This review is for the 7th generation Kindle, 6"""".  First of all let me start by saying it is very important to know what you want to do with your Kindle before purchasing one.  Know WHAT you are buying!  This is a very BASIC Kindle.What it is not:  It does not come with a light  It does not use 3G or 4G and does not have the capability.  It does not allow a user to browse the Internet.  It does not allow a used to play games.  It does not show color.What it is:  It is very lightweight  It uses WiFi to download books  It uses E-ink to display titles, words, etc.  It has a touch screen that is very clearly laid out  It is very easy to use without all the """"clutter"""" of apps that comes with Kindles that do have Internet access.  It has extra options on the screen, such as a dictionary, Sync to Furthest Page Read, Note pages, etc.  It has a long battery lifeLet me explain why my """"nots"""" do not matter to me.  I never read in a dimly lit area or in the dark, so I did not care about having a light, although if allowed to pick one feature to change, I would probably ask for a light.  However, I do not find it necessary to have one.  With this product a person MUST have WiFi access to download books which is fine for me since I have WiFi at home.  I download all my books at home so that I will have plenty to read before leaving on a trip.  If you want to download books anytime/anywhere, this is NOT the product for you.  If you are wanting to play music, games, tune in to social media, surf the Internet, etc. this is NOT the right Kindle for you.  I use my laptop and smartphone for all the above, but did not want this on my Kindle.Now, let me tell you why I LOVE this Kindle.  This is so lightweight that I feel like I am almost holding nothing even after I put it in a case.  I love the fact that it uses E-ink instead of a backlit screen because my eyes are sometimes a bit sensitive and eyes grow  tired if using my daughter's Kindle Fire to read.  With the E-ink I can read for a longer time.  I really like the touch screen and do not understand the negative comments about not having """"page turners"""".  The page can either be swiped to the side to change or the bottom right-hand corner can be tapped to change to the next page.  When the top is tapped a menu to go to the home screen, Amazon shopping cart, search bar, font, and extra options is displayed, which is so easy to use.  I do enjoy the extra options menu because it has just enough extra features without being too many";" like the """"clutter"""" of apps I mentioned in the above section.  Please understand, I enjoy using apps and like them on my smartphone, just not my Kindle.If you are wanting a Kindle that will do everything a computer or tablet will do, then I recommend purchasing another type of Kindle to meet all your needs.  But, if you are just wanting to read books electronically without other stuff to get you sidetracked, then this quite possibly could be the Kindle for you.I love reading books and having the ability to finish a book then download another one immediately as well as storing my previously read books.  I also really like being able to look up the meaning of words found in my book from a dictionary right at my fingertips and never stop reading.  My Kindle is reserved for reading, pure and simple and I am LOVING using it.Hope this helps.  :)"",Wonderful Product If You Know What You Are Buying.";;;;;
"4.0 out of 5 stars,""I only gave 4 stars, because it is about meeting expectations.  I was thinking I could read crochet books and such on the Kindle, but it really isn't great for detailed drawings.  It isn't a fault of the Kindle, just something I hadn't thought to consider.  It is only a 6"""" screen, so there is only so much space available.  I do enjoy reading books on it, and that is really what I bought it for.  It is comfortable to hold, more comfortable than an actual book, especially when my kitty is sitting on my lap.  It is also better than an actual book in that you can adjust the font size";" that comes in handy in a low-light situation.  I like that I can borrow books at my local library for the Kindle without even going there.  There is also a large selection of free and public domain titles to download without charge on Amazon.  I will finally read a lot of the classics I missed.  The battery seems to last a long time.  I only recharged it so far because I plugged it in to check on books to download.  I just wish it came with a good, protective cover, I will have to buy one or make one.  I am a little afraid to take it with me anywhere without one."",Great Entry-Level e-Reader";;;;;
"4.0 out of 5 stars,""This Kindle allowed me to get back my Paperwhite after daughter made off with it to read Heroes of Olympus series books.  With my Kindle, the next volume was readily available so she could keep going without signing up for the waiting list at her library or making a trip to the bookstore.This model is inexpensive and sturdy enough to be appropriate for an older, elementary age kid.  I'm not following her around, taking it away from her while she tries to keep reading through eating and brushing her teeth.The price point allowed a family member to give this as a holiday gift, allowing me to receive my paperwhite (back again) for a second holiday season in a row!  Everyone is happy now.  Daughter is really not interested in the device in any way, only the books on it.  I suggest setting up an account for the recipient, setting up the device, and loading them up with books you know they want ahead of time unless they are fully comfortable doing this on their own.  We did this and carefully returned the Kindle to the original box.  It's really nice for the recipient to turn it on and go, growing comfortable with the Kindle as they use it.The limitations are that this model isn't for reading in the dark (probably just as well) and doesn't seem to have the family sharing feature although you can share if the other Kindle involved does allow that.  The sharing is fairly confusing still, they have work to do there, but it's OK.  The case parts and form factor are not as nice as more expensive models but this is a reasonable trade off for the price.Hate the Facebook Good Reads feature built in.  Dear Amazon, please remove that as part of your OS and make it an optional feature for those who want it.  Super annoying bloatware, not interested.  I recommend keeping junk from other businesses off your clean and simple device.  Yuck."",""Good Buy, Especially for Kids""";;;;;;
5.0 out of 5 stars,This is my first time owning a kindle ereader. When it first arrived  I was surprised at how high quality the screen was. It reads like an actual book and is very light. I love the new x-ray feature which gives descriptions and background information on each of the characters in a book. It's the perfect size. I hear people saying that the plastic on the back feels cheap but its fine to me and has a nice touch.The only thing I don't like is how easily the kindle can get scratched around the the kindle logo.

3.0 out of 5 stars,The good: I love being able to have all of my books in one place whenever I want to read them so this kindle is perfect for me.

It is hard to see in dim lighting. Also when reading the books you can see a fade of the prior page in the background.The bottom line: Overall this is a good product. I would suggest getting the paper white version if possible. If you cannot get the paper white I would suggest buying a clip on light if plan on reading it in dim lighting.,Good Kindle but Buy the Paper White if you can;;;;;;

One other common complaint were adds...There are two versions of the machine, one with adds that is cheaper and one without.  If you buy the cheaper version, you are paying a lower price because of the adds.  If you don't want adds, pay the higher price.

I started using my Kindle on December 4th and have not been notified to charge it yet so, that is a plus (I have had wifi on the whole time, the charge is getting pretty low though).Other: The Kindle's lack of page numbers is really annoying. I like having the ability to glance down and seeing how far into a book I am. The Kindle does not allow this. HUGE bummer. The Kindle allows you to highlight passages and makes notes. It's a nice feature to have and I have already used it. The Kindle has some quirk I have yet to figure out. When I drop it on my head while reading (yes this does happen often as like I said above, its slippery plastic shell is not cool) or hits something on accident when I set it down, it changes the font size.

"3.0 out of 5 stars,""I started with one of the keyboard 3G kindles, then moved up to a first gen Kindle Fire. I loved both of them. The screen on the keyboard one cracked, so I had to take the fire around with me. It's quite heavy and I had been thinking about getting a regular kindle for the train commute, so I didn't have to carry the fire around. When I saw this one on sale for $49, I took the plunge.Things I don't like about it - the touch screen does seem to be kind of hyper sensitive. Many times, I've touched to change pages and it's jumped ahead several pages. Also, the unit just froze a few times within the first few days of use, and I had to hold the power button in to get it to shut down and then restart it. Upon restarting, it put me back a few chapters. It is hard to see details on the pictures of book covers as you are browsing. The picture is not sharp or focused. I have taken to buying the books on my laptop and loading them onto it because it's useless for browsing. I won't send it back because, for the most part, it serves the purpose for which it was purchased, glitches aside. However, I would not want to have this as my only device to purchase and read books on.The screen is kind of small. Smaller than the keyboard one was. I'm counting that as a neutral point because, although it's annoying to have to change pages more often, it does contribute to the overall compactness of this e-reader. The screen is also dull, which I don't consider a bad thing but you might. I find the lack of back lighting easy on my eyes, however, you can't read it in dim lighting.Things I like about it - It's very light. Probably a quarter of the weight of my Fire. It also starts up instantly. There aren't a lot of bells and whistles, which I like. I bought it so I could read books on the train and it covers that without a bunch of other stuff that could go wrong with it. I like the ability to adjust the font size (you can do this on all Kindles).Overall, I'm satisfied with it for the price. I would be less happy if I had paid the full price for it.

I have a tablet with the Kindle App on it but I always had a hard time reading anything on it because if I was under a light, the screen would glare, and if I was outside, it was impossible to see anything on my tablet at all!

"4.0 out of 5 stars,""This is my 4th Kindle and my least favorite.  It looks and feels cheap.  However, for the price I wasn't expecting a lot, thus 4 stars.  If you expect it to perform like it only cost $79, you'll be happy.  If you buy this version expecting the touch screen to perform like your cell phone or tablet you'll be disappointed.  I found that tapping the screen works better than swiping to turn the page.  If I used my Kindle daily I would want a nicer version.  For reading a couple of days a week this is a great deal.Pros:  It is cheap (I bought it on sale for $59).  It is small and light so it fits easily in my purse.  I like the touch screen well enough, it is fairly responsive for such an inexpensive electronic device.  It is comfortable to hold while reading, a little easier than my Kindle Keyboard because it is lighter and there aren't any buttons to accidentally press while reading.  The screen is fairly responsive when highlighting a word to look up in the dictionary.Cons: This Kindle does not have holes in the side to pop in to a cover";" I like that feature in my previous Kindle Keyboard.  I haven't purchased the cover that is made for it so I can't speak to how well it is designed.  There are no page turn buttons.  Some people might not care, some may.  I thought the screen images would be sharper based on the product description.

At this point it is and will seem to stay something I got for what it was worth when it was on sale earlier this year. (2015)I mean, it's nice. As far as using it though, it can be frustrating for someone with big hands and flat-tipped fingers. Namely, most commands seem to be set up for either a device 1.5 times the size, or for manipulation using only the nail of your finger, if that's even possible. Buttons don't seem to follow the basic logic of finger size in any way. Text links in the browser for instance have no isolation from eachother. Poke one and you may just poke the one near it, or above, even below, or perhaps you'll zoom out instead. I mean, again... I'm glad I got it for what I did.

"4.0 out of 5 stars,""My first kindle was the kindle keyboard so my review is in comparison to that. I didn't update until now due to device storage. The other kindles between keyboard and this one were half the storage so no way was I going to do a backwards step. Overall, I really do like this kindle. It is easy to use. I love the anti glare and how the pages look like that of a real book in that off white colour.There are only 2 points in which I don't like about this kindle.1: Collections names with number of items in them take up 2 lines instead of 1, resulting in less number of collections showing on the one screen. There is plenty of room for the name of the collection and for the number of items in each collection to be side by side. By doing this, more collections could be listed per screen/page. In this instance, I prefer the following: Fiction (10) or Fiction - 10. The word item/s after the number is totally optional.2: When viewing All, collections are no longer at the top with all books listed below them. Even then, with the keyboard, the only items showing after the collections were those not place in a collection. Now, whether they are in a collection or not, all are showing. In this instance, I prefer the way it was with my kindle keyboard: Collections at the top, everything else underneath them and any added to collections not show up in the All listing. The reason for this is because I would only place them into a collection after I had read them. If they weren't in a collection then I had not read them. It just made it so much easier to work out what I had and hadn't read. Now, I am wasting time by having to check on goodreads as to whether I've read the book or not.Other than those two points, I am happy with this device."",Good but...";;;;;;
5.0 out of 5 stars,I love my new Kindle.  It is light and easy to read.  I love my Kindle Fire also but wanted a lighter one that is glare-free to use outside so this one will work perfectly for that.  It is also great that when you have two Kindles you can pick up either one to read your book because the books are in the cloud.,Great Kindle for keeping in my purse;;;;;;
5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent. This is my first reading Kindle and I am not disappointed! Works exactly as described. I have had this for six days and have used about 50% of battery. I have been turning on wi-fi for a few minutes a couple times a day. I have also been reading for one to two hours a day. Happy with battery life.,Love it!;;;;;;
"2.0 out of 5 stars,""I never write reviews and feel bad for rating so low, but two things are preventing me from loving it.1) I loved, loved, loved the """"text to speech"""" option. I would listen to books throughout the day and I even thought it was helping me improve the speed at which I read. When my Kindle died, I never thought that the new generation Kindles wouldn't have that feature. When I didn't see it on the list, I assumed, wrongly, that it was still there. Someone said in a forum """"make sure you choose the Kindle that's right for you."""" I wouldn't have chosen any of the new generation Kindles since none of them have this feature. (I def would have just went with a Kindle Fire assuming that the option is still there.)2) I used to be able to search for and download books anywhere without needing to find a new network. Now, I find that I'm stuck with what I have already downloaded, which is frustrating. I don't always know that I'm going to need to download before I leave home.It's new to me and I want to love it ... maybe I'll feel differently in a matter of months."",Color Me Disappointed";;;;;;
"1.0 out of 5 stars,""I purchased this for my husband for Christmas hoping the glare-free screen would be good for him. Ha! This model has been a huge mistake.  He does not do well with touchscreens as he goes to sleep reading and touches the screen then Kindle changes pages on him. So, he spends a lot of his reading time trying to find where he was in a book - sometimes it's not even the book that is currently showing on the screen. The screen is too easy to change and irritatingly pops up font changes and other garbage. The older models with the side buttons were perfect, easy to use. I have a side button model myself and dread the day when mine decides to quit. Since I can't buy another one on Amazon, I think I'll check out ebay for the old style. Gee, Amazon - good job running off people. PS, their """"customer service""""  folks in India have poor English, it's hopeless, too. Don't bother."",A BIG disappointment from Amazon";;;;;;

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""It took me forever to order this because I was overwhelmed by all the choices of Kindles to choose from. I have a 4th generation basic Kindle for years and love it! When I saw the new one on sale, I decided to upgrade, but couldn't decide which one fit my needs the best (Paperwhite, basic, Hire). I really wanted a Kindle Keyboard, but the don't sell them anymore. I only wanted that one because of the audio reading feature, which I could use while folding laundry or taking a bath, etc. The Fire was out because I only want to read on my Kindle. I read in bed every night so the Paperwhite was tempting due to the built in lights. However, the sale price of the basic Kindle was too good to pass up! For what I would have paid for the Paperwhite, I got a new touchscreen Kindle, pretty leather case, and a clip-on Kindle light. I am happy as a pig in mud! The best feature is that the Kindle automatically turns off when I close the case, and on when I open it! Saves battery life. Also, it saves the words you look up to a special Vocabulary Builder on your Kindle so you can review them and learn the words you didn't previously know. I passed my old Kindle on to my daughter, who loves it! I'm extremely happy with this one! Also, I joined Kindle Unlimited and can get up to 10 books at a time, with no due date!! They have a great selection, so for under $10/month it's a great deal!"",Love my Kindle!";;;;;;
"4.0 out of 5 stars,""So far so good. It is as described. No back light, but the screen looks like a real book which is amazing for technology.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I love being able to read a whole library on a small device that doesn't use a backlight. I travel a lot, so this is much more convenient for me. I actually prefer reading on a Kindle rather than an actual book (unless I want to annotate the book) because I don't have to hold the Kindle open like I have to hold the pages of a book open. I can just prop the device up against something while I'm reading and poke it when I want to turn the page.

"4.0 out of 5 stars,""I have now had three Kindles. The first one, unfortunately, had problems before I used it. Amazon replaced it immediately and I grew quite fond of it. I was very comfortable with software system. But,alas, the second one died totally unexpected. It wasn't a dead battery. It just simply would not turn on and it,s light was dead. So I ordered a new one. The operating software has been upgraded and I,m not all that pleased with the OS. It used to be that I could call on the dictionaries at any time and look up a word from any other book. The new, third, Kindle does not allow me to do that. Other than that all else is okay. It is some what lighter than the metal cased ones and sometimes the screen freezes up on it and it takes several swipes to get it to respond to a simple page turn. So the OS system is why I gave it a four star rating."",I was very comfortable with software system";;;;;;

4.0 out of 5 stars,I thought my first Kindle was broke so I purchased another one and after I received it my first one started working again so I go back and forth between them.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""The Kindle is great for avid readers who also advocate reduction of material-use (and ultimately forest conservation). One can have numerous books in a single e-book tablet.

"1.0 out of 5 stars,""When I first received this new Reader I was so pleased with it until I started to actually use it daily. My God, what did Kindle do to this reader? This is my third Kindle reader and I have to say the WORSE. I am so dizzy going back and forth every time I open it to read to change the font size every two minutes. Also, DO NOT EVEN THINK OF SNEEZING when you are reading. It will turn about five pages with the wind. Another complaint I have is finding previous books I purchased. My last Kindle was so very easy to navigate. This one is a horror. So I am sending my second review for this Kindle to inform everyone who is thinking of purchasing this Reader, beware and pay attention to all the negative reviews, they are right on the money."",Horrible! What Were You Thinking Kindle??";;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""Works perfectly, great size (like reading a pocket paperback except thinner), absolutely no need for backlighting as the screen is perfect. The only slightly negative is the slick finish and that's probably not a problem for anyone that doesn't have very dry skin.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""This kindle is great for the price point. It truly feels like you are reading a real book. The font and look of the screens feels like a paperback. The type has a nice contrast with the background. I would highly recommend this for long time physical book readers because it is an easy transition. This does not have the bright glare of phones and tablets. You will love the ease of carrying around thousands of books in your pocket without ever accidently losing your place. I am an avid reader and for many years I resisted mightly against going over to the dark side of ebooks. But I got a special offer for this and I decided to buy it and give kindle another try. I had bought a kindle about 2 years back and it felt cheap and like an old piece of tech. This kindle is much diiferent, it really has the look and feel of a real book. I joined kindle unlimited and now I read a book a day. I can read at my lunch break and relacing in bed. I love this kindle! The only con is no built in night light."",Awesome entry level Kindle";;;;;;
"3.0 out of 5 stars,""Wanted a kindle I could read in the sun, and one which would have a MUCH longer battery life than my 2 Fires. This fits the bill. It's not so easy to use however. Quite cumbersome to pull books newly purchased on Fire from cloud to non-glare Kindle. Then once downloaded on non-glare Kindle, the book vanishes into the vast library of books read in past and one has to painstakingly search through the books to find new book, usually around 200th in the queue. It's light and portable and once the nook is up I enjoy the reading experience."",Serves the Purpose: Not User Friendly";;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I've had my Kindle for a few days now, since the release date, so 5 days total, and so far I absolutely love it. I was skeptical of the touchscreen, but I find that I actually like it much more than the previous Kindle. It has a """"swipe-to-open"""" feature to unlock the device, in addition to the button on the bottom of the device.It's not bad, but I feel it's a bit redundant when there's a button to unlock the device as well. It also has parental controls which is a nice touch for those who have kids that like to go purchasing things with 1-click. The set-up is just like the previous generation Kindle Paperwhite, which is very clean and well organized in my personal opinion.The casing feels a bit cheap, it doesn't have the smooth back like the previous generation Kindle did, which I was a fan of. Other than the casing I love the device and would recommend it to anyone looking into an e-reader. I would suggest a clip-on light to go along with it if you're one who likes to read in bed, but don't want to spend the extra money for a built-in light."",Much improved";;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I bought two of these, sight unseen, for my wife and me because I happened to catch a great sale. I think it was a good move. The Basic Kindle seems to be all we would ever need.Less than a year ago I downloaded a free Kindle Cloud Reader to my Chromebook and really enjoyed using it, but there are times when reading on a relatively heavy laptop is inconvenient, and can also be distracting since I usually have one eye on my email. I was also trying to share a (limited time frame) free library e-book with my wife, so I got thinking that maybe having a Kindle might be more convenient, more portable...Long story shorter, at the sale price I decided to buy two, one for each of us. They arrived yesterday, with still a week left on that library book. We have only had them for 24 hours and are already nuts about 'em. Easy to use, light weight, uber-portable, individually customizable... I have already established that we can be simultaneously reading the same book on two different Kindles on two different pages with different fonts and font sizes, no problem. The touch screen is very convenient and fairly intuitive, and in any case the full instruction manual is right on board and can be referred to at any time. I have an idea that the spendier Paperwhite is cooler, but the lack of a backlight and a faintly gray screen isn't bothering us in the least, and real books don't have backlights. On the other hand, real books don't have WiFi, but Kindles do. I am writing this review before I have even scratched the surface of what the Basic Kindle can do. I am really impressed! I may one day decide I have to upgrade, but at the moment I can't conceive of a reason."",Basic Kindle is a Terrific Value!";;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I've had this a few weeks now.  Only had charge it once so far, the batteryLasts. The kindle unlimited is just fantastic (free for the first 30 days and I'm hooked now) So many selections!  My nook had kicked the bucket after about 5 years or so, and I'm so glad I switched to kindle. I do so much on Amazon and the points add up on the credit card which can helped pay for this kindle device. My son can use it and read anytime he wants although he's not really a big reader, there are enough selections of books on minecraft that he's actually reading without me having to pester him to do so.  the device itself handles well, I like the cover that was in the bundle, and it's fairly easy to maneuver in. It's much faster thank my nook was as well, which kept dropping the wireless but this kindle does not have that issue."",Good change from nook.";;;;;;
"3.0 out of 5 stars,""The touch screen has problems.  Some of the features do not work, or only work part of the time.  As in, not often.  Mine won't go back into Airplane Mode at all.  Which would save the battery running down so  quickly.  """"Turning the pages"""" forward or backward too often jumps many pages ahead, or drops back many pages, making continuous reading a chore.  You end up spending as much time hunting for where you actually left off as you do reading on a lot of occasions.  [When the earlier Kindle took you right back to where you left off, every time.]  I'm told this is a """"known problem"""" by a friend who is technically knowledgeable.  Certainly maddening.  All in all, this version of the Kindle works far more poorly than my earlier Kindle.  I think Amazon tried to do too much with it, essentially got carried away with hoping readers would be able to have a """"magic touch"""" that is needed for its various but erratic features.

I probably would not have bought this for myself. I like the feel of a book in my hand, the smell of the paper and ink. I like to see them laying on the table, on the shelf. But, my life is changing drastically in so many ways that the Kindle seems to be part of that change. I find it delightful to be able to read books instantly. I see it, I download it, I read it. Or I keep it for another day. The prices for these downloads are frightening because they are so easy to download so I search the bargain book bins, watch for prime specials and will see if my local library provides ebook downloads for free.... And with a chance to travel, I can take the Kindle with me more easily than books....This product has made my transition to the electronic world of books most enjoyable. It is easy to use, although having a sheet of instructions would have been nice. The touch screen is great except I tend to eat when reading.... Greasy fingerprints. The ability to change font size, etc. The ability to see what I have stored on my Kindle is helpful, and storage on the Cloud sounds inviting. And the Kindle is easy to hold, easy to use. Even my cat has learned to turn pages. I tend to want to touch the pages of a book and run my finger along a line of print. With the touch screen such actions turn the page!

"4.0 out of 5 stars,""At first, I really hated this reader. I was so used to my IPad and it just drove me crazy when I tried to search for/download books on it, or even when I used it to read. Everything is a bit clumsy and cheap feeling.But, now, I like it a lot and see some real benefits. For one, if you are just reading, it's very, very light (unlike my ipad) and easy to carry anywhere, without a cover or any protection. You can even slip it in a large coat pocket. The best things are that you can read it like a book, outside in the sun and in bed (without the backlight stimulating your brain before sleep). You can't even see my Ipads outside unless you are reading at night. Also, you just don't have to worry about it. If I take my Ipad or my new ipad mini on a flight, to read at the beach, or waiting for an appointment, I worry a bit-theft, damage, sand. With this, you don't have to. The plastic makes it somewhat bulletproof. If it's lost or stolen, it's a drag, but not a big issue given the price and the fact that there is nothing on it but books.I also use it to read free Overdrive books from various libraries (if you don't know about this service, check it out immediately!). You can download books from your computer or ipad if you don't want to download it on this device (it works, but the browsing for books isn't ideal).For me, I love having both types of readers and this one has proven to be ideal for many situations.Hope this helps you digital readers out there!"",""Disliked it at first.

This worked (although it reset it back to factory settings) and she was able to use it again.  But now the parental controls are off of it.  If the child knows the wifi password they can get on the browser easily.

THERE IS NO KINDLE SETTING FOR THIS IDLE TIME TO REBOOT PERIOD.....Because of a little 'idle time' the kindle must be re-booted -is time consuming:  This consists of Holding down the power button and waiting for 10 to 12 seconds - and then waiting for the 'boot' screen'.  from there you get a boot time odometer then runs for about 15 to 30 seconds....Conclusion;" So, just this complete reboot - until you can read again -  is for  2 to 3 minutesScreen Brightness:- there are no controls what-so-ever, you can choose is text style and size, that it...end...no brightness, paper color, nothing...You cannot read this in a darkened room, a paperback although heavier - is still a little more convenient (easy to see) that this Kindle.This Kindle has good 'synchronization' with an Amazon account, wi-fi connection settings, and other social media liking features....but compared to even a cheap cell phone - nothing, zero...I would not purchase have purchased this Kindle knowing these deficiencies - I would have spent an additional $40 just for the basic features (like available on all current cell-phones) in order to prevent having to spend time, time, and time again - re-booting this kindle between small breaks.I can read fine with it.  It loads my e-books perfectly. I can link to my amazon account(s)...it's just that most settings you would expect for such a device are just MISSING?  Common Device Settings!  As a reading device, it's great, as a replacement for a paperback book - it sucks...Regards,D. DoGoood"",A FEATURE FREE KINDLE TO AVOID";;;;

"4.0 out of 5 stars,""I had this in my cart for forever before I finally decided to buy it. I always used my iPad for reading, but because of the glare I couldn't take it outside.This is lightweight and easy to read. I gave it a 4 star because it would be nuce to adjust contrast on the screen, but this is a entry level user and it doesn't have that feature or a backlight and in hindsight I should of bought one with the backlight.In a low lite room I find it hard to read.But it's super simple to use and read - I'm glad I finally coughed up the cash for it!If you can afford a little more, def go for the backlight as it makes a difference.

"4.0 out of 5 stars,""I really like my kindle - it's easy to read, small enough to fit in my purse - and no glare.  BUT, though I keep buying Kindle books - I really, really prefer paper books.

It's definitely more sensible than a book- it takes up much less space than all the books it carries in its memory, and ebooks  are less expensive, are instantly available, and don't kill trees - but, still - it's just not the same. If you do decide to try an e-reader - I recommend it.  The distractions you have with an I-pad disappear, that's why I got the kindle, it's also very affordable.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I have always loved the feel of a real paper book, and I am not usually a high tech advocate.  But after using the Kindle Paperwhite for a month, I'm hooked.Make sure to get the Paperwhite model!  It is lightweight and easy to hold with one hand.  The device battery lasts forever between charges.  With easy viewability in bed, and no need to turn on bedside lamp, I  just lay it down when I'm sleepy and the screen automatically shuts off.  (I recommend separate purchase of a screen protector as a fairly inexpensive way to preserve your investment).I'm retired and on a limited budget.  There are so many free books to download from the Public Library and no need to even travel there, because downloading a library book to the Kindle is an easy online process.

Our group of ESL teachers would pass our books along to one another or wait all year for the used book fair.  Then I bought my Kindle during a trip back to the US.  I learned I could log into my local library back in the US via my laptop or my smartphone.  I would then check out an e-book.  I turned on my Kindle and activated the Wi-Fi.

Never had to charge it, only read for about 45 minutes on it.Display: Excellent! I tried reading it outside as well as in bed.  Screen allows for readability anywhere as long as you have a light.Function: I wanted this to have a portable way to read books, instead of dragging my laptop everywhere. I believe this would have performed admirably.  I also don't like bookstores, since I am a giant nerd, they often are lacking in the nerdy books I like to read to make room for 1,000 copies of fifty shades of grey. I think online bookstores are the way to go.Bonus: Did not expect this to come with its own web browser.  It has limited capabilities but I think that might have been a handy feature when sitting on the couch watching TV and the need to google something arises."",Don't let your GF borrow it.";;;;;;
"4.0 out of 5 stars,""Lots of people have already posted their reviews about this device. I got it for $49 on Prime Day. For that price, it certainly is worth it.

I'd rather use this Kindle, but because it isn't backlit, I would have to leave my light on, which I'd rather not do. So I can only use this new Kindle in daylight.As far as the ads are concerned, they only show up when the device is turned off, so it's really no big deal and certainly worth a $20 discount.The battery life is great. I've had it on about an hour each day, and still haven't needed to charge it.The clarity of the screen is excellent. I have lowered the size of the typeface to practically its minimum, and maximized the number of lines per page to nearly maximum, and the screen looks essentially like a paperback book. It's very easy to read.And I really like being able to highlight a word and get a definition almost immediately. The """"lookup"""" functionality of the Kindle device is far better than what I get when I use the Kindle app on my iPad.One other advantage of the Kindle device over the app is that I can now """"borrow"""" books directly from Amazon.

I went from a keyboard model (no longer available new) to the new touchscreen display. Love the swipe features. East-to-read instructions for adding notes, highlighting text. Faster Internet connection. The only drawback was my Solitaire and Spades games from my earlier Kindle edition did not travel to this newest Kindle. Besides reading ebooks, these games were my go-to feature to play in my downtime at night while watching a favorite movie. I did buy Tetris to play on this new Kindle, but I haven't yet tried it out. Also I had over one thousand ebooks to transfer over, and I found it faster to charge the new Kindle first and upload ebooks from the cloud on the device itself, rather than selecting twenty-at-a-time from the Amazon.com website under Manage Your Content and Devices."",Great.

My old Kindle is much easier to read than this new technology and that doesn't make any sense to me.

It's a great site and app to help you organize the books you've read, want to read, and to get suggestions for books from friends' reviews. Back to the Kindle, it is great. You have to treat it like a paper book and make sure you have enough light (none are built-in, but there are clip-on light accessories you can buy).

I couldn't be more pleased with this purchase!Though admittedly I'm not familiar with the other reading devices, such as Nook, Sony e-Reader, iPad, etc., I can't imagine any competitor could significantly improve on this Kindle's cost to quality ratio. With the Nexus 7 I was limited to reading inside, because even hazy daylight blotted out the text on that device's screen. With this Kindle such restrictions are meaningless, due to the device's paper-like background on which the text is displayed. Need larger text for poor eyesight? No-problemo whatsoever!

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""When I first received my kindle, I was skeptical of whether or not this reading experience would be more enjoyable than holding a physical book. I often view books as friends, and I believed that like friends, experiences with them in person are more rewarding than through electronic communication. However, this device proved me wrong! I love having access to all of my books in the palm of my hand, being able to easily search particular parts of the book (this is most helpful when writing papers and needing to access quick notes!), as well as having access to an instant dictionary. I highly recommend checking out Kindle, if you've never had one before. This is particularly useful for travelers, students, and avid readers.

The touchscreen is very sensitive, and can be used even with thick gloves on.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I chose this item after much deliberation. I am the type of person who loves technology but found myself not enjoying reading as much from my tablet or from my computer and iPhone as much as I always do from books. Unable to place my finger on the exact reason I had ruled out buying an ereader for quite a while. Eventually after returning to college the issue was revisited as a matter of money and convenience.  I would no longer need to go to the store to purchase or return textbooks, not to mention no longer having to tote around books heavy enough to start midlife scoliosis. I happened to be lucky enough to catch it on sale twenty dollars cheaper with the specials. I got off especially cheap having chosen the glare free without backlighting. I wanted it to read as close to a real book as possible. The touch screen is great. It is appropriately responsive and the dictionary feature makes using the text books especially easy. Also being able to use the """"go to"""" featur for terms and topics within text is great. The battery life is phenomenal. It's lightweight so I take it everywhere and either entertain myself or study if I have to wait."",I love this";;;;;;

The price was really good right before Christmas, $49, so I couldn't pass this up. I bought a cover for it but had to send it back because it didn't fit.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I love my Kindle (7th generation)! It does everything I wanted and expected:• No back light• No glare• Dictionary for unknown words• Character summary by tapping names• Included 30 day free trial of Prime• Battery life is fantastic• Ability to change font• Ability to change text sizeSomething that I wasn't aware of is that your kindle is automatically assigned an email address that you can use to send documents directly to your kindle, pretty cool. The email address is the one you registered to your Amazon account @kindle.com, instead of @gmail.com, for example, easy. But, you can change it in your settings if you like.I was worried that the 6"""" might be too small, but It's the perfect size. The screen is very clear and the spacing between lines makes it clean looking and easy to read. I have not adjusted margin and spacing settings as I like the default, but of course you can adjust them. The caseing is very sturdy and nice looking. The touch screen makes the kindle very easy to use. It was also very easy to sign up for Prime, only one tap! It was also easy to sign up for Goodreads, which allows you to see what your friends are reading, read reviews, ect. (I'm still learning about that)All in all a great buy for anyone who wants a fantastic, simple e-reader, I'm very happy with it. My only complaint is about the special offers on the device that show on the bottom of the home screen and as screen savers when on sleep mode. That's not the Kindle's fault, that was me choosing to pay $79 instead of $99. The good thing, though, is that if you choose to go that route and save the $20, you can later choose to spend the $20 and have the special offers erased from your Kindle at any time."",""Great device, very recommended!""";;;;;;

To be clear, it's not terribly thick and certainly not heavy, but I had one of the original 6"""" Kindles with the buttons (no touch screen) and it was delightfully thin.  This is purely subjective, but this one feels nearly twice as thick - but, again, it's not heavy at all.  It's likely due to the touchscreen, but I'd actually prefer one of the thin Kindles with buttons, but they are no longer available.  All that being said, I got mine for $29 on a one-day sale (it was certainly short-lived) and it is a tremendous bargain at that price.  I'm quite happy with it.

5.0 out of 5 stars,This was a gift for a very happy recipient. I have owned several generations of Kindles and this one is a good choice for an entry level e-reader or someone who isn't concerned about having a lit screen. It is small & lightweight & easy to handle. It has plenty of of storage space & battery life. This Kindle doesn't have the finer resolution that the Voyage or new Paperwhite do but is more than sufficient for the avearge person or someone on a budget. I can't compare it to other e-readers but I've always been very happy with the Kindles I have owned and highly recommend them.,Can't go wrong with a Kindle;;;;;;

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""Before my Kindle, I'd stopped reading for pleasure and read mostly for research purposes.  I felt I just didn't have the time to read a book.  A Kindle makes it easy.  There's only one small thing to carry around.  Ebooks are easy to either buy or borrow.  I use my county's online library system to access ebooks for free and have begun TWO  book series!  As long as you have a wi-fi connection, it takes about 2 minutes to borrow a book online.  And for all that waiting around that is inevitable in life -- your medical appointments, medical appointments of friends & relatives whom you accompany, a quiet lunch retreat, etc -- the Kindle sure makes the inevitable waiting more enjoyable.  At bedtime, it also helps me calm my brain after a long and busy day.  I had considered the paperwhite or a backlit version but then I read that it wasn't good for you to use that version at night (the basic one that requires you to supply room light, just like a regular book, is okay), I stayed with the 7th generation version and I've been very satisfied.  If you've been toying with the idea of an eReader and if part of you has been longing to pick up a book again, try this basic Kindle.

"4.0 out of 5 stars,""The only reason I have this 4 states instead of 5 is that I have no idea what the ads will be for. I purchased the Kindle because I got an email offer from Amazon for a reduced price. I have had a Nook for years now and didn't see that there would be too many advantages to having the Kindle. Let me begin...I use my library a lot, for ebooks as well. With the Kindle they are transported immediately. With the Nook, I had to manually load the book from my computer.The price was great. So far the ads aren't bad, but they are just there, they aren't there when I am reading, just as the screen saver, kind of.The battery life is similar to the Nook, without using the glowlight, which honestly, I rarely did. Camping was the one time I REALLY appreciated the glow light.The Amazon library and free books.

Basically, every time you turn on the device, there is an ad for some random book from Amazon. Not a huge deal, but still kinda lame. I guess you can get one without the ads for a more expensive price, but I didn't realize that at the time of purchase.

The e-ink technology definitely replicates the look and feeling of reading a book, without the hassle of trying to carry a library with you.This is perfect for someone who loves to read and travels a lot.

I do not find this true in either case and maybe you can tell me how to adjust it it's nice to have all my books with me that I need to read and research so that is a definite pro plus.  I think I also thought it was in color but that's not a problem.  I did notice however that it doesn't have a speakers and that is one of the pluses for the article. Until I got this I have been taking my iPad with me and it was good to and of course I could adjust the screen but then you get the advertisements when you're might not want them or something jumps and when you're trying to read that you might not want but I think you might need all in all a nice reader and I enjoy having it with me and easy to carry.

The updated software with Goodreads, ability to get summary information on books and improved X-Ray just make this a terrific bargain.

I prefer to read with a light shining on the reader rather than having a lighted display so this is just perfect for me. The fonts are nice and crisp and absolutely excellent.  I know that some of the more expensive models have better specifications or more dots per inch (DPI) for fonts but this one is just excellent and again much better than the original Kindle.  Also, the processor speedup makes a difference.  I would certainly recommend it to anyone unless they just have to have the backlight feature....Only one thing you need to be aware of:  If you have a snap on cover for the older Kindle Touch, it won't work on this model.

"3.0 out of 5 stars,""The Kindle holds the lion's share of eBook capital and I decided to switch to eBooks about a month ago. I chose this Kindle because it was on sale for Black Friday. I love the convenience of the eBooks but I'm slightly disappointed with the actual device.For what you pay here, you get the bare bones plus the pleasure of viewing ads when you're not in the middle of a book. It's fine by me because you only need the UI really when selecting a new book to read, which happens about once or twice a week for me, amounting to about ten minutes a month with a little book or shoe ad wedged in the bottom corner. The touchscreen, which I thought would annoy me, is actually very nice and I have seen no need for physical buttons to tun pages.The Kindle is a great ecosystem (lots of books at fair prices and plenty of distribution options) but it gets 3 stars from me due to its shortcomings regarding the hardware. No, this device doesn't come with a light, but that's clearly marked so I knew I wasn't going to get the light. However, I think it's silly to pay an extra $50 or so for the Paperwhite (the model above this that is backlit) for what amounts to a cheap, weak flashlight. I know there are other benefits (higher pixel density, maybe it's a little lighter) but those changes shouldn't cost so much more.One other thing to note: This device is a little heavier than I thought it would be. It's not uncomfortable by any means but it's worth noting here. It's also a little slippery: I would suggest buying a case for it. Amazon has a lot of cases available for ~$10."",""Mediocre device, great ecosystem""";;;;;;

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I sat on my old glare free kindle so needed to replace it.  I am so happy I did.  I got a good sale price, pretty fast shipping (since it was free) and I like the updates.

Even though there are fancy tablets out there I like reading the glare free screen as it just seems easier on my eyes.  I would recommend this e reader."",An updated replacement";;;;;;
5.0 out of 5 stars,Since I am such a big kindle fan when I saw this one I thought it would make a great gift for someone in the family. I love the fact that I can take my entire library with me anywhere I go without breaking my back carrying all those books. This kindle is easy to use and the glare free screen makes it easy to read outside or in bright light. The screen is clear and whether it is a pdf file or a kindle book it is easy to navigate through the book. Overall I think this is a nice basic kindle for someone who doesn't need all the bells and whistles that come with the fire editions.,Another kindle to add to the collection;;;;;;

"4.0 out of 5 stars,""This is a great little piece of technology. Perfect for reading on the go, it allows you to take your library wherever you go.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I had an older keyboard style Kindle for years and it came up missing.  We looked everywhere for it and figured I'd lost in while traveling.  So I finally decided to pick up this new Kindle.  I really like its size and light weight, and I think the screen has higher contrast and is easier for me to read.  So about a week after receiving it, guess what?  I found the older Kindle in the zippered pocket in a bag, right where I'd put it.  So now I have two.  I have a case for the older one with a light, so I use that at home in bed.  I'll be taking the newer one with me when I travel for its form factor.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""Just got it today, and I really like it, so far, E-ink does take a bit to get used to if you're used to reading on a back lit LED screen. It's not like reading on my laptop, tablet or my wife's Kindle Fire. It is actually like reading a printed page. It's off white color is more like reading a newspaper page than a book to me, but my eyes are really telling the difference. I can read longer on this device with less eyestrain. I am blind in one eye so I needed something like this device.I also LOVE that fact that it doesn't have distractions like push notifications and all the other distractions that come along with using a Fire or Tablet. It's just a plain reader. Just what I was looking for.Easy to set up, has step by step instructions when you turn on the device. WiFi setup was a breeze. I was off and going, reading my first book in about 2 minutes. All my books easily downloaded from the cloud.I like that it's small and lightweight, easy to hold in one hand and turn pages with the touchscreen.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""Picked this up at a local big box store on Feb 23rd. Only had it a couple of days, but I'm loving it. Upgraded from Kindle 2nd Gen that had started acting up after several years and a second battery. This new Kindle has the same 167 PPI as the 2nd Gen, but the difference in clarity in the screens is amazing. The grey background is lighter on the new one, the black text is darker/richer, and the contrast is more crisp making the text more clear. I love the touch screen, so much easier to navigate, access the dictionary, etc. For those who just want a reader, it is definitely a comfortable, lightweight, easy to use, affordable option. The ads on the $80 version are no more intrusive than the pictures on the screen saver of the older kindles - it's just a picture that comes up when the unit is left idle, usually of a book for sale on amazon - not scrolling ads like on computers/games, etc., so paying an extra $20 not to have them is a waste of money in my opinion. Hoping this little one holds up as well and as long as my original one did."",""If you just want a reader, this is the one to buy!""";;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I just added this to our collection of Kindles. I have a K2 and my wife has a Kindle Keyboard. I especially like the XRay feature for looking up characters in the books. I often forget who someone is if they have not been mentioned for awhile. This Kindle has a far superior display compared to my K2 and perhaps a bit better than the Kindle Keyboard. The pages turn MUCH faster than either of the older models that we have and it is lighter too. There is no audio like my older Kindles have, but honesty,  we never used that feature anyway. From what I have read the battery life isn't as good, but that's  not an issue for us as we are retired and use our Kindles primarily indoors so an outlet is almost always available."",Great!";;;;;;
"4.0 out of 5 stars,""The Kindle is true to it's product descriptions. As the description and many other reviewers have stated, it has no back-light. That's fine, however, it's still much darker than I feel it ought to be. At very first I thought I was being stupid with my mental complaints, but then I placed my kindle next to a book page and there was a massive difference. The issue is that the kindle background isn't white, it's gray, so there's not a lot of contrast. I suppose that's what makes the Kindle Paperwhite so attractive, though.The other thing that is disappointing about the Kindle is that whenever you turn a page or do anything with it there's a moment of glitches while the page changes. It's almost a split second, but it happens every time. I'd expected it to be a bit smoother than that.Other than those small complaints, I do like my new Kindle. The extra features are really what makes this device a worthwhile purchase.Edit: I received my Kindle just this past Friday. I charged it fully then proceeded to use it. Since then (it's been five days) the battery is halfway down. I don't know if I just read more than other Kindle users (I don't think I do), but the description says that the battery lasts weeks. At the rate it's going, my Kindle will need a recharge in just ten days, which is technically not weeks, it's days. Obviously, that's disappointing to me, and I did dock my review by one star, but it's still a good battery life for a device."",Mostly satisfied";;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I recently purchased a new glare proof kindle,, and I'm very happy with it. It's super light- weight and the glare proof screen is amazing.

Also, I love to read outside and I will be doing a lot of that this summer with my new kindle."",Fun in the Sun with My New Kindle";;;;;;
"4.0 out of 5 stars,""Not a lot to say here that isn't pretty subjective. I wanted a reader that has a good screen (this one is clear and very readable, could have a little better contrast), is light (it's lighter than most books but heavier than I expected), and has good battery life (probably better if I could remember to turn off the WiFi after I download something). I did not want a reader with more features. I could do without the occasional black-white-black flicker when you turn pages, and I don't get the impression that this simple, plastic device is worth a hundred dollars. In its seventh generation, the basic Kindle is good but could be better for the money. IMHO."",""Capable, too expensive...""";;;;;;
"4.0 out of 5 stars,""This is exactly what I expected from the product description, so I am almost, but not quite, perfectly happy with it. This is a little thing, but while you can put it in landscape mode, it only does it with the fat part of the bezel on the left-hand side. This is really annoying if you want to use your left hand for anything other than holding the Kindle, as might be the case if you are left handed. I can't imagine that it would be that hard to let you flip the display for lefties. One star demerit for dexter chauvinism."",""Great, with one annoying flaw for lefties.""";;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I love my Kindle.  I love the fact that it can judge your reading time and then let you know how many minutes are left in each chapter -- my biggest frustration with my old kindle (one of the earliest models) was that I never knew how long a chapter was.

"3.0 out of 5 stars,""I love the Kindle device, I really do.  But I'm just not really all that happy with this version.  I prefer the way my old Kindle Touch was made.  I don't like the material it is made out of now.  It shows fingerprints (not on the screen, only on the black part) which drives my OCD crazy.  Also, the inside edge of it where the black surrounding part meets the screen has a dip, which collects dust or hair.  This drives me nuts.  I use my Kindle daily because I love to read so much.  I love the Kindle allows me to do that.  I just love my old one so much more because it didn't have either of these issues.  I find I am constantly picking out hair, bits of fuzz, or teeny crumbs out of the little edge.  What annoys me more is that when I do this I have to make sure I'm not actually reading or I will accidentally turn the page 10 times by touching the screen.  So I just try to blow the little nasties away which isn't very effective.  It's just annoying.  I was so excited to be getting the newer version, and I expected to love it just as much as my old Kindle Touch.  I'm not sure if the Paperwhite is made the same way or not.  If it is, and I had gone ahead and purchased that one like I was considering, I would be REALLY upset."",Like my old one better :(";;;;;;

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I love this basic model. I don't need a built in light. This screen has bolder text than Paperwhite and Voyage. I love bold text. The background is light gray. I like light gray-there is less glare than a white background. You only have to tap the screen to turn the page. Simple. No areas to accidentally touch. At the bottom there is a bigger area to hold onto. I like that. The dictionary feature is much more positive than reading on a tablet. On a tablet it can't make up it's mind whether you want the dictionary or the settings window. I can use it one handed-either hand. It fits in my shirt pocket. I like that. It's sooo much lighter than a tablet.I have chosen to use it without a case. Just a sleeve type that also holds the charger.Without a doubt this is the best designed Kindle touch ! Since it is this much fun I plan to buy a second one. I'm afraid the next generation basic model won't be this great. Sometimes change is not good.

I thought I'd hate the touchscreen, but its actually not that bad. Very easy to use, however I feel like the screen is a little smaller than my old one.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I am writing this from the perspective of being a long-time experienced Kindle user vs. someone brand new. From an overall perspective, considering the pricing of the Kindle with Special Offers at $79 vs. higher amounts for the different flavors of Kindle available today, this one is a bargain. If you have wanted to get your kids a Kindle to encourage reading as well as sharing of books but hesitated because $119 to $400+ is a lot of money to risk with a child, maybe at $79 this is your price point.From a size standpoint, the reading screen is the exact same size as the other e-Ink Kindles. It is slightly thicker - but slightly lighter - than the Kindle Paperwhite, but to me it's not really a noticeable difference when you're holding it in a protective cover.Opening up the box, included with the Kindle is a micro-USB cord but no power adapter. That's really annoying. Interestingly, and it seems rather chicken of Amazon, a power adaptor has to be purchased separately for $15 if you purchase it at the same time as you purchase the Kindle (or $20 if you purchase it later), so if you already have a micro-USB charger handy I wouldn't order one of the chargers.There are no page buttons - no buttons at all except for the power button - and turning the page is as easy as tapping the side of the screen with your thumb while you're reading, or swiping the screen with your finger.Reading is easy on this one: in comparison to my Kindle Keyboard, the previous version of Kindle, and a Kindle DX the letters on the screen are much, much darker and easier to read: the display is crisp and dark"",I love it";;;;;;

It duplicates the effort.The touch screen isn't conducive to a left hand page turner.Overall I wish I hadn't purchased this Kindle, I've fought using my Galaxy S Tablet for reading but I guess I'll have to suck it up.

5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this kindle.  I have problem with dry eyes and reading makes that worse especially with the newer computer screens but this kindle is just like reading a real paper book and easy on the eyes.  I love I can adjust the print bigger so reading is a breeze.  I would definitely recommend for reading books for pleasure but I would not  recommend for books with pictures or reference books that you need to be referring back and forth.  I had ordered a book with a lot of diagrams and they were hard to see so I ended up ordering the hardcover edition.,Love this kindle;;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""Love it! Wasn't sure I'd like swiping to turn the page, but I'm so used to it from my iPad that it took about 2 seconds to be glad the buttons were gone.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""Since it was on sale ($59) I had to get it.The best part about it probably the battery life (aside from the price). It seems to last forever.I've tried to read books on a laptop, tablet and a smartphone before and I often get eye strain from staring at the screen or get easily distracted. With the Kindle, this is not a problem. The experience feels like reading a real book and you don't have text messages, emails or push notifications bothering you.I like touch interface and minimal design. The interface does get some time to get used too since it's not it doesn't respond immediately like a tablet or smartphone would.Digital Books on Amazon are more convenient to get than the physical books since I can just download them on the Kindle. No need to carry thick, heavy books in my bag anymore. The Kindle is small and easily portable. Sometimes it's cheaper to get the digital books too, which makes a big incentive to get the Kindle anyway.I also like how I can read a book on my computer running the Kindle app and then opening the same book on another device would ask me if I would like to pick up where I left off."",Great Reading Experience";;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I had been searching EBay looking for a good deal on a used Kindle.  Most of those sold at auction were selling for almost full retail of a new unit.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I had the 2nd generation Kindle a long time ago and gave it to my mom, and I upgraded to an iPad. I have used the Kindle app for years on my Android phone, on my desktop computer and now on my iPad. However, I noticed I was not really enjoying reading full books on my iPad. Partly it's the distraction of all the other things pinging me (Facebook, email etc) but also the backlighting was causing eye strain. So, when a sale came up on the nice little pocket sized Kindle, I grabbed it. So happy I did! Very light weight, perfect for purse and daily train commute (I was always scared to haul out my huge iPad especially with the thefts going on), and I can jam through a book much faster. I like the improvements they made in the navigation, much easier to flip pages. I'm delighted, will enjoy this tremendously. BTW I got my mom a Fire later, but she never used it.

"2.0 out of 5 stars,""I had a keyboard kindle for many years, and am now trying to find a replacement. I now use my Kindle Fire Hd. When I received this tiny little kindle it felt like a child's toy.  I had no trouble with registration, tho it is different, nor was there any glitch with transferring all content.  First, I do not like the type of Homepage. You can only see a few books at a time. Pulling them up requires several different moves. Other content such as """"definition"""" constantly pop up when barely hovering over a word. Secondly, the most annoying feature, in swiping A  page, many many times it will swipe several, then going back, it will swipe many more. So I constantly have to be aware of the percent sign at the bottom of the page. That is VERY interrupting to reading fluidly. I am giving up and going to see about returning it. It is way too much trouble, something I never experienced with my Kindle with buttons, or my Fire with swiping."",Not your mother's kindle.";;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""Great basic e-reader.  I received mine as a Christmas present.  It is everything it is advertised to be.  It has 4G of memory with approximately 3G available for storage.

And I still have roughly half of the available memory left..........1.524G to be exact.  The lack of a light was a known factor and like some have noted, a book doesn't have a light so just reading with a lamp on solves the problem or obviously it is not a problem in daylight or bright light.

Then that one died (the curser wouldn't work so I couldn't pick a book etc.).  So I was hesitant to replace it, but it is a good deal better than the other model and easier to use.  Also easier to order more books.  I also had the first model of the Kindle Fire, which stopped charging, which is a huge disappointment as I like the option of the light for reading at night.

I contacted Amazon & since the sale price was within 7 days of the delivery of my item they quickly refunded me $20. Score! Yay Amazon! I love being able to tap the page to turn it, very easy when I am lying in bed reading. Easy to navigate and figure out. These seem to go on sale with any/every holiday out there, so keep an eye out if you are in the market. None of our Kindles have ever had a problem. These are a no brainer for kids.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I used to be an avid reader in middle and high school but the stress of college put pleasure reading as very last on my list, if it ever made it at all. Another change was that I got an iPhone my sophomore year and from then on I was proponent of consolidation and having as much as possible in one easy to access place (music, games, email, etc.) I think having this preference and mentality made it worse for reading as a book was just anthoer bulking thing to add to my book bag. At last, I asked for a Kindle as a late late Xmas/birthday gift and it's been the best gift I've received so far. My favorite part is how you're able to track your reading progress. It's lightweight, easy to store, has all the books I could ever want, and there's never any chance of ruining the book. I always hated and lamented ruined books. Finally the ease of purchasing books is the best feeling ever! All in all, I'm glad to become an avid reader once again."",I'm an avid reader again!";;;;;;

The screen improvements since my first one make it even easier to read. Like no clicking to turn the page. That sound can be annoying if my husband is trying to sleep while I'm reading.

"4.0 out of 5 stars,""I like this Kindle.  I previously owned the very first Kindle model, but it was dropped which killed the screen and had to be replaced.  Maneuvering on that model was super simple.  It's not simple and intuitive on this model.  And what I HATE is that, like with so many other things that are manufactured these days, a physical instruction manual doesn't come with it.  Even a quick reference guide would be better than nothing.  I can't tell you how many times I touched something unintentionally, and it wasn't obvious or easy finding my place again as it was on the old model.  On this thing you have to use a slider bar to guess where you were and skim pages to figure it out because if you choose """"last page read"""" it takes you right back to the wrong page you accidentally arrived at in the first place.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I'll be comparing this to the other two Kindles I have experience with - the Keyboard and the Paperwhite.First order of business: This does not have a light! Sorry, it's just that so many people seem to think it has a light, when it clearly states that it doesn't. If you want a light, get a Paperwhite (they're great, too).This simple little Kindle was a deal (crazy sale) that I couldn't pass up, as I knew I'd need a replacement for my Keyboard model anyway. I also need something to slip into my bag so I can read while I'm waiting or sitting in a coffee shop or commuting.Screen size: About the same on all three models. This makes sense, but I decided to mention it.Resolution: The resolution is better than that of the Kindle Keyboard (again, this makes sense since it's a later model of Kindle) and almost as good as the Paperwhite.Color/Brightness: This isn't a tablet, so there wouldn't be any color (I've seen it mentioned in other reviews, which is why I mention it here). The screen appears as bright as the Kindle Keyboard - that is, it looks like the page of an open book. It is not as bright as the Paperwhite, so there is not as great a contrast. This isn't a complaint, though, since the Paperwhite is always lit (when I compared, I had the light setting down as low as it could go) and by nature will always be brighter.Page Turn: I miss my buttons, but the touch screen is nice as well. The Kindle 6"""" that I'm reviewing here seems to have a very sensitive touchscreen, as compared with the Paperwhite. This means that if you brush against it, it might go forward or back a page or two. I fixed this by getting a cover and closing it when I'm not immediately reading. Really, that's all it took.Speed: I had no issues. It was quite quick to load whatever I wanted.Collections: You can import your collections from your cloud, though you'll have to download each book individually. This was actually a good thing, since I'm realizing I don't need ALL of my books on my device all the time. Heh, maybe that has something to do with how fast this thing is.End grade: 4.5 stars, rounded up. I'm biased, though. I just really love the Kindle (and I'm still amazed at how many free books there are).Added: If any issues come up, I'll amend this review."",Very Happy";;;;;;
"4.0 out of 5 stars,""Ok, I'm giving it four stars because it works well. But I only use it as a backup because, believe it or not, that back light is a very important feature, and this Kindle does not have it.

After having a back lighted Kindle for so long ( I thought it died, which is why I bought a new one - it didn't really, it was just frozen - so maybe it's in the process of dying? Anyway....) Going to this one was too much of a hassle. So I wound up buying a new Paperwhite within a couple weeks.

If you think you are getting an iPad for cheap, think again. An iPad it is not. It is a reader- an alternative to paper. It has a very basic Internet browser (subtract a star), but hard to use. I found this great for kids because it is bomb-proof and cheap (add a star). It doesn't have a back light so you can't read it at night or in the car (subtract a star) The parental controls are minimal, but I can see if my kid is ordering off Amazon as I get emails.

I don't want any extra do-dads that will inspire my teens to acquire and hijack my kindle. Most of all it has to be tough for the work shop. This is simple, tough, light, affordable, and saves a lot of room and weight for all I need to carry. It proved its worth in just the last 4 day trip I took.

I'd considered purchasing the basic Kindle reader for these purposes but wasn't motivated to follow through until it was recently on sale for $59. I am enjoying it much more than I expected!

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I had resisted buying an e-reader for a while. I love to read and I always have, but for some reason e-readers just felt wrong to me. I didn't think they would read like a book, and they seemed too expensive to justify the purchase compared to the $6-$8 per title I tend to spend on used books. I tend to have a couple books I'm reading at any given time and I like to bring them everywhere with me, and it was getting increasingly harder to shove 3-4 paperbacks into my laptop bag everyday to make sure I had something to read everywhere I went, so with the price of e-readers coming down I thought I'd check them out.I found this refurbished Kindle for around $60 so I ordered it. I've used it every day since. I love it. It's super convenient to be able to bring such a huge library with me from place to place in such a small package. And to my surprise, it really does read like a book. I don't feel like I'm looking at a screen. The electronic ink is really easy on the eyes and looks just like the page of a book. I've been reading on it for at least an hour and half every day since I've gotten it.If you're already a very active reader and are considering getting an e-reader, I would give this a try.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""The recent black Friday sales on this unit convinced me to purchase a replacement for a five year old Kindle that was losing contrast (or maybe it was my eyes). At any rate the glare free unit is small, but with a viewable screen the same size as my original. How? the touch screen capability replacing the side direction keys and the keyboard. The readability is darn near amazing, allowing these old eyes to read in subdued light. I personally do not find the ads to be a problem, especially since you can turn the screen to blank if you desire. I find most of the ads interesting as they generally refer to books I might like to read. Battery life is good, but it is too early to tell if this will last. The unit is very light (hence the battery concern) and very portable. The charger cube does not exist on this unit, but since it is a micro usb, your phone changer will likely work. Charging time appears to be reasonable, I had approx. two week of reading nightly, which showed about half battery usage.

There were no marks on the device when I picked it up and thoroughly examined it. This Kindle is well built.The only downside I've had so far is the touchscreen. Often when I'm reading, I bump the screen and the pages switch or the font changes sizes. Sometimes I wish it still had buttons and a feature to disable the touchscreen when reading.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I bought this Kindle to replace my previous Kindle, which I had owned for more than three years.  The previous Kindle had buttons on the side to page back and forth and handle other actions on the device, and I was admittedly hesitant to buy this one due to having all functions on a touchscreen instead, especially since I have large fingertips.  Thankfully, I have had no problems using any of the functions on this device, and I also like its faster speed and larger storage capacity.The one drawback, which is admittedly very minor, is pressing a button to wake up the device, and then still needing to swipe the screen to actually use the device.

"2.0 out of 5 stars,""Loved my first Kindle with the keyboard.  I am not as happy with this one. Grip: All the books are stored in the cloud (what ever that is) with no separation from books that have been read. If one is a voracious reader, at book a day or at least 4 books a week. There is no longer an """"Archive"""" for books read only the cloud.  I have a little over 1600 books. Books that are removed from """"Device"""" return to the cloud and are first in the queue. This system forces me to dig through everything I have already read to find new reading material.  It will skip several pages, at once, if care is not taken when trying to turn pages. The images of the bookcovers are so small it is almost impossible to read the titles when looking at queued books. With any type of vision impairment it would be impossible. I preferred having the list of unread books written out in order of purchase or in sequence if a series. Yes it is smaller as there is no longer a keyboard. It is a bit lighter but not enough to hold with just one hand IF one is older and arthritic.

Sorry Amazon, you blew it with this one."",Loved my first Kindle with the keyboard";;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I've never owned an e-reader before, but am thrilled that I took a leap and tried this one.  It's not the same as paper books, but there are lots of advantages that a paper book can't offer.  I can get books instantly from the library whenever I want.  I can find out the meaning of a word at the touch of a button.  I can search for the same word or phrase elsewhere in the book.  I can turn the page with a touch of a finger.  I love this device and suspect it will be a long time before I read another novel in paper format.I chose this basic model over the Kindle Paperwhite and am very please with my choice.  The Paperwhite primarily adds front lighting to allow you to read in the dark.  I would rather not read in a dark room anyway and use a bedside lamp at night, so I don't need the light in my Kindle.  The text is extremely clear with the ability to increase font size as desired.  The only difficulty I have had with the device is remembering that the touch screen works like a mouse with single touches in identified locations, rather than like a tablet or smart phone that understands """"swipe"""" touches.  This is not a serious issue since there are very few interactions, besides turning pages, that I need to do with the Kindle.

She enjoys reading stories with color and pictures and this is not necessarily suitable for her age because it is missing color and pictures.As an owner of several Kindles, I do like how the screen is glare free compared to the Kindle Fire and Kindle Fire HD.

The fact that it doesn't have a back light makes it feel more like a real book to me. I also found that reading on my phone or tablet made my eyes tired a lot faster than reading a book.

I don't regret getting the i pad but I found that I didn't use the kindle app on it as much because reading on it after a while bothered my eyes.  I saw the promotion for this kindle for 29 dollars and thought what the heck I miss my old kindle why not try the new one for 29 dollars.Its a basic kindle e reader it does its basic job well.  I find it easier to navigate over the first kindle. Its nice and small but not too small and lightweight. I have only been using for about 3 hours but I love it.  especially since I wont get distracted by other bells and whistles.  For 29 dollars this was a great purchase.  I have a feeling they may be phasing this model out or getting ready to release a new model.I am not bothered by not having a keyboard or page turning buttons.

I read a review where someone mentioned having the background a little lighter grey and I agree but its nothing a book light or good lighting wouldn't fix.Overall I am thrilled with this purchase at such a great price.

I don't know why it can't hold the setting you put in when you start reading a book because, as you know, fonts, etc. have to be changed from book to book.  I also don't like that it doesn't have the buttons so that I can play all my old word games.

Getting my book immediately and for a lower cost than the hard copies is a big plus.  Also the light weight of the Kindle is excellent.  I like to read in bed and my arms and hands no longer get tired or cramped with the Kindle.  So, overall, and so far, the Kindle has lived up to its expectations and I am very pleased with it.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I am in love with this Kindle. I will be honest, after having issues with my first Kindle (I believe it was the 2nd generation) and then the Kindle Fire, I vowed that I would never buy another Kindle device again. Instead I would just use the free Kindle app on my android tablet or phone. That was before I started having migraines nearly everyday. Reading on a backlit screen, such as my laptop, phone, or tablet made these migraines worse. Being an avid reader I decided to give the Kindle another try.The size and weight of this Kindle is perfect. Its comfortable for both one handed and two handed reading. I have arthritis in my hands so this was really important. The text is crisp and clear. It is so much easier to read than on a tablet or other similar device. It really feels like I'm reading a real book instead of a digital book. The battery life is AMAZING. I binge read 4 rather long books - took me about a week and that battery lasted the whole time. With lighter reading the battery lasts much longer. It's over a week since I last charged it and its only at about 75%. My first Kindle did not have the touchscreen feature and I must admit, I love it!I did try the web browsing, but honestly, if you want to web browse, use a different device. This device is made for reading books, it excels at that. If you are buying it for the option to browse the internet there are plenty of other devices that do that. I suppose the only feature that would be nice on it would maybe be text-to-speech, but its not really missed. It would be easier to listen to audio books on my phone anyway as that is a smaller device and can just sit in my pocket.If you want an excellent e-reader, you can't beat this one.

The only thing that I am not as crazy about on my new Kindle, is that the edge has been squared off instead of having a more gentle, rounded, sloping edge.  I notice that my husband's Paperwhite also has the more sloping, rounded edge, which is a tad easier to hold. The squared off edge, as Kindle 6"""" Glare-Free has, is a tad less comfortable, but I am sure I will get used to it, especially with all of the new features.

My wife's Paperwhite has 2 MB memory, while the newer Kindles have 4 MB memory.  It is worth it to get the Kindle case with the device as it protects it well, shuts it down when you close it, and turns it on when you open it.

After playing around with it for about a week, I decided to give her the new one.For a basic e-reader at the price I paid, it's definitely a good investment. When comparing to my older model however (a Kindle Keyboard 3G), this new one just feels very cheaply built. It's a very lightweight, plastic design that feels almost hollow on the inside. I get the impression it could be even thinner than it is, but the thickness of the design somehow keeps the production costs down.Having been so used to the solid feel of my Kindle Keyboard, and really gaining nothing new or better with this model (in my opinion), I chose to stick with the Kindle Keyboard as my """"go to"""" e-reader. My wife has been very happy with this model and it gets the job done. Regarding the """"special offers"""" that keep the purchase price lower, I can't see any reason why someone wouldn't be in favor of this. The offers are not intrusive at all and I've actually come across a couple of good reads based on what's displayed while the reader is off."",A Decent E-Reader For The Price";;;;;;
5.0 out of 5 stars,For a strict e reader this product is good. I always use a book light and I can truly say it does have an appearance of a real book which I enjoy. It doesn't have a glare and battery life is outstanding. Been using mine for a solid week for hours at a time and battery hasn't budged. Prices for books on the kindle are also very affordable and cheaper than regular books which is nice.,Like a real book;;;;;;
"4.0 out of 5 stars,""i had the first  kindle and this new is much better and the software is elegant to use. the is one problem and that is because the kindle is so light and the edges to hold it so small that i was constantly  touching the screen and turning pages before i wanted. I FOUND THE SOLUTION """"FLYGRIP"""". I  found this product and it lets you hold the kindle comfortably, you can manipulate all functions one handed, and you NEVER accidently touch the screen.. this item is as elegant a solution as the kindle software.

"4.0 out of 5 stars,""I am terrible at reading directions, so I sort of perused the instructions and am fending on my own.  What ever mistakes I make are my own.  However, so far, so good. The device is small enough to carry around much like a soft paper back.  It is so easy to change fonts, go home to find other books if I have to go back to another, or find the author if someone asks, etc.  The presentation of books is what is throwing me off since I was used to a linear look, not books, but I will get used to it (unless I can change this and I haven't noticed how?) That brings me to the other issue of having my books from the first device I owned in the """"cloud"""" brought back, some titles I remember, and others I don't...guess I better read the instructions on """"how to"""" retrieve these items.  Other than these draw backs, it is a clear and seamless device, as promised, glare-free and easy to use."",""Clear, easy, and it grows on you!""";;;;;;
"2.0 out of 5 stars,""My previous Kindle, a basic with the buttons, was far better. It was easy to turn pages by simply pressing a button on the edge. This one often  requires more than one swipe to turn a page. The touch screen is also annoying because a slight wrong touch brings up the font size screen, which seems to automatically select the wrong font. My old Kindle kept a list of books I had read. Not so with this thing. I would certainly buy an original from eBay, but the battery would be questionable. Mine swelled and cracked the case."",was far better.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""Easier to read than the kindle app for phone and other devices (which i intend to keep using), and knows where you left off reading on the last device you were reading.  very handy having all your books together.having the screen never really turn off is a bit unsettling, but the battery does last for weeks, as they describe, so it is OK."",Easy to read.";;;;;;
"3.0 out of 5 stars,""I actually returned this product because when I had it in my hands I had trouble reading the screen, it was too dark for me and with no way to back light or turn up the brightness it just wasn't going to work for me at this time. I have vision issues and was hoping to have a kindle that I could read outside but it just strained my eyes too much.  Loved the size and weight though, and for those without vision issues I'm sure it's awesome.  Just didn't work for me."",Did not work for me through no fault of the product";;;;;;
"4.0 out of 5 stars,""I initially purchased this kindle because I had lost my older kindle.  However, I was so pleased upon receving it.  First, I was able successfuly to transfer many of my already purchased stories and books to the new kindle with ease.  Second, it fits into my suit pocket, and so I am able to carry it without fear of losing it.  One negative is that the system I must utilize to reach books and stories requires that i go though sales offers every time. I did buy a cover, which is useful as I occasionally drop it.  In my condo, there is wall to wall carpeting, and so that not a problem there.  But when I go out, the cover is very useful.  I have about 160 stories on the kindle, and it will hold many more. I highly recommend a kindle for those of us who really like to read.  This is the best kindle I have owned."",Best Kindle I Have Owned";;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I received a Kindle 5-way as a xmas present three or so years ago. I was hooked. I loved it so much that I bought a Kindlefire HDX Wi-Fi with 64 gig of memory for my wife. She was too afraid to use it. But I loved it  The resident geni in the box, makes it the MOST of the very best of any tablet of any brand. I always have both kindles running at the same time 24/7. Amazon's Kindle 5-way is by far the best for finding and buying books. The FireHDX is best at reading them for you. And a thousand other things.The new Kindle Touchscreen screams plastic and cheap. But it has more capacity (I have more than a thousand Titles Any Idea how large the Catholic Encyclopedia is?) and battery life than the 5-Way, and I swear, it is lighter and thinner also.  Amaz0n continues to knock the ball out of the park."",How can other companies compete?";;;;;;
"3.0 out of 5 stars,""Kind of disappointing. I thought I was replacing my broken paper white model. This model does not have any illumination like my old one. Also, I was not able to use my old kindle cover on this model. Although it appears to be the same size, it's a bit thicker than my old kindle."",Disappointed.";;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I absolutely love this Kindle!  It's compact, lightweight, fits in my hands well and the screen print is dark and easy to read.  But most importantly, it's so easy to use!  The touchscreen makes navigation a breeze.  Believe me if I can do it, so can you.  I tend to shy away from trying new gadgets fearing I won't be able to operate them.  I needn't have worried with this Kindle.  Right out of the box, I turned it on and the screen prompts took me through the set up process which took less than 5 minutes.  I currently have a 1st generation Nook that I have loved for years.  But it doesn't compare to the Kindle.  The Nook is larger, heavier, has more navigation steps, the print is so much lighter, and sometimes the formatting is off.  For these reasons, I'm retiring it in favor of the Kindle.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I've had a Kindle Keyboard for years and decided to do an upgrade when Amazon had their big sale day a few weeks ago and I can say that I'm really satisfied with the new Kindle. It is a real improvement over the old Kindle I had as it incorporates touchscreen technology and a number of other nice features (X-ray, time left in chapter, etc.) that are included in the Kindle Fire I use at times. The battery life is great although not quite as long as my old Kindle but still weeks vs. days for my Kindle Fire. This is really only a single function device ideally suited for reading and I'm absolutely satisfied with the way the device accomplishes that task."",Ideal device for reading books!";;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""Took me awhile to get used to how to use it and get it set up, mainly using caps and non cap letters on the keyboard. At first it would do only one or the other, and still don't know how I got it to do caps, then switch back to small letters?  This was very much needed when setting it up, as the passwords needed to have both, but I finally got it to do what I wanted.  Was glad my eldest son was here with his and showed me a few of the ropes, though I would have figured it out, by playing around with it.  Haven't used it too much as I am waiting for the carry case... it is a heavy, slippery little bugger, but NICE!  So far, I really like it!  My son carries his in a hard case, and is pretty tough with his.... obviously it looked pretty dirty, but he assured me that in his work truck, it may get dirty and banged around, but the unit itself was in clean perfect condition.  I opted against this type of case as reviews said it was hard to get in, and they didn't know how to get it back out... which my son confirmed."",Was glad my eldest son was here with his and showed ...";;;;;;

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""This was an xmas gift for my sister in law who was always borrowing my old kindle keyboard. I had the kindle fire and mostly used the kindle keyboard which most know is similar reading as a paperwhite, when I read outside as the glare was too much with the kindle fire. So she was elated receiving this. When I set it up for her she became frustrated with the touch screen because she was used to the keyboard so we switched. I love it! The touchscreen is easier I think. She's not a very """"techy"""" person. The screen is totally antiglare indoors. I haven't had the opportunity to try it outside yet, its winter here, but I'm sure it's going to be fantastic. I would recommmend it to anyone looking for a basic kindle. As with a regular book you will need adequate lighting to see. This does not come with any back lighting. You can spend more money on the backlit version or just use a book light on the rare ocasssion you may need one.It's simple to use, very easy to set up and navigate. I got mine on sale but even at full price it's worth it."",Love it";;;;;;
5.0 out of 5 stars,Just what I needed. I do not read outside. I have the first Kindle which was much larger and I dropped it and part of the screen would not display.So when this became available at a discount I bought it with no ads and just the wifi. It is perfect for me. I also bought a cover that fits nicely and turns off the Kindle when I close the cover. If you are looking for something to replace having to lug a book or even a paperback around this Kindle is ideal. And with the ability to order books online is a plus. Inexpensive and good investment.,Easy to read and inexpensive;;;;;;
"4.0 out of 5 stars,""I wish there was better light options then the clumsy clip lights. Maybe a little pop up light would be good. Right handed people will get seriously annoyed in landscape mode because you'll want the wide part in your palm but it only turns 90 degrees right instead of the left also.

I spend lots of money downloading books from Amazon, but I think I am done.  I do not believe in paying for extended warranties on products, it is a money making scheme.  I am very disappointed that Amazon does not reward it's loyal customers.  I would have more respect for them if they would replace a Kindle free of charge, or at a truly """"reduced"""" rate for loyal Kindle users.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I bought this for my 8 year old daughter who loves to read. It's so easy for her to use this Kindle. A big plus was that a library near us lets us rent ebooks for free online, so she can keep getting books for it without having to pay too much. The Kindle book prices on Amazon are usually only a dollar or 2 less than the paperback books, so that's a con, but other than that this device is really helpful for kids.

The screen is easy to see even when it's flat on a table. I like that this Kindle has no backlighting because I mainly read at night and I find that computer lights keep me wide awake half the night. Being able to choose a font size is a definite plus (no need for reading glasses!), as is being able to look up unfamiliar words and characters that I totally forgot about, even when they are only one chapter back.

"3.0 out of 5 stars,""It is enough different from the older model, that it takes some time to learn its operation. We found it touchy in that one can get unexpected sub-windows unexpectedly by touching either the top or bottom of the screen. Once one learns that these areas are where the menus are brought forth, it is easy enough to avoid while advancing or paging back. The screen is very sensitive so that it is easy to skip pages. A disadvantage is that there is no indication of what percentage of the book is read, or what page is on screen. The idea of minutes remaining to read the chapter on screen is of little value. Learned one neat advantage of Kindles. I have two, if reading a book on one and switching to the second, the option of going to the page being read is made possible. Really an appreciated feature.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I'm a simple person and I've fallen in love with the simplicity of my kindle! I would have loved a back light but other than that I bring it everywhere I go, it's lightweight and doesn't drag my purse down and I have unlimited books anywhere! Its easy to navigate on and love how I can purchase a book on the app from my phone and sincs to my kindle with Wi-Fi. One of the best purchases I've ever made! Definitely beats buying a new book every week and trying to find somewhere to store it."",Love it!! A great and very smart purchase";;;;;;
5.0 out of 5 stars,I wanted a reader that I could take out to the pool and read.  This works perfectly.  You can read it even in the bright Texas sun.  Perfect!

"4.0 out of 5 stars,""First, I'm not the most familiar person when it comes to the kindle devices. with this kindle, at first glance it looked weird, felt weird ( it really is as light as a feather) and it took some getting used to.. Esp since the only kindle I've ever used was the fire. Now that I've used it a little I really like it. The kindle fire is nice if you want a tablet, but for reading books as your primary focus, it is just too bulky. This kindle is easy to handle, light and easy to transport. It seems perfect to carry in a backpack or take camping due to the small size. If you're a female, you could prob carry this in your purse with no problem (I've seen bigger things pulled out of a woman's purse) lol. The only thing I notice (in my opinion) it seems a little harder to read in the dark then the fire.. Maybe there is a setting for this ? I think I will buy a light for it though. Overall, if you are looking for a light kindle without the bulkyness of the fire, this is highly recommended."",Now that I've used it a little I really like it.

"4.0 out of 5 stars,""Great way to read your books on the go. The display never hurts your eyes, your reading experience is fully customizable and thanks to the 4 GB internal storage you probably won't need external storage devices. Adding books from amazon is extremely simple and books from other sources can also be easily uploaded, provided the format is correct. The device does not accept EPUB so make sure your books are saved as PDF. What really helped me immerse myself in the reading experience was the vocabulary builder. All words you search in the dictionary are store and every now and then you can pop over to see how many words you remember. Searching a word in the dictionary is also easy, just tap it. Setup is quick, weight feels just right and the home menu has the perfect design."",Great way to read your books on the go";;;;;;

This is a great kindle - do wish it lit up, but I knew it didn't when I bought it and the price was perfect, so no issues there.I recommend this for the younger kids especially to keep inappropriate apps out of their lives.

I repeat there is no built in light, you don't need it, now if you had to read at night with the lights off than you can buy a light or you could get a case with a built in light of you want to spend an extra $40.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I've been hearing a lot of comments about the Kindle from my friends and family. I was finally convinced on buying one for myself. I was a bit skeptical about it at first, being the kind of reader who prefers the actual book in hand be it soft or hard cover, but my view changed when my first Kindle came in the mail and tested it out.I have had this for almost three weeks now, and I am happy to say that I am glad that I bought it. It is easy to use, allows me to log onto Amazon to browse through a selection of books and I am by far loving the Kindle Unlimited. It also saves me room in my bag for when I need something to do to pass time while out of the house and it's light too.Being a new Kindle user, there were a lot of functions that were strange to me, but eventually got the hang of it as this Kindle has no actual page turning button as I thought it would.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I have owned several Kindles over the past few years, most of which I have given to friends and family.  Recently, I realized I had given away my last Kindle Paperwhite to a friend, so back to Amazon I went to get another.  When i saw this particular model on sale, I bought it immediately.  It arrived well packaged and two days sooner than predicted.Now I've read a couple of reviews where people had trouble switching the language when the Kindle first arrived.  Charge it up first. I had the same trouble before I had the forehead smacking moment of """"Duh"""", you need to charge it first.  Once done, I had no trouble.My only complaint and it's not even really that, is that this particular model is not back lit.  No real issue there as I have a clip on book reading lamp that works perfectly well for night time reading.My greatest love of this model is that it is so very light!  I love that it doesn't hurt my hands to hold it for long periods of time.  This Kindle is perfect for those who travel quite a bit and do not want to be carrying a heavier Kindle along.  It's also perfect for those who have trouble holding a book for long periods of reading.So remember, if you want an e-reader that is light weight and easy to use, I highly recommend this model.

"4.0 out of 5 stars,""I bought a 5th generation Kindle back in May.  It was my first e-reader.  I liked it a lot.  Then I saw that the Kindle was being offered in a touchscreen.  I thought """"I just bought a Kindle! I don't need to buy the newest model.""""  The price was $79.00.  (I only spent $49.00 on my first Kindle)  I then realized that I could trade in my old Kindle and get a gift card.  I then saw the touch-screen Kindle was being offered for $49.00 on Black Friday.  I could not pass this up.  I got my new  Kindle last week and I love it!The touch-screen did take a little bit of getting used to.  After a day of use, I found I liked the touch screen better than the page turn buttons.  I found highlighting to be a lot easier.  This kindle actually highlights the passage instead of underline.I love the new features on the Touch screen Kindle.  I love having Goodreads right there on the menu.  I use Goodreads all the time and it is much easier to update what books I am reading.  I really love the Page Flip feature so that I can go anywhere in the book and not have to constantly turn the page and lose my place.  The new """"about this book feature"""" is great since you can mark the book """"currently reading"""" on Goodreads.  It also tells you if the book is part of a series.  X-ray this book is a good feature because you can go to the dictionary and Wikipedia without leaving the book.  The Touch keyboard is a lot easier to use than the old Kindle.  Writing notes is a lot easier.I had very few problems with the Touch screen Kindle.  The main problem was getting all my books transferred onto it.  I had some books on my old Kindle that I transferred with a USB cable, so they were not on the Cloud. I could not open the books so,  I ended up having to re-buy two books.  The """"Cloud"""" and the """"Device"""" sections took some getting used to.  I have a lot of books I borrow from the library and they show up on the Cloud.  Some books have the loan ended, so I had to make an """"archive"""" collection.I wish the Touch Screen Kindle had more font choices.  On the old Kindle you had a lot more choices.  I like Times New Roman san serif.  I like the plainness of it.I am very satisfied with my touch screen Kindle, for now.  (I might in the future trade it in for a Kindle Fire)"",The new Kindle is awesome!";;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I have had a kindle for about 4-5 years, the one with the keyboard. I love it and was very reluctant to switch to this new touch screen kindle. It went on sale and a friend had decided to get it for me for my birthday. I have to say, I did not want it, I was happy with what I had. However, after I used it I was in love. The things you can do on this amaze me. You can look everything up while in text. I can see the characters and read about them and as a history guy it helps that I can look things up via wikipedia right on the ereader.

"4.0 out of 5 stars,""I've had this version for 2 weeks now.  Still on the initial charge on battery. A bit different than the PaperWhite, but the OS is the latest 5.6.2.1I personally chose the smallest Helvetica font with the least amount of margins.  I don't have to flip the pages as often.  The screen is crisp clear.  Yes, if you get close enough you can see the pixels of the fonts, and it's not perfect. If pixels bother you, you may want to consider the new Voyage which has a 300 dpi resolution.  Storage has been upgraded to 4 GB, but the OS takes up 0.9 GB.  I have 3.1 GB of available storage when it arrived.  I have about 60 books and 10 PDF's which takes up about 1.2 GB.  I don't think the Kindle can store thousands of books as Amazon claims.  It's more like hundreds of books.  But, propaganda sells.  I bought one and you may want to."",Must have for the avid (and casual) reader...";;;;;;
"4.0 out of 5 stars,""This version of the Kindle is truly glare free, and the touchscreen makes it very easy to maneuver through any book.While I still enjoy the tactile feeling of holding a traditional book, I admit that this device made reading on a plane, in bed late at night, and on the beach much easier. My only complaint was that it can't be read at night without a light- found this out on a late night flight when I was unable to sleep.

It doesn't include a wall charge but you really don't need one considering you barely ever charge it.  Overall very happy with it, no more paper for me."",""Great simple device, no more paper books for me""";;;;;;
"2.0 out of 5 stars,""Just bought my third Kindle, and am very disappointed that touchscreen versions are the only choices available. I was happy with both of my previous versions, and was fine with the earlier upgrade (a toggle switch instead of keyboard). But the touchscreen is making me crazy. I have a touchscreen laptop and smartphone, so it's not that I am against touchscreens in general. I just hate it on the Kindle. With the way it fits in my hand, my fingers often slide onto the screen a little too far and boom, I'm on a different article or chapter. PLEASE, Amazon, bring back some version without a touchscreen. The only plus is that the print quality is sharper than ever. I am glad that there is still an option without the paperwhite lighted screen as I much prefer this unlit screen option."",PLEASE bring back a non-touchscreen option!";;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""This is my first kindle. Prior to using a kindle, I read all of my digital goodies on an ipad, and, as much as I enjoy using my ipad, it is not exactly the most comfortable device to use for reading digital articles and ebooks. The kindle screen does not strain your eyes the way an ipad or computer screen would after reading incessantly for hours. It is also much more ergonomic. It is lighter and fits comfortably in one's palms. Moreover, the battery lasts forever. All in all, it is a much more comfortable and convenient device for those who like to read--which makes sense since that is the sole function this machine was designed to serve."",First time kindle user";;;;;;

Now, however, I cannot figure out how to transfer the many books that I have purchased to my new Kindle.  It says I have only 4 books.  I have always been very happy with past Kindles, and I would love to find this one as useful as others I own.

I wasn't sure that I would like the screen but it reads like a book and does not make my eyes tired.  I have only downloaded two books so far but I am very happy with the results.  One thing that I was not aware of is that it is in black and white.  If you are downloading something that is in color, like beading books, color is very important.  I got the app and downloaded the beading book in color on my tablet.  I am really looking forward to taking the kindle on vacation.  Once the book is downloaded, wi-fi isn't neccessary.

I debated the paperwhite but I don't read too often at night and if I ever do I could use the kindle app on my phone. For me being on a tight budget, this device is very good. I think I even like it better than the Keyboard. Occasionally I have very slight problems seeing the page in dim light but mostly it's very crisp.

"4.0 out of 5 stars,""I have to say I am not a big fan of touch screens & I was disappointed the previous generation kindle (with the buttons) wasn't available & this one was its' replacement. But the touch screen on this kindle is great & very responsive. My previous e-reader was a Kobo touch & this new Kindle is far more responsive than my old Kobo was. It is a joy to use & it will turn on & be ready to use within in 1-2 seconds, my previous e-reader took maybe 30 seconds to get the point where I could start reading. The plastic body does feel a little cheap and clunky but for reading purposes I would say it is great & worth the money."",Simple to use ... responsive touch screen";;;;;;
"4.0 out of 5 stars,""This is a really solid Kindle that provides great value for the price. My wife has an old school Kindle, the kind with the keyboard built into the body and the arrow buttons to move around. Oh my is that version incredibly difficult to navigate. So it's clear the Kindle has improved considerably from older models. The only real downside to this model is you cannot read when the lighting is low but it's a trade-off I will gladly accept for the great price.If you aren't looking for all the bells and whistles and are fine with a bare bones Kindle this is a great choice."",Great Kindle for the price";;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I read a lot. I use to like carry 3 or 4 books with me to work, just not knowing what mood I would be in during lunch. This has saved my sanity and my back. It took a while to become adjusted to the idea of buying digital copies of books. When I got over that, I did spend a bit of money to get my favorite reads on the Kindle and reread them all again, and because the Kindle is so comfortable, it was like reading them as a fresh experience.This coupled with Kindle Unlimited has saved me time and gas, as I'm no longer at the public library every week."",I use to like carry 3 or 4 books with me to work";;;;;;

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""so my reason for getting a kindle is simply to be able to read computer based books without straining my eyes. computer screens really hurt my eyes especially when I'm focused on them for a long period of time to do things like read a book.in that mark the kindle is stellar. the kindle is really soft on my eyes making it easy to read for hours. the screen is similar to one of those old pda screens which is nice because there is no glare. you can easily download your kindle library and do not need to be connected to the internet to use the dictionary and some of the other features. it does what its supposed to do extremely well. As far as the programming goes, it gets a little getting used to and inst the most genius layout. the main problem is the texts changing sizes when its brushed against, i really wish there was a lock for that. also the constant bombardment of adds is also unfortunate. also if you have big fingers, it will be difficult to learn how to press the menu button and not the top row of words. however it serves its purpose well and I highly recommend it as a cheep solution to read computer based books."",kindle is really soft on my eyes making it easy to read for hours";;;;;;

I also bought it to see how it works because I am a writer who will be self-publishing soon, and I wanted to see how the user would be reading my book when it's published. So here are the pros. It's a good size. Feels like a small trade paperback in my hands. It can hold a lot of books. I already have over 100 downloaded onto it. Most were free to download by the way. So here's the cons. It's dimly lit, and there's no way to adjust the brightness from what I can find. So if I want to read my Kindle device in the dark it's tough nuggets. Everything is in black and white. So no way to see the color(s) on a book cover. I am sure higher priced Kindles are vastly superior, and probably fix all the cons I mentioned, but I think that those features should just be basic on ALL Kindles, and not just the higher ones--if those features are there to begin with.

"4.0 out of 5 stars,""I read lots of reviews before buying this kindle. Seems like people who have owned prior versions of the kindle do not like this newer version as much as those of us new to Kindle. But I am a first time kindle user and I am very fond of it. I am very farsighted, so reading regular books can be rough (even with glasses). The screen on this is very easy on the eyes and I love the fact that I can enlarge the print. The battery lasts weeks on a charge. The only real issues I have with it are that the touch screen is sometimes slow to respond, and learning to navigate a book in digital format. One quick note, when you buy accessories make sure you get accessories made for the """"All New Kindle"""" and/or """"2014 Version"""". I bought a very nice case that did not fit, lesson learned."",First Time Kindle user and I am hooked";;;;;;
"3.0 out of 5 stars,""I might be a little biased because mine was broken. It never would charge properly. It was constantly dying.

"3.0 out of 5 stars,""I bought this because I cracked the screen on my previous kindle (my fault).  I was surprised that this new model was heavier and bulkier than my older kindle from years back.  I suppose it's to squeeze in the touch technology.  The touch technology is not bad. Though, I do miss the lighter and thinner kindle I used to own. But, otherwise, I use my kindle a lot and I like it."",Good but surprisingly thicker/heavier than my older version.";;;;;;

"4.0 out of 5 stars,""I can't give this neat little device 5 stars.  I just can't do it.  It works good enough to do the job, but I'm not blown away.  I really expected the screen to be more white, not so off-white, but it is still very readable in good lighting, which is what it is designed for.  I probably would have wanted the Paperwhite model, but I really liked the discounted price on Prime Day, so I can live with it.  The touch screen seems overly sensitive to me and I frequently turn multiple pages by accident and have to find my way back.  I may have to try a stylus.  It also seems slow and laggy to respond for everything but page turns.  Once again, I bought the cheapest one, so I can live with it.  Other than those little issues, it's a really nice little reader and does everything automatically like downloading and such.  I like it, but not 5 stars worth."",Not bad for the price.";;;;;;
"3.0 out of 5 stars,""I was much happier with the previous version.I like the touchscreen in theory but this one is not great. The font and text size change every time I put it down. Very irritating. It needs a lock of some sort. I wish you could set your own gestures. The ones it uses are strange and awkward. I have to use both hands to turn a page. That's silly.I can choose to read in landscape orientation but only on one side, I'd much prefer the other one, and it switches back to portrait when you go to the menu and other areas. I find it harder to hold in portrait as it becomes top heavy. I really hate that. Hate it.I'm a bit of a Wordy. I like reading the dictionary. I was really looking forward to the Word Wise (and Vocabulary Builder) feature but found it to be something for children or for people who are still learning the language. The first time I actually came across a word I needed a definition for, it didn't have one.

It's smaller and lighter and actually fits in my pocketbook, without a problem!  I got it on sale for $40 and am tickled pink with it!

Again, I loved the tablet, but portability was an issue";" it was too big to take with me to the store while waiting for my wife - whose """"I just need a couple of things"""" usually means hours.  So last month, when the price came down dramatically, I decided to splurge on this entry-level Kindle, just for reading purposes.  I absolutely love it.  No, it can't do all the things my tablet can do, but then again, neither can my tablet when it doesn't have a wi-fi connection.  It's small, light, and easy to carry in my pocket.  As far as the touch screen that many are complaining about, I have no issue with it, given that I had to swipe to read on my tablet.  While travelling for Christmas, I loved the no-glare screen for reading in the car.

"4.0 out of 5 stars,""I had some problems with this kindle as described on my previous review copied bellow, but the excellent Amazon customer service promptly contacted me and proposed me a solution, which was updating the kindle software, or replacing the device as last resource. I have been using this kindle for a few days after the update and now it works like a charm. I am giving 4 starts to this kindle, and 6 stars for the excellent customer service.If you don't care about having an integrated service with Goodreads, I would still recommend the previous kindle 4th generation because is thinner, lighter, and aesthetically more beautiful. Nevertheless being able to access Goodreads on your kindle is perfect, and if you care about that I would definitely recommend this Kindle 6"""" Touchscreen.-----------------------------------------I was reluctant to upgrade my old kindle because it worked great for me. However the integration with Goodreads was something that I wanted and since it is unlikely that Amazon will release a firmware upgrade for old kindles, I decided to give this new model a chance. I have to say that I am frustrated with my decision, and I still read most of my ebook on my good old kindle.Cons:- Sometimes the touch screen stays active for few seconds even after kindle is put to sleep. Because of that my books are frequently in different pages when I turn back on, and it is a pain to find back the right page.- When I am reading in the airplane mode to save some battery, errors appears in the middle of the reading saying that it couldn't find network connection. I have to turn some pages back and forth to make the message disappear and when it does, sometimes it skips randomly a few pages or a whole chapter and it is again a pain to find back the right page.- The touch screen was not designed for left handed people.- The software that runs on this kindle feels like horrible.Pros:- Integrated with Goodreads.The previous kindle fourth generation is simpler but very well designed. This new one sounds cool in theory, but they did a nice job in ruining the reading experience, besides making the device thicker, heavier, and less attractive aesthetically speaking."",""Problem Solved, Thanks Amazon!""";;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""This is my 5th Kindle device, although only 4 are still working.  This one is a completely different type.  More like a tablet or I-Pad.  It is touch sensitive.  To turn the page, you sweep your finger across it instead of pushing a bar.  To me, that is more labor intensive but I don't think it's supposed to be.  You tap the screen in various areas to bring up menus.  It's harder, to me, to create and fill collections than on the other type, but one can get used to almost everything, I suppose.  The fact that you can load so many more books on it is a high plus in its favor.  I'm not sorry I bought this at all.  I'm still in love with the technology of e-books!"",""Not like previous generations";" some better, some worse""";;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I love it. If I can't have a  book in my hands this the next best thing. My buddy has the kindle w/back light and it is also great. I read in in areas that are lite ( lamp inside or  natural sun light outside). I can download an eBook in less than a minute. When traveling I can download several books to take with me. Now if I read more in darker areas or in bed I would have gotten kindle with the back light. The battery last quite a bit longer on mine than my buddy's with the extra usage of the light.....so each to their own. One last thought is that when reading from a book the print size is what it is, but the kindle allows several different print sizes. Easy swipe of screen (like a phone) to next page or back. You can hold your finger down on a word for a definition. Back to traveling, the convenience of carrying several book in a small device is wonderful. When reading just tap the top of screen you will be offered several options. What ever page you are on you can return to home page and choose a different book without loosing page you were on from previous book or books. Times I read more then one book or one book is poems that I might want to go back to. Another good option is the ability to select chapters."",I love it. If I can't have a book in ...";;;;;;

5.0 out of 5 stars,High quality and durable feeling.  Easy to use. Though every now and again I do activate the wrong action when touching the screen.

"4.0 out of 5 stars,""This item definitely does what it says. It allows you to read books without carrying books with you. It isn't built to do anything else but it does that one thing really well.This version is the lowest tier of Kindle available. It has none of the bells and whistles, like 3G access to the internet or a backlight or a high definition screen. However, if you load on a bunch of books (and it will hold lots and lots of books), you don't need the 3G even when you can't find a wifi signal. It has it's own dictionary so you can still look up words even without wireless signal. It is light, and easy to hold, and the user interface feels very intuitive to me. Without a backlit screen you do need a decent light source to read, but then, so do books. The screen is clear and readable, and I appreciate being able to make the text different sizes.Yes, the screen savers on this device are advertisements. There are no ads while you are actually reading, and hey, you might find a new book or two that you would love, that you wouldn't have heard of otherwise. So far the ads seem pretty unobtrusive to me, but if you don't like them you can pay a fee and Amazon will turn them off for you, which seems reasonable, especially as it's only a one time fee, not an ongoing charge. My old 3rd gen Kindle has a finite number of screen savers and you can't change them, so this is at least different.Overall, for the price I paid, given that I can't afford the paperwhite or the voyager, this is a good reading device with a good screen that is easy to use but isn't full of the fun bells and whistles that come if you can invest more money into your electronics."",like 3G access to the internet or a backlight or ...";;;;;;
5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought 2 of these for my grandkids for Christmas. They are exactly as described.

"3.0 out of 5 stars,""Cons: I had a Kindle Keyboard for years, but someone stepped on it and the screen cracked. It like it was time to upgrade to the new version. To me, my old one seemed like the perfect size/shape for an e-reader. I used it all the time and it was comfortable to hold and read on. This one is smaller and the housing feels cheaper. I know I just bought the glare free version & not the version that has a reading light, but my last one you could at least adjust the contrast of the screen. The text cannot be adjusted to be darker on this one.Pros: It functions well, looks clean, is fast and holds a lot of books. The battery life is truly impressive. The ability to sync directly to Goodreads is fantastic.Overall: I'm just not as excited about picking this up to read on as I was about my last kindle simply for the way it feels in my hands.

"4.0 out of 5 stars,""I'll admit, I'm one of those who didn't clearly understand that Amazon was still producing """"paperwhites"""" and regular """"kindles"""" - I thought kindles had evolved to the point where they were all using """"paperwhite"""" technology, and that only the older models weren't paperwhites.  I already owned a paperwhite that I bought last year, but recently gave it to my wife, so I was looking for a second one.  When I saw that this was """"latest generation"""", I assumed that it had all the latest features (including the backlight), and chalked the lower price up to the fact that it was refurbished.  I'm not sure the lack of a backlight option would have been a dealbreaker, but I wish I had known at the time.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""Bought for my 9 year old to encourage him to read.  It's working!! According to him, reading kindle books on iPad mini,  it was too tempting to play a game or get distracted.

Only thing I don't like is that really inappropriate books are advertised on the """"off"""" screen.  Not happy about words like """"murder"""" appearing every time he picks the thing up.

I wish the cover would unlock the device when opened, but it's just a quick swipe.  I can tell from other reviews that they haven't read the description of what this does and the same goes with cases - though trying to figure out which one to order was tricky, so I am glad I found the correct case at a store (for cheaper than on the Amazon site, plus I don't have prime, so the $35 free shipping limit wouldn't have helped much).

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""The Kindle Touch (7th Gen/2014) is my first e-reader ever. I've been thinking of getting one for a while since reading off a tablet or even a LCD screen (anything backlit) is very fatiguing on the eyes.  My eyes feel extremely tired and dry after any such reading session. Another big reason for my purchase is two books that I wanted to buy were about $25 each while the Kindle versions were $10. A great incentive to finally take the plunge! Right there was a savings of $30. It's the same for other books with varying degrees of cost-saving.On to this one. I considered either this or the Paperwhite and eventually went with the touch to save the $40. Upon opening the box and slipping the Kindle out of its plastic case, I wanted to remove the sticker stuck across the screen, but lo and behold, it was the actual screen. Amazing. The text on this reader looks exactly like a printed page. - actually better. Specifications say that the Paperwhite is a higher resolution but let me tell you, I cannot imagine text being any more crisp than this. At least I doubt that the human eye can really differentiate it.It's a real plus to be able to set the text size to what you desire. I imagine this is a big plus to older people who are getting in the reading glasses zone. The only thing I would say is that the software could be a bit better in this regard -- the text size selection should stay with the book rather than be a system wide selection. Right now, if I change the font size it does it for all books - and for some reason different books have different default sizes.  In general the operating system is good but I imagine it can get a lot better.  One thing that is good is the ability to set up the Kindle for other users, i.e., """"freetime.""""  You can set up a freetime account (another user) on your Kindle and only add selected books to their library.  That way, you an keep more adult oriented books away from kids for instance.This Kindle requires light to read but that's not an issue for me.  It's just like a book - you need a light to read. So I'm either in a lit room or use my bedside lamp.I've had mine for about 10 days now and the battery is still at least 30% charged.  In these 10 days I have discovered a ton of free Kindle books - from racy novels to biographies to classics to a magic book!  It's really drawing me back in to reading. It's amazing to be able to have hundreds of books right in your hands.  There's no doubt that printing of books will be gone within the next generation - and with this wonderful device (screen technology) - I won't miss them.In summary, I would say that if the extra $40 is no problem, spring for the Paperwhite as having the lit screen (different from backlit screens) could be useful when reading in bed with someone else. All-in-all I have to say that this is easier on my eyes than any screen or even a regular book. And it is getting me back to the joys of reading! It's been a great purchase for me!!"",My first e-reader and it is awesome";;;;;;
"1.0 out of 5 stars,""I bought this. The package arrived timely and in good condition.  This review does not reflect negatively on MidContinent whom I have bought from before and look forward to purchasing through again.  This review is about the product--Kindle E-reader. When the Kindle arrived I discovered the usb cable was insufficient to properly charge the Kindle (per information supplied by Kindle) ,  so I purchased ac adapter for additional $20.00.  Then discovered, after charging the Kindle battery and reviewing the eoperator's manual,  I had to have WI-FI to link to computer.  I don't have WI-FI so I purchased a NETGEAR 23 USB WI-FI USB adapter for $30.00 to create linkage between my computer and the Kindle (supposedly cannot use the cable supplied with Kindle to download).  Then spent 3 hours on Amazon tech support and 6.5 hours trying to register Kindle (that according to Amazon was already registered because I am a customer) but the Kindle doesn't know that.  The WI-FI NETGEAR23 connection is listed on the WI-FI networks the Kindle can identify, but will not recognize any passwords to allow me to complete the registration process and enable use of the Kindle.  There is a workaround, I can use the enclosed cable and the Cloud, which I have never used, AND if I download one book the cost to use the cloud is $5.00 (that's the monthly minimum charge--supposedly the more I use the cloud, the less the pro rata charge up to a volume level of data whereat the charges increase). For my NOOK, there is no cost, no cloud involved.  Getting a Kindle up and running should not be this hard or costly to do.  The additional costs are not transparent to the purchaser.  The Kindle does not appear to have a way to back out of the registration process once one is into it to change passwords, user ID's, nor confirm same. Yesterday the Amazon tech spent 3 hours and we couldn't solve the problem. Today I called back and the Amazon tech was in a noisy boiler room and could not hear me, could not make her computer work, and being located OCONUS was having as many problems understanding my English as I was having understanding hers (she seemed like a nice person, but we didn't talk long).  I have a NOOK.  I have used it for years.  I wanted the Kindle to download ebooks that are not otherwise available.  I am frustrated, unhappy, and not a happy camper--but the world as I know it will go on.  No, I cannot get through or out of the registration loop on the Kindle";" I cannot download the Kindle ebooks, but at this point that is infinitely more easy to live with than fruitlessly trying to make the Kindle I bought operational."",""There are hidden costs, and no guarantee of successful useage""";;;;;

I'm talking about both the speediness of the device itself and overall usability";" typing text and selecting things both feel faster on the touchscreen interface than using the Kindle Keyboard's physical keys. In addition, because everything is done through the screen, I can usually touch the spot where I want to move the cursor instead of having to scroll to the location. The pages turn noticeably more quickly on this model than the Kindle Keyboard I had. Another thing I like is the feel of the device. This kindle is a little thicker than its keyboard predecessor, but it's also shorter, meaning holding it is even more similar to holding a small paperback book. This, combined with the nicely sized touchscreen and some of the touch gestures, makes one-handed navigation even easier. My only criticism is that the screen sometimes seems a little more sensitive than expected, causing unintentional page turns. This doesn't occur very frequently, however, and may be more due to me still getting used to the change in interacting with the device. Regardless, this can be alleviated by using a stylus, and the screen overall is well calibrated in my experience.As for the new features like Vocabulary Builder and integration with Goodreads, I don't currently use those much. However, I can see how they'd be useful especially in the case of studying and trying to get through difficult material, or if you had kids and wanted to encourage them to read more without having to buy a separate device. And if you never end up needing them, it isn't ridiculously hard to either ignore them or turn them off in the system settings.Overall, this was a very good purchase. Compared to the Kindle Keyboard, this model is faster and more comfortable to use. The extra features don't weigh it down, and the new design makes the reader less aware of the hardware and more aware of what's being read."",Another thing I like is the feel of the device";;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""Great product!I've never really been a big reader, and when this was on sale, I decided to buy it";" thinking it would encourage me to read more often.As soon as I got it I was able to get a Kindle First book, The Einstein Prophecy.I've been reading for about 5-6 hours a week since buying the kindle.I like how you can read it outside, without much glare at all (compared to a cellphone or ipad).

5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this Kindle!  It does everything it is supposed to.  Which for me means being able to read my e-book in the sun.  Having it sync with my Kindle Fire means I can read the same book at night with no lights on which is good when my husband wants to sleep.

I got it mainly because some favorite authors have some short novels that are only available as e-books, but I am acquiring quite a few interesting books to read.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I recently purchased the Amazon Kindle with a 6” touch-screen and Wi-Fi capabilities. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is a book lover or traveler. There are several features of the Kindle that I enjoy";" the glare-free screen, quick download times, battery life, and tools available while reading.The Kindle’s glare-free screen is great for reading outside on sunny days. Unlike the iPad, you don’t need to worry about a glare coming off the screen making it hard to read. However, should you want to used an iPad, all of your books are available using the Kindle app. Reading from the tablet instead of a book is also nice to have for beach reading. There is nothing worse than a book full of sand!I was shocked when my books downloaded so fast. They downloaded just as quickly any app would download on your phone. I found this very impressive considering how many GBs of space is used to download books to a device. The quick download speed really comes in handy if you are at an airport and want to buy a book before a flight. Keep in mind the Kindle has Wi-Fi access, not 3G. This means you must be in a location with Wi-Fi to purchase and download books.Nothing is more frustrating than needing to constantly be charging your electronic devices. You should be able to go a few days without needing to charge your Kindle. This depends, of course, on how much you use it during the day. When you travel, you may need to charge it more frequently than when you do not because you will be reading on it more. This is one of my favorite features as I find myself charging my iPhone and iPad at least once a day even when I’m not using them much throughout the day.Finally, there are some very helpful tools that can be used while reading. I find the dictionary to be very useful. Whenever you come across a word that you do not know, you can highlight it and look it up right then. Along with this, there is a highlighting tool. You can highlight passages in the book you are reading and what other readers highlighted as well.I give this product 5 stars and I hope my fellow book lovers find this product as great as I do!"",Great Product for Book Lovers";;;;;

"4.0 out of 5 stars,""Great eReader. You see all the hype on other eReaders that make you wonder what the difference between it and a tablet is. I don't need to access the Internet and other crazy things from my book. I wanted my reader to be exactly like a book, which it is. The only """"fancy"""" thing with this reader is that it does have a dictionary, Xray, and wiki. Xray let's you look deeper into the book, if it is supported. It does have Goodreads integrated, so you can add the book to a shelf and give it a star rating (though I haven't figured out if you can update your progress or not, only had it for a week so far). It does not have actual internet, no backlighting, and no page-turning buttons. It is lighweight, about the size of a paperback book. I have actually caught myself grabbing the top corner as if I were going to turn the page! This is an awesome basic eReader. If you tend to read in bed like I do, buy a book light to go with it. I would recommend this to every avid reader."",Great eReader for paperbook lovers";;;;;;
"3.0 out of 5 stars,""My rating is heavily influenced by my expectation that this would be a step up from my Kindle Keyboard (which died at 5 years of age). The new Kindle is not as comfortable in the hand, I just don't love the touch screen, and it is ONLY for reading. I actually find the touch screen kind of annoying (personal preference). Also on the negative side (and a warning to other buyers), if you enjoy Active Content - you won't be able to use it on this device. I played """"Every Word"""" pretty much every day on my Kindle Keyboard. Received a Paperwhite as a gift and discovered Active Content is not compatible. After a lengthy phone call and being assured by an Amazon """"Kindle Expert"""" that I could play the game on this model, I exchanged the Paperwhite. Active Content is NOT compatible with this model - I don't know why their """"expert"""" assured me it was. It's another annoyance and it seems kind of stupid that Amazon would take away the ability to use their own material. The only way you can use active content now is on certain Kindle models only available through third-party sellers. On the plus side the screen is easy to read for anyone who has eye issues with back-lit devices. This is a nice, non-glare reading experience. There are different fonts and sizes to choose from. This is the first time I have been so seriously disappointed with a buying experience from Amazon, and it's really left a bad impression. The Paperwhite was given as a thoughtful gift to replace my beloved Keyboard";" however, the gift giver wanted me to be able to play my game AND read, so encouraged me to call to arrange an exchange for one that would do what I wanted. I made the decision to replace it with this model on the advice of an expert who apparently wasn't, I was disappointed again. So, all in all, if you only want to read, and can't take LED or backlit screens, this is an OK tool for those purposes. As a PS: Why was the Keyboard eliminated (some people liked it)? Repair services would have been a great option, also. I'm sure there are others out there who don't feel the newer models are all an improvement."",For Reading Only";;;;;
"1.0 out of 5 stars,""Be careful. I ordered a kindle whose description was """"Certified Refurbished Kindle with Special Offers (Current Generation).""""

Turned out, when I asked customer service what the issue was, that they checked the serial number and it was a 2nd generation, even though that is not what was advertised. I paid about $65 for it, and the brand new 7th gen is about $79. Seems a small discount for a give generation difference.

I live on a sailboat, so it's great to be able to have lots of books without having to have a place to store hard copies.  Things I don't like - 1. The battery charge does not last for weeks.  I'd say perhaps 8-10 hours.  2. It takes a long time to for it to charge - most of a day.  3. It's a bit hard to find a place to hold it so I don't touch the screen and change pages. 4. Wish it just had a list of my books, rather than the actual book covers. I have to scroll though many pages just to find a book.  Also, you have to enter the page number of the book list - would be better if you could just touch/swipe to get to the next page.  5. Hate the underlining/highlighting of passages that I assume was made by other readers.  I don't underline/highlight, yet many of the new books I get already have that. 6. Hate that the screen spontaneously comes on with some suggested book.  I think that is part of the problem with it using the charge up so fast. I find it with the screen on with a suggested book.  7.

"2.0 out of 5 stars,""One of the best things about the Kindles has been the simple yet addictive word games. Games like Every Word, Every Word Crossing, etc., were free, fabulous, and used by me daily. There is no mention of the fact that they've discontinued all active content (!) in the latest Paperwhite, but let me assure you, it's gone.Not only that, but the screen IMO is a step back from the 6th edition, which I loved. Sadly I lost mine in an airport and had to get a 7th gen to replace it. When the first Paperwhite came out it had terrible mottled lighting on the bottom, but they fixed that in the 6th edition (yay!). Well, it's back in the 7th edition. In addition, the screen is less responsive, the lighting isn't as good, and it's just not as easy to read, regardless of what Amazon's marketing may say.I've loved every kindle I've had until now. Sadly this """"upgrade"""" really feels like a letdown. I'm sure they'll come out with an 8th edition so they can get people like me to spend another $120. Sigh...Amazon: Bring back active content and stop mucking with the screen!Update: January 2016. My Kindle has started acting wonky. Now, when I tap for a page turn, it sometimes takes over two seconds to turn the page. I've rebooted to no avail. It still functions, but now the distraction is breaking my revery from whatever I'm reading. I've docked another star because this has become a huge disappointment. Honestly the best thing about this Kindle is the cool leather case I bought for it. I'm considering following a commenter's advice and buying a used older one."",Does not support games!";;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""i love this! really do not understand all the negative reviews. anti glare is perfect, the dialogue part is nice and dark so you can read it . you can adjust the lettering to your liking, its stays charged it seems like forever. lightweight, you can hold it in one hand, pages turn with a touch of a finger- that is the best! i still have my old one ( its like 4 years old now) with the side buttons and always disliked it  this one is 100% better to read with trust me.."",love this kindle!!";;;;;;

5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this for my 21  year old daughter that's going through some medical issues that require a lot of appointments and waiting. She's an avid reader and Kindle is a great way to take advantage of our prime membership and save money on books. As stated it is a smaller model. That's what she needs to toss in a bag or purse.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I love this as its so light to hold.  Anyone with arthritic pains in your fingers or wrist will appreciate it.  its a little different from the regular one as it has no backlight, so in the evening must be read under a light.

"4.0 out of 5 stars,""Bought the entry level Kindle when it was on sale. I wasn't sure I'd like a """"reading"""" only device, but I hate reading on the iPhone (too small a screen) and didn't want to lug around a heavier tablet AND my iPhone. Besides the heavier tablet would aggravate my carpal tunnel (just holding a book or newspaper does, so I knew the extra weight would be taxing). I've used an iPad several times and frankly don't find them all that useful - for me. But the Kindle seems to suit me.I ride the subways of NYC to get to and from work and find that the Kindle is very easy to use, light-weight and doesn't bother my hands.

Very easy to use & user friendly.  No, it's not designed for color printed graphic novels or comic books but for reading books it's great.

"4.0 out of 5 stars,""Purchased it during Black Friday deal. Had kindle touch & new kindle paperwhite. So, compared to the previous ones I had, I think this is by far the best value deal. The resolution isn't so bad for reading and the processing speed has gotten faster than kindle touch. I also like the squarely simple design, which, in my opinion, is much better to grip.For $49, I believe I'm getting the best reading experience I ca get.One drawback, though, is that the touch screen is infrared style. Durning normal reading time, it doesn't make any difference, but when putting down the device beside the pillow after reading, with a just a touch from the blanket or my hair causes the screen to turn the page or change the font size. Even when I cover the screen with a cloth or a paper to protect from screen damage, it senses touch and responses to it. Quite annoying especially when using kindle (this one) after being used to the touch style of paperwhite. So, that's one star off.But for those who wants simple reading device, this is THE IT."",""Love the price, functionality, and speed.

When you've been reading real books as long as I have you wonder how a little etch a sketch wannabe could take the place of an actual paper book. Well I've had time to do some reading on it and I have to admit it's pretty neat. I am alternating now between real books and my Kindle. I can't imagine ever giving up real paper books but who knows?

I would prefer not to have the ads, but since they are only visable when in standby mode or on the home page, I can live with that.

"3.0 out of 5 stars,""Great reading tool, the best out there. Major issue I have is with my home Wi-Fi. It is a hit and miss connection. In a good days it will connect to my network in about 2-3 seconds after I turn it on. On a bad day it will not connect at all (such as the case while I'm writing this). Initially I've purchased 2 of the basic kindles for Valentines Day for me and my wife. The Wi-Fi problems started with both devices on the first day. I've called customer service and was advised to update the software. I did the update, but that didn't help much as both devices were with on-off relationship with my home network. From there I've spent countless hours on the phone during the next couple of days with customer service training to fix the problem. The last time I've spoken with them, I was instructed to use a specific code on the device which pulled up all the recorded data for the device, including any issues with the Wi-FI. I was able to forward this data to the technician, who told me that once reviewed, he will call me and let me know how to proceed. That was about a month ago and I'm still waiting. Meanwhile I decided the problem is within the model itself, so I've ordered 2 new devices of the more advanced Paperwhite version and returned the other two. The problem has appeared on both new devices again couple of hours after I've opened the boxes. I have not called customer service again on the new devices. The reason is that I'm tired of spending time on the phone explaining what is the problem and begging for help. (On the good side, I now know my 10 digit Wifi password given to me from FIOS and can tell it without looking). It seems that every time I call, the rep has a quick fix to connect me to my Wifi which works for couple of hours may be. After that we are back to hit and miss. I now know how to connect the devices to the Wifi: Restart my router and restart the device (there are days that even that do not work....but there is always tomorrow). However, I don't see this as a particularly convenient way.This should not be an issue for a device of such level. Bottom line: I'm keeping the devices, as I really enjoying them as readers (my wife doesn't care about the Wifi as many people probably don't) even with the Wifi issue in hopes that the next update will fix the issue."",Great reading device.

"4.0 out of 5 stars,""I put this Kindle side by side with the Paperwhite.  In good lighting, the brightness of the screens are fairly identical as the Paperwhite adjusts to the light within your environment (the darker the room, the more prominent the light). I do like to read in bed and find that lamp light is sufficient when using this Kindle.  However, I must admit that the backlight on the Paperwhite is a nice feature and very convenient.  I got this Kindle around Valentine's Day on sale for $59.99 and there's no way I'm returning it unless it malfunctions.  I'll purchase a book light and use it as a backup reader if nothing else.  On the mechanical side, its very sensitive and at times skips a few pages when I tap to advance to the next page.  From reviews of the Paperwhite (which was $99.99 at the time of my purchase of this Kindle), the Paperwhite has the same issue. It's a little frustrating trying to get back to your place in the book.  Overall, this Kindle is a good e-reader.  I recommend that you really evaluate your reading habits before you purchase this Kindle. If you're used to holding a physical book, then there's not much difference here. Just adjust the light in your environment as usual.  It's lightweight, easy to transport, and has every feature the Paperwhite offers, with the exception of the backlight and the higher price tag.  Its also easy on the eyes, especially for someone who sits in front of bright computer screen all day and desire to give their eyes a break. Overall, I give this Kindle 4 Stars.

"2.0 out of 5 stars,""I got Kindle because it has better support for reading other languages than nook (older touchscreen version).  I haven't found the reader to my liking when comparing it my Nook so far.  In fact, I get frustrated with Kindle on its usability.Pros:- It has more support for non-English (or Western European languages).- Has multiple dictionary for English as well as other languages to choose from.- Vocabulary builder.Cons:- Not even used for more than a couple of weeks, it froze on me.  I had to restart the system.  I also lost last read page of my book!!!- Home page doesn't allow me to go back to my previously read book without searching the book again.  Whenever I navigate say to my cloud or goodread, I have to use so many back button to get to where I left off.  I would think going to the home page would allow me to go back to my book with fewer clicks, but no.- Dictionary search limitations  - Words with dashes or other punctuation are hard to search.  There's no custom highlight to search words in dictionary.  - Sometimes I need to look up words in dictionary definition too, but I can't do that.  Nook has it and I really like the feature where I can search dictionary of words that I don't know everywhere, not just the words in the book.  - Custom search.  Sometimes, the words you search are not available in regular dictionary OR wikipedia, but if you modify the search word a little bit, it can help.  But user cannot edit the search word.  Again, this is something Nook has and I find it very convenient.- Can't disable wi-fi without going into settings with multiple clicks away from your book.  Then have make more clicks to find your way back to the book...Overall, as a reader, it's not much different than other readers.  It can improve by increasing dpi, making text more clear, but other usability is very important too.  I personally find it hard to use.  The dictionary usage is very important for someone who is not a native English speaker and need to look up words in dictionary all the time.  Not only the highlighting is rigid, not user input to correct the selection and no option for user to search further on new words in definition, I simply find it extremely inconvenient.I don't think I will buy another Kindle in the future."",Don't like navigation usability";;;;;;

I never intended to use the Kindle to browse the web but I did want to be able to download books from the library using the Kindle. But the browser is so bad I have never been able to use it to browse and download library books. I have to use my computer or iPhone to get library books for the Kindle. I also wish a power adapter had been included because it is not convenient to charge it on USB. The $19.99 price Amazon charges to buy the power adapter is ridiculously high. The Kindle cover is also overpriced at $29.99. It feels very flimsy - a far cry from the nice leather cover the Kindle Gen 1 had.I bought the Kindle at the $99 price and the next day saw it went on sale for $79. I was happy that Amazon agreed to give me the sale price retroactively. I've seen the Kindle on sale more recently at $59 and wish that I had waited to buy it at that price.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I bought this for my neice this last christmas. Originally I was going to get the kindle fire. Her parents however, weren't comfortable with her having internet access and all that comes with it like the apps, social media and games. So i was quite happy when I found this. No, it isn't the fanciest high tech thing, but it does what it's supposed to very well. the touchscreen is very responsive and easy to navigate to where you want to go. It is a great e-reader, where you can purchase or borrow books. When a book is open the screen looks a lot like the page of a real book. What was a huge seller for me, and the reason for wanting to get my neice a kindle in the first place, was the built in dictionary. My neice can now read many books and have easy access to the definition of words she is unfamiliar with. This device has increased her desire to read and her vocabulary has improved. Now that I've seen this being used I'm glad I didn't get the fire. Without all the distraction from apps and games she is able to focus and immerse herself into whatever story she's reading.

I don't particularly like touching the screen to go from page to page. I liked the page turner on the hardware side of the Kindle instead. I don't really like the ability to put in a page number instead of hunting from page to page. I should be awing and ooohing at this technology, but I think it might have something to do with stopping to put in the page number which to me is a bit of a delay in this age of instant gratification.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I've had my Kindle for a couple of days now, and it has seen very heavy usage, but barely sipped at the batteries - I keep it in airplane mode for security and to preserve battery life. Though I'm still finding my way around the more advanced and difficult aspects of using the Kindle, using it for its basic functionality is very intuitive. I'm impressed by the eInk screen, with glare equivalent to a glossy magazine page, it's very readable in all light conditions.Its light weight and small size, and the lack of need to hold the pages open have made reading in bed much more comfortable than with conventional books - this is a big deal, coming from a paper book purist! Repetitive strain injuries have made reading a painful chore - not any more! Between this and the many free kindle books, both new and classic, I've been able to get back to reading as a hobby despite a low budget.I find the Special Offers unintrusive, similar to ads in a magazine, so for the cost conscious, it's not so bad to get the Special Offers edition."",Repetitive strain injury made reading a painful chore - not anymore!";;;;;;

Have already almost finished one of the books and the print is very clear and their is no glare on the screen.,Love it!;;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I purchased this within the past four months for myself, mainly to borrow eBooks from my local public library. I was hesitant to try an eReader because I much prefer physical books. However, I am very glad I made the decision I did. I read much faster on my Kindle than I do paper books. I am able to rent textbooks at a much lower cost (being a poor college kid is a struggle). I can even email myself PDF files of required readings from class to save myself from printing them all. It is very easy to sort all the PDFs into different collections for each course.I have two critiques. One is that Collections cannot be made within Collections (but I acknowledge that this is my over-organized brain seeking unreasonable requests). The other is that highlighting in PDFs is difficult. However, highlighting in a normal eBook is incredibly easy, even if the section I want to highlight runs over two pages.This is a very basic eReader without many bells and whistles, and it suits me just fine. Reading outside is not an issue, and reading under the covers with a flashlight poses no problem. I charge my Kindle once every two weeks with my frequent use, but it can go longer between charges. I would recommend this eReader to anyone new to the eBook game."",Very pleased";;;;;;

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I finally got an e-reader after considering it a few years, and I must say it's more than I'd hoped for! The text is dark and clear, the kindle itself is light and easy to carry around, and by far the best feature is one that isn't even advertised. There are no pages to close on you when you set it somewhere to read! After years of reading in odd positions and using anything nearby to weight down the pages, being able to just set the kindle down and keep reading is possibly the greatest change possible. The future is finally here, and my book doesn't try to close itself every time I shift around!I was a little worried about its PDF reading ability after doing extensive research, but after loading up a few from my computer I can say it's much easier to read them than on my computer screen. Just set it to landscape mode and you're set to go, which is a godsend since I've amassed more PDFs of programming books and other texts over the years than any human should, and sitting at a desk trying to read them has always led me to stop just a few dozen pages in never to return.Overall it's a great product, and I look forward to using it daily!"",Makes reading even easier";;;;;;

"4.0 out of 5 stars,""An excellent device that even skeptics will grow to love. I love the smell and feel of real books, but when I was on vacation, I spent a week with no internet connection nor cell phone signal and had to rely on my books to keep me company. During this stay, I had luckily preemptively downloaded a bunch of books to the device, and I plowed straight through 4 or 5 of them. This would not have been possible if I had to carry 4 or 5 books on every trip.As for the specifications on the device: I recommend splurging a bit to get the paperwhite, particularly if you like reading at dusk or while traveling. This version is pleasant while there's adequate light, but if there is inconsistent light, say from reading while on a train, you will become frustrated. The paperwhite with a backlight is much better in this regard. In addition, I do wish that it was a little bit larger, as I have to either hold it with two hands, or between my palm and my abductor pollucis (meat of the thumb) to balance it";" more non-screen space for leverage is welcome and would make reading upside down or at angles easier.My last quip about this device is that the exterior scratches fairly easily. I left my kindle in my backpack while traveling, but it suffered no huge distress and has little scratches that can be distracting from the page. Definitely recommend purchasing with a cover of some sort.The positives:I love the screen, it really does feel like paper, and there's about as much readable area as a normal book. Customizable fonts are nice, the area allocated to touch is nice, sensitivity is adequate, if a bit too much, and overall does its job well.The data transfer system is excellent, as I can download books, either from Amazon or through a third party service, and put them on the device via USB easily. The experimental browser and goodreads are nice bonuses that I don't really use, but you could. It's very easy to share books with friends/family as well.It's very light and pleasant to carry around, no matter how heavy the reading you're doing is.Great volume lets you read as many books as you want and you can set up a buffet of reading for whatever you're in the mood for, rather than being limited by what you have with you.Overall - Recommended, but consider the other models first to best match your needs."",An excellent device that even skeptics will grow to love";;;;;

"4.0 out of 5 stars,""I bought this to replace my trusty old original Kindle DX with the keyboard after the 5-way button on the DX suddenly broke. I was a little worried about how tiny the screen is, and on Day 2, I am finding it annoying to have to page turn so frequently, but I think eventually it will become second nature and the touch screen will be better than the klunkiness of all those buttons --  although after years with the DX the only time the buttons annoyed me was when typing in a search term or when I forgot I wasn't on my iPad and tried to scroll with my finger. I opted for the plain old Kindle vs moving up to a Paperwhite or Voyage because I stare at a computer monitor at work all day and usually spend an hour or two in the evening on the iPad, so I really didn't want another lighted screen. I use the Kindle almost exclusively to read in bed, where I have a lamp on the wall that shines over my shoulder. I am quite satisfied with the clarity of the text which is noticeably darker than the DX - so I am glad I didn't opt for the more expensive models simply for higher resolution, especially since I read a lot of complaints that the lighting in those models is not even, which would drive me nuts. I'm not entirely sure I made the right choice getting the """"Special Offers"""" version - I misread the description and thought the offers would only be on the sleep screen, not on the home screen too. One thing I will not miss about the Kindle DX is the bruises on the bridge of my nose from it bonking me when I fell asleep reading - I think the smaller lighter Kindle will be easier on my face."",I am finding it annoying to have to page turn so frequently";;;;;;

Not a huge deal, and not worth removing even a 1/4 of a star.I highly suggest this Kindle for anybody who wants an e-reader."",Fantastic Product";;;;;;

5.0 out of 5 stars,I was lucky enough to get this new kindle 2014 edition when it was on sale for$49. I love this kindle even though it doesn't have a light built in. It's really lightweight.

This is replacing my kindle keyboard which no longer keeps a charge in the battery.,love it;;;;;;

4.0 out of 5 stars,Simple straight forward way to read. The only thing lacking is adjustable screen lighting. The kindle reminds me of a basic car from the '60's.

Nor did you have to spend $800 for a slight bumper bump.,No need for bells and whistles.;;;;;;

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I have the very first Kindle and I'm going to keep it, but I did want something that had a touch screen.  For anyone who likes to read outside, this is what you want.  I have an iPad that I love but take it outside, or any where there is glare, and it is literally worthless.  This is also small and lightweight.  It's for readers like myself who go through a ton of books.  Again though, the biggest benefit is NO GLARE.  You can sit in full sun, and I live in Phoenix, and you can read just fine.  At night, I also use it in bed but you do need to have a light on, but personally I tried reading on devices that were backlit and they make me go bug eyed.  My eyes just get exhausted trying to read off iPads, or other devices that have the little TV screens.  This simple, basic, affordable Kindle is just right for those readers out there who just want to sit back and read and not get cramps in your hands because of the weight, or headaches because of the screen.

5.0 out of 5 stars,Great reader! These were gifted to my children (ages 10-11) and are quite user friendly. My two favorite features are the Kindle Free Time and the vocabulary builder.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I love books, I have always loved books. When the e-reader craze started I was horrified. I would never give up my precious bookswith their sound, their smell, their magic. But then I married a man who's job allowed him to travel. I realized touring my entire library across the country would be completely ridiculous, so I bought a kindle. I bought it solely for the sake of portability with the expectation of hating it for it's coldness, the coldness of technology. I was wrong. It reads wonderfully, the pages turn seamlessly. I forget sometimes while I'm reading that it isn't a book, it is the perfect size and weight and without a backlight it reads just like paper. There is no screen glare with the exception of a particular angle in direct sunlight which is easy enough to avoid. While I do believe I may just be falling in love with this little electronic device I am certainly not turning my back on """"real"""" books, I bought one just the other day in fact.

"3.0 out of 5 stars,""I have had an old Kindle Touch for sometime now so a new one was I order. I like this one but have a few things I would change:-They took away the home screen button from the front of the device. I really miss that.-I wish I didn't have to jump through so many hoops to turn off WiFi. There used to be an option for this in the menu but now you have to go through several steps to put it in airplane mode. Just a small annoyance...-It feels cheap. My old one had a coating on the back that made it non-slip and the edges were rounded which made it more comfortable to hold. This one is just slippery plastic and I don't like the beveled edges. It's like they are making it so you have to buy a case for it.Two annoying things that are true of all Kindle devices and apps are true of this one:-There is no way to stop items automatically downloading to the devices/apps. I buy a lot of free books and don't necessarily want them all downloaded automatically. That makes for a lot of items to wade through!-I wish there was a way to delete multiple items at once so when the above unwanted download occurs, I can quickly delete what I don't want.Other than those things, this Kindle is faster and the battery is better. I hope they improve on the next one!Update 5/19/15 - I am also now realizing that none of my Kindle Active Content will work on this Kindle and apparently has not worked on any Kindle since the original Kindle Touch.

The search function is fine if you remember the correct title or the author's name, but is confusing in the icons along the side of books.

"1.0 out of 5 stars,""Kindles have been a part of our lives since the first generation kindle reader.  My son and I are on our 6th kindle. Boy, was I a loyal fan. I'm a librarian and it changed the way we read books and lightened our load when we traveled. I probably sold hundreds to friends and family in those first five years just through my vocal enthusiasm for the device. I loved showing people how it worked. In addition, customer service would replace our broken kindles regularly for a small price and we could read and buy books weekly if not sometimes daily.  Fast forward ten years and I am so frustrated with kindles and Amazon.com. I quit Amazon Prime this year. I dislike the Kindle Touch reader because any slight touch to the screen gets me completely lost, (even my son, who never complains about anything, complains about this Kindle) and I detest the Kindle Fire because it stopped holding a charge after 12 months, so watching a movie is just a pain. I dislike reading books on the Fire";" the light bothers me. We've rented dozens of movies and lost at least half of them to that silly 24 hour expiration after you start. I'm sorry, but I can't stay awake at night to watch a whole film. It sometimes takes awhile and I need that option. Don't get me started on customer service. What used to be wonderful is now awful and time consuming. Not worth the hassle.  I've become quite soured on the whole business model. Plus, it doesn't help that the employees of Amazon work in harsh conditions with low pay. I've listened to a few programs on the radio and on television (I think one was 60 minutes) and the founder, Jeff Bezos, has come under some very harsh criticisms by book sellers, publishers and other small businesses competitors as well. The reviews on him are not complimentary.  My two cents: think through your purchases, estimate how much money you're going to spend in a year on Amazon products and if the Amazon Prime membership is worthwhile. Figure out how many hours of enjoyment you will get in return for that investment.  Is truly worth your money? I've thought it through, and for me, the answer is clearly no. I've been 8 months """"clean"""" now and I'm happy with my decision.  I've chosen to buy less and pay outright for each individual item I deem important enough to own or rent (and I still get consistently duped on those movie rentals!).

"4.0 out of 5 stars,""This is my first Kindle. As a busy college student, I bought this item for leisure reading in my free time.

I like the fact that it is easy on the eyes and relatively easy to navigate. I love the dictionary! I would not otherwise take the time to look up words I don't know. The fact that there is no backlight is no problem at all. If there is enough light in the room to read a book, then you read from the kindle. Actually, I think the kindle might be easier to read in low light than some books due to its bright background. The lack of back-light will be a deal breaker if you like to read in the dark. The special offers are not intrusive to me and occasionally some of them spark my interest. Overall, I like it. It is great for what I use it for. I would definitely make this purchase again.Nit Picks:1. I hate when dust gets on the screen, it makes it appear like pieces of the letters did not materialize. I got the amazon case to go with it and dust particles still get on the screen. Not a big deal though. Debris have a much more negative impact on e-ink screens.2. I wish there were instructions on all of the features on the kindle. There was a short tutorial upon set up, but I run across other features that I would like to know function of.3.  Because people can self-publish via amazon, there are a lot a crappy books out there for cheap/free, but don't be discouraged there are good ones too.4.

I  like that I can store hundreds of books on the device, so I can read several books without the cumbersome task of carrying multiple books. I also like the built in dictionary that enables you to look up a word within the book you are reading. The price for the device is great. Amazon makes this affordable for anyone.

By comparison, this one is larger but lighter.  It feels somewhat hollow in comparison to the PW2.  The PW2 also had a better feeling back on it.  One would think if they made a bigger Kindle with less in it, that the battery would be better.At the end of the day, yes you'll be able to use this as an e-reader.  Is it all that's promised, probably not.  Could it be made better (to be more on par with its predecessors), yes.  It is however cheaper than the predecessors so that explains a lot too.  For me, I'll probably use it just for traveling where books are more cumbersome or for when I'm reading fiction.  For more important items, I'll no doubt continue using physical books.In other words, I expected to love this device like my previous two, but I don't.

5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product. I had the original kindle with keyboard but thought I would try the new paper white. I started with the voyager because it had the side button option for page turning. I sent it back the first day. Not worth the extra money for the button page turners. Plus they felt awkward. I am not sure why the page turning buttons were discontinued in the first place but oh well. I then tried the newest paper white. It was nice but I noticed little ink smudges on the bottom of the screen. Not overwhelming but enough to annoy me. I thought it may be defective so I returned it and ordered another. Same thing. I returned it.I then ordered this product. It's beautiful. The touch screen page turn isn't as bad as I assumed. Plus the touch a word and the dictionary comes up. It's sweet. The main reason I wanted a new kindle is that the original one I had you couldn't adjust font size or type. It was getting harder for me to read. This new one you can. I can see great without adjusting font size due to a darker option of font print. Very happy with this product so far. Would def recommend. The price is great also compared to the new models. If they would fix the ink smudge problem I would go for the paper white model. But not until then.,Great product.;;;;;;

There very well might be a way to do that and I just haven't figured it out yet. It's pretty light weight, and with the case (purchased separately), it's easy to take wherever I want. I love touching the screen to turn pages. Love the easy interface. The one thing that I wish it did is to recognize if I'm viewing it landscape or portrait without me having to change it in the settings.

"4.0 out of 5 stars,""Overall, I like the Kindle a lot. There are a couple of things that bug me, though, that keep me from giving it 5 stars.First of all, it's slippery - I'm not sure if they did that on our purpose so you would have to buy a cover, but it can slip out of your hands pretty easily.Secondly,  the touch screen can be kind of a pain in the backside. If you move the Kindle (like stand up and walk around with it) and you haven't turned it off, you're likely to move through pages unwittingly. Even just reading, if you adjust your hand, or your fingers slip, you turn pages. More of an inconvenience than a flaw, but I REALLY liked the buttons on the side for page turning."",""A couple of irritating things, but overall, good""";;;;;;
"4.0 out of 5 stars,""I'm not a reader at all. I've always wanted to, but I've never set as one of my priorities. I always loved technology, so I thought that it would be perfect to start reading on an e-book. And it works! At least until now (I'll update you all later).I'm not giving 5 stars though because it doesn't come with a wall charger. I know that everybody should already have one at home, but the one recommended from Amazon costs 20$! I would rather pay extra money to come with one than open the kindle box and didn't find one! I felt the same when I bought an expensive glasses that didn't come with case! I think that this is ridiculous because it doesn't cost a lot to them to produce it, and they still want to make more money from us. I know that this is how business works nowadays, but if you want full satisfaction from your customer, you should know that this is necessary. Include it on the price.

I set it up for a 12-year-old with the Kindle FreeTime.  It's kind of a pain. I thought I would be getting emails alerting me to how much she's read and how much progress he's making but I don't. The overall shape of it… I think I prefer the original Kindle. This one is thicker and the edges don't slope to near nothing like the original did.  I think I have normal size hands, but it feels too small to comfortably hold and be able to see the whole screen.  I liked on the original one that you could touch the button on either side of the screen to turn forward or back depending on which hand you were holding it with. This one forces you to use you're right hand to turn the page if you're holding it with your left hand.I wish I hadn't gotten the special offers thing to save money. Because now my 12-year-old is seeing advertisements for things not meant for a 12-year-old. They're not inappropriate, they just aren't kid friendly.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""Amazon now has Kindles at three price points, and this basic model without the self-illuminated display is the perfect beginning point for someone new to e-readers and who might be uncertain about how much they will use the device compared to traditional books.The display is suitable for normal lighting conditions but not dim light, so if intending to use it for reading in bed and without a light by the side of the bed for illumination, for example, either the Paperwhite or Voyage might be a better choice.The strengths of this model, in addition to the low price, are the terrific battery life and the great amount of storage available. Since there is no demand on the battery to power lighting of the display, the normal time span between needed charges is the greatest of any of the Kindle e-readers. The storage is the same as all of the three models, 4 GB which is a tremendous amount of space, sufficient for thousands of books.At $79 this can almost be an impulse purchase for many people, and if the user later finds that an illuminated display is desired, it can be a nice hand-me-down to someone, or kept as a backup device.I have both the Paperwhite (first generation) and Voyage models myself. Noticing that many of the most recent reviews for this entry model are facile and useless, I thought that a more informed point of view was needed. This is an excellent product, and Amazon backs it up with superior customer service.

I really appreciated that it has a wonderful touch screen and no buttons. I did not consider the voyage because of its price and other features such as the buttons and light which I don't care about.

Compared the Kindle Keyboard, it's so easy to download books from your archive, move books between collections, and remove books from collections and from the device - all thanks to the touchscreen.  It's fast and way more responsive than my KK, what used to take a minute is now instant!  And because my books stay categories even if they're not on the device, I don't need to keep all 2000-odd books on the device :)The only downsides - I can't always figure out the exact view I want  (cloud/on device, collections/books/all, and recent/title/author/collections all combine in different ways),but that's minor.  The biggest drawback for me is that now I have to actually move my thumb to turn pages, whereas on the KK I just needed to squeeze.  I'm still too aware of the movement required, although I'm sure I'll get used to it and it'll fade into the background.  Besides, all the good points far outweigh these two minor concerns.Oh, another caveat - KK collections are not importable to the new kindle.  Some of my very old and since deleted collections showed up, but none of my current ones.  I'm having to manually go through my books and add them to collections.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I own a 2nd edition Kindle--I waited to see how the 1st ed, went before I purchased it.  I paid quite a bit of money for it, even got the leather case for it, a kandle light, and even subscribed to a newspaper!  It came out around $300 dollars at that time but also had the free 3g for life-which was super nice.  I say was because well, the kindle was in my backpack and met its end with being slammed into a corner of a desk that shattered the screen.  It sucked.  So when Amazon offered the latest kindle for only $60 bucks, I jumped on it.Now it ain't a Voyager, like I got my mom for Christmas, but its damn near close.  It's WAY better than my 2nd ed. ever was, except for the advertisements.  Being a Prime member just sweetens this deal.  Except for the advertisements.  I have to keep saying that because that is the ONLY thing wrong with this model.  The non-advertisement model would be better, but man, 60 bucks for a kindle....that's like a no-brainer.  I'll deal with these ads because they aren't obtrusive, I just would rather see the old screensavers than an ad, but whatever.  A nintendo game is 60 bucks.

"3.0 out of 5 stars,""It's ok.  I actually prefer the oldest model better.  This touch screen freezes up in cold weather.  The older model did not.  It seems buggy, for example, sometimes when trying to go to the next page it readjusts the font.  That's very annoying.  It should be a 2 step process to change the font, yet when clicking in an entirely different area, it changes the font with one touch and will get stuck like that. I have to turn it off to change the font and then click to go to the next page.

I have hundreds of books and I give them a name that includes what order they are in the series, unfortunately I can't even see that on the main screen in the Kindle Touch, I have to open the book to figure out whether it is the next one for me to read. When a series has 7 books in it, that can be very frustrating. I also want a better way to organize my books into Collections, I previously used calibre, but to use it with this Kindle I would have to Jailbreak it, which I don't want to do.

5.0 out of 5 stars,I was debating on getting the basic kindle or the paperwhite kindle. So i went into best buy and saw the little difference between the two The paperwhite has a backlight for night time reading and a slightly higher resolution but thats all. If you want to spend 40 more bucks for a light that you can simply turn on a lamp or get a clip on light for less than five bucks and the reolution isnt a big deal if you are reading books because most of the time its not like your going to zoom all the in. So if you just willing to do 40 more bucks just for a backlight then be my guest but the basic kindle is a bang for the buck it even has the anti glare screen which is amazing but it all depends on the person if they like the fancier version thats seems to me like a waste ot 40 bucks that you can buy a couple books with.,Basic kindle vs kindle paperwhite;;;;;;

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""This is my 3rd Kindle. As with any new electronic gadget there is a bit of learning to be done. I now love my new Kindle as much as I have loved my Kindles before.  The reason I'm on my 3rd Kindle is that they break for no apparent reason.  One day they just don't work any more.  My last one just couldn't be woken up, it must have been in a deep coma.  Troubleshooting with one of the Amazon technicians did not bring it back to life. I had that one for about 1 and 1/2 years.  It was a replacement for my previous Kindle that also had succumbed to sudden death after about 2 years.  That one was still under the extended warranty I had purchased.  So my 2nd Kindle was free. When it broke the warranty had expired. I had to pay for my new Kindle, and I also purchased an additional 2yr warranty.  In fact I was so discouraged with the Kindles that I first bought a Kobo,. To my dismay I found out that  Kobo and Kindle do not speak a common language. The Kindle app could not be downloaded onto the Kobo.  All my books, some of which I had not yet read, were for Kindle.  So what could I do?  Since my e-reader is my favorite thing I bought another.  How sad that Amazon is unwilling or unable to create a Kindle with a respectable life span.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""OMG this is literally my favorite object in the world. I love it. I cherish it. I have barely put it down since I opened it a few days ago. As a commuter into NYC this is going to be my best investment ever (especially since I got it through the Lightning Deal on Prime Day). I had a charger butt already, so I didn't need to splurge on the additional butt, but I think it's annoying that it comes separately. I guess Amazon has to make up for their unsurpassable customer service some how.Anyway, I didn't buy a screen protector (I forgot about it), and I'm glad I didn't. First of all, I tend not to touch my electronics (computer, phone, tablet, etc) with sticky/greasy/disgusting fingers so I wasn't concerned about that, but I knew fingerprints could be an issue, and later on pretty distracting for reading. This screen is pretty matte to begin with, and with a gently touch I haven't noticed any prints or weird smudges on the screen.Also, the no button thing some people were complaining about I find as a non-issue.

"4.0 out of 5 stars,""I should probably start my review by stating that I've never purchased or used a Kindle before so I cannot compare it to other models.  The immediate issue I found with it has to do, I suppose, with my reading habits and not the device itself.  I like to read in the evenings after the day has wound down and, by extension, it is usually dark.  Without a backlight or some other pop-out LED, I can't read it.  Well, books don't come with lights either so this is hardly the fault of the Kindle.  So I searched for a case with a popout LED.  Suprisingly, this is harder than it sounds.  After much searching, I finally found one for $59.99, exactly what I paid for the Kindle itself.  So now it costs a little less thrifty $129.99.  Well, surely the books, given that there is no printing or shipping involved, must be fundamentally cheaper.  Nah, not so much.  Some Amazon sellers have paperbacks for less than the electronic version of the books I want to buy.  Hmmmm.Well, I'll say this for it.  I can pack hundreds of books in one little device and its easy to use and read.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""Great product thus far. my first kindle. I enjoy not having to hold the pages open, and also be able to access new books via amazon account on my computer when I feel inspired to and not having to wait or trek to a library. The display is comfortable to read from and easy to navigate, although sometimes it can bit a bit challenging in comparison to a full on tablet display - although i would take this any day of the week over a tablet for reading, regardless of what i just mentioned. I enjoy being able to touch anywhere near the edge of the """"page"""" to turn to the next page.I have not tried other Kindle products but do enjoy the newspaper style color scheme, it is easy on the eyes. I'm not sure how I would feel about a stark white back ground, if that is what the Paperwhite model offers.BEST feature: A dictionary at a moments notice, by simply highlighting a word you will get an in-page dictionary definition/diplay with an option for Wikipedia info. it feels as if i can have a custom footnote at anytime for any word, great for many uses. Also it then keeps track of the words you looked up in a vocab-builder, which is nice to review later.the fact that the screen is not centered in the item/case (having a thicker dimension below the screen) is actually beneficial, as it allows the kindle/book pages to not be hidden behind the folds of a blanket for example, so I am actually and very happy then it is not symmetrical top to bottom.Negative: mainly because I really dislike the means and methods of the advertising industry in general - The Kindle never """"turns off"""" even if you turn the screen off.. by morning time, there will be a display showing some book or amazon product for sale. This feels imposing to my personal space, as I often may leave the kindle next to my bed.. then to wake up and have an advertisement in my room just doesn't feel appropriate. Of course this is minor and doesn't ruin the product by any means, and can easily be fixed by simply turning the device over for example. But, I wish I didn't have to see the advertisement each and every time as I open/unlock my book/kindle just as I am getting relaxed/clearing my mind from all the materialism and other issues of the world and am looking forward to reading. Maybe its an odd thing to mention but I thought it would be worth sharing."",Good product. I have not tried other Kindles but am very happy with the function and display.";;;;;;

I absolutely hate the touch screen. It is way too sensitive so I end up jumping between pages randomly, or highlighting/pulling up the dictionary for random things if I hold it down for even a split second too long. I also hate that I can't bring it to the pool or the beach because I try to put it in a plastic bag to protect it from the water and the plastic bag just constantly pushes against the screen and hits random features such as changing the text size and font, highlighting passages, and pulling up the dictionary.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I hesitated for a long time to buy a Kindle as I love real books. So when I finally took the plunge I was pleasantly surprised. I love that my Kindle is lightweight, easy to carry and stores many books in a tiny space. Its non-glare screen makes outdoor viewing very easy, and on windy days I can read hands free whilst eating lunch, without having to worry about pages being turned. It never loses my place, i can bookmark passages easily and highlight text if needed. If I'm reading the book on more than one device, it will sync to the furtherest page read. The device holds a charge for weeks. The only drawback is the inability to read the screen in a darkened room. For that I have a tablet and use the Kindle app for android, but I cannot read the tablet in broad daylight."",Love It!";;;;;;
"3.0 out of 5 stars,""Some of these """"did you read the description??"""" reviews are a bit harsh, considering that many people drawn to a low-cost e-reader may have never purchased one before, and don't really know what to look for.  Such was the case with my husband who got this for me for Christmas. I wanted an e-reader so I could read a book without being interrupted by texts and other notifications popping up on my screen (without having to mess with my phone's settings every time I stopped and started reading) and so I could read in bed without turning on a lamp or draining my phone battery.  Having zero experience with designated e-readers, my husband thought they'd all be like my daughter's iPad, or our phones: lit.  This is not. You can read from this Kindle under the same conditions you can read from an actual book.  No reading without the bedside lamp. So that in itself was a deal-breaker for me, but some other impressions I had: this thing is so lightweight, I love that about it! Also, the dictionary and character bio features are awesome. I can't tell you how many times I'll be reading a book, and someone who disappeared in Chapter 2 comes back in Chapter 12, and I have to go flipping back to Chapter 2 to remind myself who he is.  For the negative though, coming from the Kindle and Nook apps for iPhone, I love their animated page turns.  You don't get that with a """"real"""" Kindle.  For video editors out there, the effect is comparable to a one-second cross-disolve. It's something I'd get used to, but it felt strange at first.  But I never did get the hang of paging through my library. Sometimes it would lag, sometimes it would flip perfectly, other times I had to try to flip three or four times. Strange.  This device also has no kind of contrast control.  Not-quite-pure-black type on a gray page is a little tough to read, but you get what you get.  I do a lot of graphics work, and the slightly bitmapped appearance of some of the larger images/icons on the page bothered me a lot, but I'm betting most people wouldn't notice or care.So, if you know what you're looking for and understand what you're getting here -- a simple e-reader without any kind of backlight/front-light, whatever, my guess is that you'll be perfectly happy, because that's what this is.  But if you've been using a Kindle or Nook app on a tablet or phone, know that this is different. It seems like the Kindle Paperwhite is more of what I'm looking for, so I'll try to convince the hubby to upgrade. :-)"",It's is what it is -- which is nothing like the Kindle app for your phone.";;;;;;

"2.0 out of 5 stars,""I have one of the 'original' Kindles and have loved it from day 1.  I have purchased various Kindles for other family members and everyone agrees that they are the best! I decided to purchase a newer Kindle for my husband and myself  because the battery on our old models must be plugged in almost every night.  I was attracted to this new model because of the longer battery life and the smaller size. Unfortunately, we all have certain games we love to play on our reading devices in addition to reading great books.  I was not aware that this could not be done on this Kindle. If I had known, I would have never purchased these devices.  I use my new one for reading only (its great for that) and then switch back to my older Kindle to play the brain games. My husband, who is an avid card player refuses to use his new one and is still only using the old one.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I’ve owned an iPad for several years. Actually, I’ve owned two iPads (1st iPad & iPad2). I’ve loved and hated the iPads. I love the battery life and semi portability of them. Besides my 6 year old playing games on it, I spent 97.4375% of the time reading on the Kindle app. Yet, outside in sunlight iPads are USELESS!! Forget taking an iPad outside and relaxing on a porch or park.So for my birthday, my wife bought me an $99 plain jane Kindle. It is incredible!!  The electronic ink technology is amazing after using glaring screen of an iPad and other tablets. Cuts down on blue light usage at night which allows me more easily fall asleep.  I already had  a decent collection of books.  Because I’m a Amazon Prime member it allows me to borrow books from Kindle Owner’s Lending Library which should pay for the actually Kindle within a year.  It’s light and easy to carry my Bibles on the Kindle to church. iPad was always a little inconvenient. Kindle with an Omoton smart case can easily slip in my pants pocket.  Sermons/song lyrics can be stored on Kindle for easy access for spur-of-the-moment moments. :)  It’s easier to lay down on a podium and see from any angle without an obvious “glow”. Others around you are less likely to be distracted by an “electronic device” being used.Bookmarks, notes, search features allows me to easily replace iPad for speech giving and church usage. Not even considering the huge price difference between an iPad and basic Kindle I would consider readers and laptop owners to try a Kindle e-reader. I recommend for preachers, musicians, and book lovers alike.I learn more with the Kindle's built in dictionary, Wikipedia, X-ray, and search features.

Also I get the dictionary  sometimes when I mean to turn the page.  I do like the dictionary feature, however.

Navigating is not clear yet but looks like it will be way easier than with the older Kindle. I've been using my laptop to read Kindle books but it was way to big and uncomfortable.I am learning Spanish. I loved that I could look up Spanish words as I read. I did not have that capability on the laptop. That will be a big plus. It looks like there was a Spanish to English dictionary provided with the kindle also as well as several other languages.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I like this Kindle but I am thinking of upgrading to the backlight version and passing this one onto my son.  A little backstory, I like to read and I bought a phablet last year so I could use my cell to read during lunch.  My current job does not allow cellphones (or any camera/video device) of any type in the office so I purchased a Kindle.  While I like the concept of the Kindle I find that I miss the color screen of my phablet.  Also, I realized that I tend to read a lot a night and not having a backlight requires me to switch between my phone and the Kindle.In essence the Kindle does what I needed it to do but I think the backlight/color screen would be better for my use."",Nice Kindle..Just not sure it is for me.";;;;;;
"4.0 out of 5 stars,""It's pretty much everything I wanted in an e-reader. My only complaint is that a slightly sharper screen would be nice. If you look really closely, you can see some jagged edges to text.  But once you're holding it at a normal reading distance, everything looks fine. The battery life is insane. I went almost a month, having read two and a half books, before it needed recharging. The amount of storage is overkill.  I definitely do not need that much space, as I typically read just one book at a time. But if you want to carry a library around with you you can. A definite must accessory for this is a case that can serve as a stand, and most importantly hold it up vertically, not horizontally! Borrowing books from my library is pretty easy";" I just hate the short check-out period. Transferring books from my PC to the Kindle took a little figuring out, but in the end it was a cinch using the free program, Calibre. Oh, two other features I love is the quick ability to look up words, and then how that word is added to a list of words I'd previously looked up that I can then study via flash cards to learn. Very cool! I do not regret not buying the version without the backlight. I always read next to a lamp, and it looks great in natural daylight too."",Love it. No going back to clunky books.";;;;;

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""Having never had a Kindle, I have to say, I am impressed. I had toyed around with some of the older versions (with buttons!) but I have to say that this version is how it was meant to be. It's like something out of the future, ads and all! It's even more minimalistic than your given iDevice, as there is only one physical button, an that's on the bottom edge of the device. The face is just screen and handling area, and I think that's just what it should be.Reading is wonderful on it. The letters are amazingly sharp. It reads like a book - well, in my opinion, better, since you don't have to deal with a device that you need to hold open to read.Before purchasing, I agonized for a while over the """"special offers"""". I'm a heavy user of adblockers, and I can't stand most advertising. Honestly, the ads on the device don't bother me. I was quite surprised. There's a small banner at the bottom, but that only shows when in the menus, not when actually reading (which would be abhorrent!). The lock screen is a full screen ad, but the alternative is just a simple lock screen image, so whatever. It doesn't get in the way of anything physically or mentally.I got a refurbished model, but the device was just like new. Maybe it didn't have some extra packaging goodies, but I'm not missing out here. I'm already enjoying reading some Arthur C. Clarke on the device and it works great."",I now prefer this to books";;;;;;

"4.0 out of 5 stars,""My sister gifted me a Kindle about a year ago and it has changed my life quite drastically. I'm the kind of person who enjoys watching TV and movie adaptations of stories rather than reading books. But, after getting a Kindle, I've been reading about 5 novels every single month and the experience is just amazing. Recently I read """"the fault in our stars"""" and watched the movie too and I could easily relate to why people keep bashing on adaptations. Anyway, coming back to the device. I really love how portable and lightweight it is. Unlike my smartphone, its battery lasts literally forever and I have to hardly ever charge it.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I have had a kindle fire for a while and have been pleased with it as a tablet but I really wanted a reader specifically. They just have a better display for reading, especially outside where the glare of the tablet makes it very difficult to read. Then the debate was regular Kindle vs Kindle Paperwhite. I read a ton of reviews on both and watched video reviews and asked people I knew who had them. From what I gathered, the primary difference is that the Paperwhite has an internal light and the regular Kindle doesn't. Oh and the Paperwhite is $40 more. Amazon has an excellent return policy which I've used before and been happy with, so I decide to save the $40 and go with the regular Kindle, knowing that if the lack of a light really bugged me I could return it and get the paperwhite. Well I've had it two weeks now and I can understand how the light would be useful, but I am 100% pleased with my kindle. It reads perfectly, there are zero issues with the display (I've read reviews with the paperwhite having spots in some cases or uneven light), and it doesn't bother me in the slightest to read under a lamp. I give the Kindle 5 stars because it is exactly as marketed. What you see is what you get, no less, no more. It reads sooooooo much better than my Fire, and it's lightweight and super easy to use.If you're on the fence between a Paperwhite and the regular Kindle, my advice is this: if you regularly read in dim lighting (not just dark but dim) and don't have access to light to read by, think about the paperwhite. Otherwise, save the $40 and get the regular! It's awesome!"",""For me, regular Kindle was the way to go""";;;;;;

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""This is one of the best purchases I've ever made! I'm an avid reader, and I LOVE the feel of holding a hard copy book in my hand and turning the pages as I read. I am also in the habit of highlighting passages and making margin notes as I read nonfiction, which was a big reason for me not having been open to the idea of an electronic book. When I read the description of the Kindle 6"""" Glare-Free Touchscreen and saw that it has the highlight and note feature, I became more receptive to the idea of an electronic book. I chose the glare-free style after some debate because I thought about how difficult it is trying to read the screen of my Smart phone outside. I told myself I would just use the bedside lamp for night reading. Over the last couple of years, I have gotten into the habit of Googling topics on my phone in the dark before going to sleep. Usually, not always, I wake up the next morning with a terrible headache. The first night I read from my new 6"""" Glare-Free Kindle, with the bedside lamp for light, I kept thinking to myself, """"This thing is so comfortable to hold....even lying down"""". I really liked the fact that I could enlarge the font and not have to keep readjusting my glasses while lying on my side because I re-sized the font enough that I did not have to wear my glasses :-) ! The next morning when I woke up, after having read for hours on the Glare-Free Kindle, my head did not hurt at all! Now when I read outside, I don't have to find a shady spot nor do I have to hold the Kindle in weird positions trying to see what is on the screen like I have to do when I try to read my phone screen outside. Another GREAT thing I LOVE about having many books on the Kindle is that instead of dragging along a heavy tote bag full of books on trips, I will be able to stick my Kindle and my charger in my purse and will still be able to have a choice of what I'm in the mood to read.

I bought a book from gumroad and they only provide pdf at the moment for that book, fine, I use calibre to generate a kindle friendly format, sent it to my kindle account and started reading it there and boom! kindle will just restart itself. Fine, I'm using calibre, my bad, I then sent my pdf and started reading it and bam! again restarting. And not only that it would say kindle out of memory and restart.2. I bought a kindle book directly from amazon, reads fine and everything, and today it occurred to me that I wanted to do a search on the book, type, type, type, hit search, bang! again! restarting without saying anything.I'm really disappointed since both matters are something that my oldie kindle was able to handle, and now I spent bucks in something newer that's really dissatisfying.

"1.0 out of 5 stars,""Amazon Kindle customer support is as poor as the device. We have had to buy 3 of these!!  First one crapped out and Amazon did what they should and replaced it. Second one failed (partial frozen screen) at 11 months.  When I enquired, it got interesting because A-Kindle support told me they couldn't help because I didn't have possession of the device. (It was with my child, overseas)  I got it about a week and a half later and then they told me they wouldn't honor a replacement because in the intervening 10 days the device crossed the one year return window.  Too bad for me.  Then they changed their mind on that explanation and said the 12 month warranty period does not apply to products given because the first product was defective - only to the first broken productThe Amazon Kindle algebra is apparently this simple: 1 defective product + 1 replacement defective product = only 12 month original warranty. The new math!They first offered me like $20 toward buying a new kindle. ha!  I already had to buy a refurb'ed one to send overseas to swap with my kid so they would have one and I could get the broken one back. So when I express my dismay about the support process, they ask me to contact them again and I go thru the whole episode and they bump up the coupon offer to $30. I still don't need a fourth and lost 30 minutes I'll never get back. Then they has the gall to send me a customer service email that says, """"I understand that how inconvenient it must have been to borrow a free book and sign up each time.""""

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I used to be an ereader skeptic until I purchased this kindle as a Christmas gift for myself because I don't have enough room to collect books like I normally have right at this point in time. I wasn't expecting much just wanted to be able to read the books I would normally buy in paperback in a much more compact way. I've fallen in love with this kindle though (it takes priority over my cell phone even) and I plan to be a kindle user for life probably because this is the best electronic device I've ever bought.I have a brain condition that causes migraines on a semi-constant basis so reading off a kindle fire (or some other tablet with a backlight) was out of the question. You need to buy a light to read with this kindle in the dark because it reads exactly like the pages of a book. It's amazing! That's my favorite feature about the whole thing. I also like that it has touch page turns. Buttons would probably make it too bulky. It's so sleek the way it is.I have always had a dictionary handy in case I ever needed to look up a word. With the kindle, it has a built in dictionary inside of it! You highlight (by holding down) the word and above it pops in a window with the definition. It's amazing honestly. It also pulls up the wikipedia page for whatever word you highlighted. Even if you're reading a book you manually put on there because it wasn't available in the kindle store.Another amazing feature is the xray. You highlight a character's name and it gives you a complete biography of them. If you like those fantasy/sci-fi books that come with maps at the beginnings and have tons of hard to pronounce character names, you can keep them all straight because of the xray feature (however this one only works if you get the book from the kindle store).One thing I don't like is that it's so sensitive that if something brushes up against the top (i.e. a cat) the font will change sizes randomly and you always have to set it back to your preferred font.I don't know why people make such a fuss about special features. I wouldn't pay extra not to have them because I hardly notice them at all. I thought the kindle would be too small initially, but it's really a perfect size. It's bigger than a dollar store paperback. I love how it shows you what percentage you are through of the book.Finally, if you're poor but love books like me and you hoard used paperbacks DON'T be fooled into thinking you're spending less money on books this way because they're digital. They're cheaper than a new hardback or even a new paperback but they're not cheaper than a used paperback. Like I said, I also did not have the room to keep hoarding them the way I was which also led me to purchase this kindle. However, I also think that it is worth paying a couple dollars extra on the digital kindle copy of the book versus the used paperback just for the kindle's neat features.All in all 5 stars this was my favorite gift of Christmas by far. I will use this for a very, very long time."",A Lifelong Christmas Present";;;;;;

I don't recommend buying the charging block. If you have a smart phone then you already have a block that allows a USB charger to go into an outlet. The battery life is really long so you can charge it for a couple hours then use it for a month straight without charging again.

The customer service person told me there was no difference in the one I had and the touch screen one.

"3.0 out of 5 stars,""OK, it's a Kindle so it's a great thing. However, it does not compare favorably to the older model. It is awkward to hold, which gets pretty significant when one is reading a book for more than a few minutes. The touch screen is either too sensitive or not responsive enough, depending on what you're trying to do. If you want to enter your code, it is unresponsive and takes a looong time to register each touch. If you're trying to move your fingers to a comfortable position, the screen registers the corner of your knuckle as a touch and starts to change the font or go to the home page, or something else that interferes with the actual reading.

"4.0 out of 5 stars,""I am pleased with the kindle.  Books are easy to read, easy to load.  I successfully borrowed a library book.  There is an excellent selection of books both free and for purchase.  The ads are not intrusive.  Battery life is excellent, it charges quickly.Downside is that the touch screen occasionally advances more than one screen at a time, and getting back to the starting point is sometimes a problem.  I would prefer that the charge level be visible within a book, so low charge state, if it occurs would not be a surprise.I think this device is valuable as a single-purpose device, a book reader, and well worth the cost."",An excellent single-purpose digital book reader";;;;;;
"3.0 out of 5 stars,""I had the lowest level Nook from three years ago and thought I'd upgrade with the glare-free touchscreen Kindle. I wish I had gone back to a Nook. I bought the Kindle for the screen - and it is better although not a dramatic change from the older Nook. The Kindle is also faster when opening a book, but page turning seems about the same..The best thing is the battery. On the down side, you cannot expand the memory with an SD card on the Kindle, which I find very frustrating. I would love to use margin notes except the touchscreen is ridiculously sensitive and it either turns the page or only highlights a single word when I want the paragraph - adding the note is not exactly great either. The same sensitivity interferes when trying to look up a word - if you don't get it just exactly right, you simply turn the page. Sigh."",""Nice on speed and looks, but the touchscreen is not great.""";;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I love the kindle. I have Prime so I am able to borrow books for free through the lending library which is a great benefit.After I purchased this we went on vacation and I was able to read without any glare on the beaches of Jamaica. The one thing I like is the new smart lookup. You can lookup dictionary definitions or even wikipedia entries all without leaving your page.Battery life is excellent. If you read for 1 hour a day the battery will last 2 weeks, with wifi signal turned off. If wifi signal is on it kwill constantly seach for the connection and that will drain your battery.I am not sure how many books this holds but it has to be alot. I have over 100 because I never delete.Charging time is a little slow. When I charge mine it takes about 3.5 hours to fully charge. Other than the charging time, this Kindle is great. If you purchase the one with special offers you will see ads everytime you turn it on, no big deal. No ads while reading.."",The kindle is very impressive";;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I've long since graduated to a Paperwhite and really wouldn't buy this anymore (I'm spoiled now with the built in light.  No more clumsy clip- ons!)

My reading is done almost exclusively on the Kindle now, and I LOVE paper books.

I can read it at home or take it with me to the occasional doctor's appointment - a blessing since the magazine offerings there are of no interest to me.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,I have been hesitant to acquire a kindle of my own for some time as I thought the electronic pad would be inferior to holding a paper book in my hands.  I received this for Christmas however and I have to say that I have been very impressed with the Kindle.  I recently took it on a trip with me to Arizona and it was able to be used for several hours each day on a single charge (prior to trip) allowing me to read several books during the trip.  While I still lament not being able to hand somebody a book I just read and urging them to read it (not many of my friends have Kindles but there is apparently a kindle share thing you could otherwise do) this promises to get a great deal of use from me in the months to come,""Had low initial expectations, was impressed with how well it works""";;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I have wanted a Kindle since they first came out years ago. I was finally able to get one for myself this Christmas. Its my own personal tradition to get myself things as I shop for others so I don't get jealous. Anyway, this is one of the best gifts I have ever given myself. It is quick and easy to use and navigate. The battery I have only charged once in the month I have had it. I already have a nice little library of books to choose from. I hope to have this for years to come and I will definitely get another one when this one retires.Edit: Just a little side note, I don't make much but there are a lot of free books that are great on Amazon. There is also Kindle Unlimited which is like an Amazon library card and you can check out 10 books at a time for ten bucks a month. I also joined a site called Bookbub.com and they send daily emails with a list of books that are between 2.99 and Free! Ive added so many books to my Kindle library with that site. Its also not just for Amazon, there are books that are on Google and much more. So I can still read lots of books and not spend a ton of money."",I love my Kindle!!";;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""The Kindle lives up to its promises. It was easy to setup, downloads books quickly, and is an enjoyable way to read. It's light to hold and turns pages quickly. Of course, without any light, you must use it in lit rooms or outdoors. This means the battery lasts a long time. I also have a smartphone and an iPad, so I can use one of them if I need a backlight. The Kindle software puts up a dialog box when you pick up your book, asking you if you want to jump to the most advanced position, no matter which platform you were last reading it on. Some (not all) books even have the option to read out loud, an audiobook. And they still keep track of your last stop point when you go back to the non-audio version of the book. I have always liked the Kindle reader software, now it's even better to have a Kindle, too. Especially, when I take it outdoors to read."",Kindle lives up to its promises.";;;;;;

It will fit perfectly in my purse. I can't wait to see how convienent it is to carry a book (more like tons of books) with me everywhere.

"3.0 out of 5 stars,""I mean it served my purpose and I have read like 5 books on it since I got it back in the winter of 2014. I don't have nothing to complain about its physical design and materials Amazon used to make it. Yes, this one is thicker than Paperwhite and feels very plastic, but I'm completely fine though, what you expect from a $80 dollar device? An iPhone costs you $700 dollars. But I have to say, the screen is decent.The touch screen has its pros and cons. You can click a word or a name to check dictionary or X-ray, which is very nice. If it's buttons, it will be a huge pain.But the touch screen is very sensitive. It changes my font and font size even if I didn't purposefully do it. When sometimes I open my Kindle, I was  a few pages ahead or behind where I left and was in a weird font and font size. That's why I have to set the password and I suppose Kindle is not smart enough to enter my password automatically and change my font size.Honestly, that's my only complaint. I bought this version because I need something simple and basic, without chunk of other non-reading related capabilities. I prefer to read a paperback, but if I read on a Ebook, I hope my Ebook will as close to a paperback as possible.I just hope Amazon won't ever forget our very intrinsic motive to buy a Kindle so there is still a Kindle in the market that I need to buy.

The screen as its being shown in the Kindle main page video is not all how my product screen is. In-fact its more duller than a book. We mostly have yellow light in our apartment and in the evening  i struggled to read it at an angle. If I leave it flat directly below the light its a lot better. When i saw the review I picked Kindle ahead of the Fire Tablets because they didn't had some features like word wise and vocabulary builder etc. I am afraid it seems either i picked up the wrong kindle or was expecting a bit too much out of this. Its very difficult to convince kids to use it with all those High resolution smart tablets out there.,Display not as bright/sharp as you would see in the demo video;;;;;;

I've used it everyday and then start forgeting about buying a real book again. You don't need to buy another wall adapter if you have adapter for your mobile phone that can put USB plug into it.  There are couple things that I don't like, first is about the battery. The battery life advertised as it last for several weeks, but if i use it everyday, it can last for only a week or less so i need to recharge it. The second thing is about its stability, my kindle got slower and hanged after using it for a couple weeks, at that time I cannot read the book at all.

"2.0 out of 5 stars,""Very disappointed with this new Kindle. I had the previous version (with buttons on the sides), unfortunately that one has been misplaced. I bought this new touch one while on sale since I love having the kindle for train rides, but it is not living up to expectations. The most annoying thing is that the touch seems to get caught on a glitch cycle where if I try to go back one page it takes me to a random forward page, and then I hit back and it takes me forward again and I get stuck in a loop of 2-3 pages flipping back and forth and it takes 6 touches just to get back to my original spot, and I give up on trying to go back a page because god only knows if I'll ever be able to get back to my current location. During this glitch cycle the bottom left corner always displays the same page number even when it is clearly a different page, so I literally have no idea where I'm at in the book or how to get back where I was...i get lost in the book and not in a good way.Also, this kindle seems to be slightly bulkier than the previous one--not by a lot, but the """"frame"""" is a few millimeters thicker, which isn't a big deal, other than the other one slid into back pockets/bags easier.I honestly don't know why they felt the need to update to a touch screen for the basic kindle--considering it is glitchy, bigger, and tapping a screen versus pressing a button doesn't change anything about my Kindle reading experience, but making me read my book like a flip book is really obnoxious."",Very disappointed with this new Kindle";;;;;;

I knew going in that it was touch screen, but I didn't realize how much of an impediment to reading that would be- my hands are often cold, so I wear gloves a lot- not good with the new Kindle. To me, it felt more like reading on a phone. Yes, the set up was easy and my old books appeared nicely- but I didn't find it nearly as appealing. Thankfully the folks at Amazon, upon hearing my unhappiness, allowed me to return it and I ordered a new """"old"""" Kindle so hopefully that one works out. FYI, for those who still have the plug/ charger that came with the older Kindles, this new kindle doesn't come with a power cord, but the charger/ plug for your old Kindle will work/ interconnect with this one, so you don't need to buy a new charger if you still have your old one. There isn't anything technically wrong with this Kindle- but for me, the size and the feel were unappealing. The lack of keyboard really wasn't a factor, but the lack of page turning buttons was a factor.

I realize one can buy covers, but then that adds cost and bulk, which tends to defeat the advantages of this Kindle by itself.  I'm enjoying reading more with this product than anything I could imagine since it's so different from reading book pages, yet so very advantageous.

Also, I tried to add my mom's account as the other adult and it wouldn't let me because I had had a different adult in the last 180 days which was a mix up I had when trying to set myself as the main owner."",Not user friendly and doesnt work with textbooks";;;;;;

"2.0 out of 5 stars,""This is my second Kindle.  The first had 3G and a keyboard.  The 3 G stopped working (and after 2 hours on the phone with a nice lady from India, they still couldn't find the problem and my phone died while she had me on hold and I couldn't stand the thought of calling back) and the battery wouldn't really stay charged anymore, had also gotten wifi so I got this new, cheaper version.  The touch screen is beyond a nightmare.  The regions actually overlap, so, for example, it's impossible to highlight anything without the pages flipping.  But that's just an example.  I have other touchscreen devices and this is beyond the worst.  Also the page turning forward region is on the right.  Who holds their book with their dominant hand?  No one.  So, if you're right-handed, you can't just slip your thumb over to tap it.  (I have left-handed friends who feel they're finally getting the recognition they deserve.)  Then, it's impossible to know what you have to do to turn a page, because in the store it's different from when you're reading, and within things in the store it may be different.  Turning the wifi on and off is also annoying, because you have to go into a menu to change it.  Actually, I hate this thing, but gave it an extra star just because, well, it's a Kindle, and you can shop and get good prices, etc.  Otherwise, it would be in the trash and I'd be investigating other e-readers."",What a misery this thing is.";;;;;;

The ability to change fonts, order books digitally at a low price, and check out books from her local library without leaving her house are just what she needed.

The only problem with my new one, being a touchscreen, it can be very sensitive and change more than 1 page at a time.  This does not happen often, and I can easily deal with it.  The only time it is a real problem is when I'm reading and I start to fall asleep, I can hit the screen in several places without realizing it, and when I jerk awake, I have to figure out where I need to go.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""My only """"issues"""" are I wish it had a light and/or that the screen was just the smallest bit brighter.

For someone like me who wants to read but doesn't have the room in their home for large shelves or really wants to see what reading on an eReader is all about I would recommend this as a """"starter"""" version.

"2.0 out of 5 stars,""This is a downgrade from the previous version.What you gain with the touchscreen is more than offset by the downgrade to a cheap plastic casing.

I have been using this Kindle for months and it still feels cheap to me.The only thing preventing me from switching to the Paperwhite, which my wife uses and which is made of noticeably better materials, is that the Paperwhite does not allow you to completely turn off the screen lighting while you are reading. If device lighting is not an issue for you, buy the Paperwhite.

It's very easy on the eyes, and despite a plastic housing, it feels well built.

"3.0 out of 5 stars,""The product itself is lovely and exactly what I wanted for my daughter.  HOWEVER I'm still REALLY annoyed.Only after I purchased this device did I find out that the FreeTime subscription (which ensures your child won't be able to accidentally purchase content) can't transfer public library materials already checked out to your device.  So if your child checks out digital materials from your local public library and wants to read them on your Kindle they can't do it safely in FreeTime.  They have to read it from the home screen where they can access EVERYTHING.  I suppose this is more a failing of the FreeTime software than the device but if that is the case, why is that a KindleFire will allow this functionality?  Why can't I have this function on my device??90% of the reason I bought this Kindle as part of the Kindle for Kids bundle is so that my daughter could easily access free library content.  I'm annoyed that in order to allow her to do that it appears I have to give her access to my Amazon account.

I have carried it in my handbag all over the southern states, it's so light it adds next to no weight to what I was carrying. I used it on the plane, in the car, by the pool. It went everywhere with me.  It is so light you can use it with one hand, you can adjust the font size, to suit your needs. It holds thousands of books which you can organise into categories/ authors, the page turn is quick and easy with a light tap. The battery lasts for many days / weeks on a single charge.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""Got this on a promo for $29 and we love it.  My wife said in hindsight that we should have gotten more than 1.  I wish it had the ability to read the book and had a light option, but with this being the bottom-end model, it is understandable that some of the features had to be cut to save cost.  Those items being missing weren't deal breakers for us, especially at the $29 price we paid.  If we were paying full price, however, I'd probably rather drop a few more dollars for the more feature-rich paperwhite models.I hope to one day see a full-color e-ink display in one of these.  LCD displays for book-reading gets the job done, but it isn't ideal for some of the same reasons Amazon teases the iPad for in their commercials.

4.0 out of 5 stars,I love Kindle - can't live without it.  So when my original Kindle that was given to me in 2008 finally wouldn't work I was frantic.  As soon as the new one arrived my old one mysteriously started functioning again.  So now I have them both working and can really compare the functions.  I still prefer the old one with the keyboard at the bottom.  It's easier for me to access the keyboard WHEN I WANT TO and not by accident as always happens with the new touchscreen Kindle.  I like the smaller overall size of the new one but not enough to give up the keyboard of the original.  I'm constantly touching the screen by accident and then have to figure out how to get rid of it.  I know I'll get used to it but it's annoying to have to do so.  The lighter weight of the newer one is nice considering that the weight of books is the reason I tried the Kindle to begin with.  I will eventually get used to the newer version.  Don't see much difference in the readability of them.,I love Kindle - can't live without it;;;;;;

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""A little strange to get used to at first after using my smartphone to read for a while but the kindle is really great in the long run! The display technology is really really easy on the eyes since there's no backlight and it's not LED and really feels like you're reading a real book. Also, I can literally download a hundred books whereas before I had to download, read, then delete a few at a time on my iPhone. The battery life is phenomenal and so far I've only charged it once! The past three months, I traveled around the country multiple times every week and it's the perfect companion for airplane trips both long and short! Size is great too for travel and fits into most every bag. Also, you can send pdfs of books to your @kindle email address (you get a unique one for each tablet when you buy one) and they get automatically added to your kindle cloud already converted to the right format and ready for download! All in all an amazing buy for those who love to read for pleasure and especially those who are trying to read more (like me). Even on short bus or car rides, I can whip this out and read for 10 minutes which is better than not reading at all in my busy schedule!"",""Great for all readers, especially those who are trying to read more and/or travel alot!""";;;;;;

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I give 5 stars to this reader, on the basis of what it is, in itself, standing on it's own, without comparison to a Paperwhite reader.  This is a great basic reader with 4GB of storage and a really crisp reading screen.  It's perfect outdoor, under sunlight, and looks very clear and easy to read with average indoor lighting.  Average, indoor, meaning not sitting next to a lamp.  No, it's not paper white in appearance but then I knew that buying it, so I'm not going to complain about that.  I previously had the Kindle Keyboard back in 2010 and the letters and words on the current basic Kindle looks far crisper and defined.  I like the touch interface on this also.  Far better than the Kindle Keyboard and very responsive.  Pages turn quickly and I love the page flip feature, where you can look ahead without losing your place.  Lack of that was very frustrating with my previous Kindle, and made it a real drawback in place of holding a physical book.  The extra features are numerous on this device, to much so to go into every one of them, but suffice to say that if you read and stay hooked into WiFi you can hook into Wikipedia for more information on what your reading and you can also share passages or highlights to your Facebook page.  All additions over my previous Kindle without losing any of the previous features I already liked about it.  I can say more, but why?

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""TECHNICAL REVIEW FOR THE KINDLE PAPERWHITE-  I refurbish old furniture for a living and my Kindle reads to me while I do so.  I've killed many a Kindle, 10 to be exact, and yet I still stand by the little guys.  Why?  Because I have concrete floors in my shop...enough said for the poor kindle I drop on it several times before it breaks.  I've never had one to break because of technical error only my user error- dropping it on the concrete floor.  So, now that you know every Kindle I order shakes in its packaging to be delivered to my shop, let's get down to business.  The only weakness I've been able to find with this kindle is the screen or what is under it to be precise.  It's glass and if you drop it just right- it shatters underneath the plastic top cover making your kindle unreadable but, still working. I've broken the screen and continued to have it read to me until a new one could be delivered.  That's the only weakness.  The case is made of plastic, hard and durable if you buy a cover for it.  I recommend that so you don't scratch the plastic screen if you decide to carry it with you in your purse or briefcase.  It is like a mini laptop in a sense- you have to protect the screen.  Next, the button version of this paperwhite is easy to push, a little small for your fingers but, doable after you learn the ropes of what to push and when.  The touch version is better and easier for a child or senior who has not so steady hands.  It is easy to learn how to work a Kindle.  My child, age 5 when I got my first Kindle, ended up showing me how to work it.  Everything is at the touch of a button or fingertip...there's no complicated programs or adding or removing things.  If you want to connect to Wi-Fi to buy a book, push a button and it takes you there.  That simple.  Your Amazon account is how you pay for a book and because you had to register your kindle, all you have to do is click the buy button and it downloads onto your kindle in less than 30 seconds.  I was in the grocery store last week and downloaded a new book, at a football game, at the doctors office...you get the idea- Anywhere.  This thing has the best Wi-Fi connection I've ever seen!!!!  I live in the sticks of Mississippi...When I say the Kindle can download anywhere, I mean anywhere.  In the middle of the wilderness on a four day camping trip down the Natchez Trace couldn't even stump my Kindle paperwhite's ability to download a book for me.  The app that allows you to listen while the Kindle reads to you-  It takes getting used to the robotic voice but, its a nice feature to have when your hands are full or busy doing other things.  Overall, I give this device five stars."",The kindle paperwhite is worth the money if you need a simple to use reader.";;;;;;

And it's supposed to be awesome when you're sitting outside in the sun and reading. But I hate sitting outside and I avoid the sun. I do most of my reading while sitting in semi-darkness.

"4.0 out of 5 stars,""My mother loves to read, though in recent years she'd fallen away from it (time, convenience, etc.), so naturally being a Kindle lover myself (I own a former generation with the keyboard), I thought this would be a great gift for her and was able to get a great deal on it during Black Friday this year.I dislike the idea of having ads on the Kindle (relevant or not), but appreciate Amazon's willingness to make the Kindle more affordable than previous models by having the option for ads (which you can pay $20 at anytime to remove, if you so choose). This Kindle is exceptionally more modern than my Kindle Keyboard and was significantly less expensive - that's a win no matter how you look at it.I found the size of it on Christmas morning a huge improvement over my Kindle. It is small and lightweight, yet the screen itself is much crisper and more responsive than my own. The only thing I can fault it with is that the black plastic looks and feels a little brittle and cheap.I helped my mom set it up which was easy enough to do and you're given a brief tutorial upon getting to the home screen for the first time. A lot of the basic concepts from my Kindle carried through to this Kindle (love the touch screen and the mini cover displays on your home screen """"book shelf). However, I really wish Amazon would give a start-up guide in paper form with the Kindle. The user guide on the device itself isn't ideal to learn from and I've had to field several questions from my mother since walking her through it on how to do something. I would argue that despite the better features (especially the ability to click a character's name in a book and be given a biography on them), it's a little less user friendly than previous versions. I'm 29 years old and the learning curve took me a bit, even being a seasoned Kindle user.Even in light of a few minor annoyances, I plan on buying one of these for myself soon. The size and speed of this model will be a great upgrade to my Kindle Keyboard and I absolutely love the ability to borrow Kindle books from my local library.I worry a bit that my mother won't fully utilize her Kindle based on the confusion she's had with the interface, but like everything else in life, practice makes perfect. I have some grievances with the user interface of this Kindle, but it's not enough to dissuade anyone from purchasing it and it remains the best e-reader on the market, and for good reason.My advice to potential buyers is to save $20 by buying the version with ads. They're relatively unobtrusive and many cases have functionality to auto turn on/off the device when the cover is opened, so it makes the ads even less noticeable. Use that $20 to invest in your first few books, and if you find the ads too much to deal with, you can go to Amazon and pay to have them removed.

4.0 out of 5 stars,Love this touch screen.  Had the old version with the button commands & will never go back.

However, this is the closest thing to reading a physical book. As we all know physical paper back or hardcover books have no backlighting just like this kindle.

"4.0 out of 5 stars,""I chose this version of the kindle over the paperwhite because of a great price offer at the time.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I am currently looking to replace my kindle, according to amazon it would be a 6th generation kindle, so that is what brought me to this page.  As I read the reviews I knew I needed to speak up in defense of this model.A short history to understand where I come from:  I bought my first kindle in 2009 and gave it to my daughter when she married later that year, it was a 2nd or 3rd generation model. I then bought the next generation model and used it for about 2-2.5 years until I had to replace it because the battery wouldn't hold a charge any more (at that time I used my kindle about 6 hours a day, sometimes up to 12 hours). I then bought the current one in the summer of 2013. This one saw less use because less than a month later my husband got me a kindle fire but still I would have to admit I have given it a work out and now it too no longer will hold a charge.For those who ask why I would use both kindles the answer is simple. As you can see from the above information I read a lot. I read on the way to work, on my break at work, at home sitting in my living room or den, and in my bed at night after my spouse is asleep. I initially took my kindle fire everywhere with me until I found that in bright light it was harder to read that my other kindle, while in dim light I like the display light of the fire. So when I travel to the beach I pack my kindle touch and drag it everywhere, and believe me when I say everywhere, and it has performed without a problem.So End of the story is that now I need to replace that kindle and I believe I'll get another touch.ADD: I've been able to get a hold of a relative's kindle voyage and I really liked it. Why you ask? Because the contrast in sunlight was just as good as my kindle touch but unlike the touch I can read it in the dark without waking up my husband.  The other plus is that unlike my fire the voyage didn't give me eye fatigue, meaning I read it one night without a problem for close to 8 hours where at 4 hours in the dark with the fire I begin to feel the strain. So what am I to do now?? Well right now I'll keep my touch and use the fire in the dark but when the touch goes get a voyage.Oh, and by the way, I get about 24-36 hours of reading time with the wireless off with one charge. This equals a charge about every 3rd day or on long weekend a partial charge every night. This is the same with my fire.  My 2nd gen kindle really did go for weeks, 2 or 3, between charges. My 3rd gen kindle made it about a week.  But my touch seems to lose more charge and I think it's because I sleep it and don't turn it off.  Maybe it would last a whole week if I turned it off every night, but who knows."",Long time Kindle user loves the kindle without a light";;;;;;
"4.0 out of 5 stars,Love it. So much less fuss than my old fire. Less distractions and less glare. I got a little book light so I can read at night since there is no built in light.

However, if you open up a paper book next to this kindle in a lower light situation (dimly lit living room at night), the paper book is easily readable, while the Kindle is very difficult to see without significant eye strain. With that said, as long as you have sufficient light, it's easily readable with no eye strain. I love the size and form factor, weight, and that I can easily switch between books on a whim. Would give five stars if it wasn't for the dark screen."",Love it but has a dark screen";;;;;;

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I got the Kindle for $50 on cyber Monday and figured if I didn't like it then I only wasted $50. Thankfully, I am really enjoying it. The thing I find most appealing about thisbebook is the convince. I can purchase a book online and it is immediately on my Kindle. I also find the recommendations in the Kindle store very helpful on choosing my next book. The kindle is lightweight and very portable. The glare-free works like a charm. I've read on the beach in the glaring sun and it worked great. I also like the cool features the Kindle has like the character list. I also like how you can click on any word and it will tell you the definition and store that word in your vocab builder. The battery lasts forever (days even a couple weeks). The only negative thing about this Kindle is there is no built in light so it's hard to read in the dark like any book. However, I bought this Kindle knowing that so I will not fault it for that. Overall, I love it because it has really made me more passionate about reading."",Convenience is key";;;;;;
"4.0 out of 5 stars,""The $59 kindle is a bargain.This is my first e-reader and I was undecided on which model to get, so wound up choosing the cheapest one.

The functions are very intuitive and i find myself leaving lots of highlights, notes and book marks to make referencing at a later date painless.The only down side of this product is that it is very basic, so if you are a gadget person, just anti-up and get the kindle fire, which is probably what i will do after i put some miles on the one i have.one really nice feature of the 6"""" Kindle is that it will fit in the inside breast pocket of a mens suit jacket, or pretty much any winter coat inner pocket which makes it easy to carry on the train for those of us that don't carry a man-bag around."",""Great Value, Fun to Read""";;;;;;

I can't change the star rating much - because my original complaint still holds true - there is not a case with integral light available for this Kindle because of it's design - and that is disappointing still.

She suggested this light (http://www.amazon.com/Belkin-Clip--Reading-Kindle-Graphite/dp/B004ZN5Q5W/ref=sr_1_8?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1433020341&sr=1-8&keywords=case+with+light)  and issued me a credit to try it out.

We'll see.I was really excited for this purchase.  I've had the original kindle forever and love it... but was always so frustrated by the constant accidental turning  of pages.  I love the size of this one too. Overall the Kindle itself I really like... but unlike the original, there is absolutely no """"lit"""" case available that doesn't counter the small portability of the device.  Remember the old kindle with built-in book light??!  Why oh why did you get rid of that option?  I am hesitant to purchase the newer backlit ones because that is the feature I like most about my kindle.  It really does still feel like reading a book.

Also while swiping is easy I did grow use to using the buttons on the side of my old kindle to turn the page as my fingers were already there so I barely had to move.Overall it is a great product and a worthy replacement, my prejudice and star reduction is mostly related to being more comfortable with some of the features of my older one.

"3.0 out of 5 stars,""I really like the basic Kindle - I use it in situations when I don't want to use my iPad.  I had to replace my last basic Kindle and wasn't really needing a touchscreen, but that is the only choice now.  I have found that the touchscreen can be problematic.  It frequently highlights text that I have no interest in highlighting - then I can't figure out how to undo the highlighting.  It seems really sensitive at times and less so at other times.  It often brings up definitions instead of turning the page - I don't need a definition for the word 'and'.  In addition, the screen is segmented into regions for moving forward, backward and settings, etc.  It is easy to move forward because over half the screen is used for moving forward, but I find that I need to tap on the actual left edge of the screen to go backwards, because it sometimes moves forward, even if My finger is a tiny bit to the right of the edge.

I have decided to keep the unit and accept the shortcoming of being able to scroll further through the book categories.  I can type in the topics and then make a selection.

"4.0 out of 5 stars,""As someone who loves to read in their free time, the Amazon Kindle has been an awesome product for me. This product is very durable and efficient, as I have already dropped it a couple of times and it does not have a scratch on it. It has been wonderful to have all of my reading materials (magazines, books, and newspapers) in one place. It will also be very helpful for family vacations, and for my parents to take on business trips. It has been very convenient to always have one item where my reading materials are stored. The battery life has also been outstanding, lasting almost weeks at a time. Compared to other products on the market, there is no glare on the screen when you are reading in the sun. This made a huge difference to me as I do most of my reading outside.Technology aspect-I am someone who does not need to have all the apps and games that some products offer with their reading devices, so if you are someone who is tech savvy, this product might not be for you. It is very straightforward and easy to use, which makes it perfect for me, as I have never been very good with technology.Kid Friendly- In my opinion, if you are looking for an e-reader, do some research before you purchase the product. I thought the Kindle was a good value for the price of $79.99, as there are many different Kindle products and competitor products that are much more expensive. This is especially if you are looking for an e-reader for a child, you may have hesitated before because of the price. With this model only being $79, you may have found your perfect product. One bonus is that the screen size is the same as the other Kindle devices, so you are not losing out on that if that is something that is important to you.One thing to keep in mind is that there is no buttons besides a power button.

I had wanted to start reading books electronically, but found that reading them on an iPad or my computer monitor was simply a disastrous notion, as my eyes would quickly become dry, itchy, and tired. I did a lot of research online and saw that the technology behind the Kindle screen was much different, but the idea of a screen that does not keep refreshing itself was odd to me. I thought it would just look like the slow-moving screen of my old Palm Pilot.To my surprise, this device is absolutely amazing. As long as the lighting is adequate, it is just like reading a book. The battery holds a charge for a long, long time, and the software (a detail which a nerd like me cares about) is actually quite full-featured. You can make purchases directly from the device, you can connect it to your Goodreads account, and it even has a modest, built-in web browser.

"3.0 out of 5 stars,""I lost my previous kindle and had to purchase a new one. I thought I was buying the identical product, but what I didn't know is that Amazon had remodeled this item so that it was a little bulkier and, more importantly, felt like cheap plastic in my hands. That last kindle was a little sleeker and had more of a satin kind of finish when you're holding it (which you're going to be doing for an awfully long time if you read a lot.) I would see if I could buy some back-stock of the old model at a similar or perhaps cheaper price if you have the option.Really, the point of this review is to provide Amazon with feedback that they should pay more attention to the feel of kindle in the hand. This thing looks and feels like a piece of cheap junk. It does perform just as well as the previous iteration however, which can't be understated.

It also has parental controls which is a nice touch for those who have kids that like to go purchasing things with 1-click. The set-up is just like the previous generation Kindle Paperwhite, which is very clean and well organized in my personal opinion.The casing feels a bit cheap, it doesn't have the smooth back like the previous generation Kindle did, which I was a fan of. Other than the casing I love the device and would recommend it to anyone looking into an e-reader.

No sound, no read along.-> Except kindle touch, all others have some form of backlight.-> All kindle ereaders have  6"""" gray screenDifferences between kindle ereaders:a. Bezel material. Kindle touch and paperwhite have plastic bezel. Higher end have metal.b. Screen recessed or flush. Kindle touch and paperwhite have recessed screens. Higher end have flush screens.c.

Kindle touch has lowest resolution screen.Kindle Touch - an experience reading over a year.CONSIt does use an older version of e-ink technology, which does have ghosting of previous page during page turns. Ghosting lasts a few seconds ( < 3 seconds), however, with 'page refresh' it can be minimized to <1sec.Screen resolution is low, and you may see pixalation in fonts.No back light (It may be a good thing depending upon how 'white' paper you like).No page turns button.Touch sensitivity turns multiple pages, if not 'touched' quickly enough.Recessed screen is not flush with the bezel, hence there's a gap between screen and bezel that traps dirt. Device does gather dirt and moss over time.While the screen is not reflective, Bezel that is around recessed screen is very reflective, and can be a distraction in reading.Bezel is plastic and easily scratched.Pros:Amazon ereaders allow access to all of RAM to end user. This means users can use all of 3.5 GB space to store their books.Amazon ereaders work well with online library systems such as overdrive.Ereader is very affordable, and is part of amazon eco-system.If properly taken care of, this is best value for casual reading experience.Between paperwhite with back light, and Kindle touch without backlight, kindle touch has more paperlike screen.

I can access daily reflections/prayers and search for the corresponding Bible readings. I can let my son use it to read a picture book (in black and white).  I can increase my vocabulary and story understanding by using the dictionary tool to look up words.  I can connect with friends and read reviews on goodreads.  I can take advantage of the Special Offers which hasn't bothered me at all.  I've had my Kindle since Christmas and have used it everyday since.  It charges quickly using the USB with a wall charger I have for my phone and lasts a week for me reading daily.  The Kindle has allowed me to read several series quickly and  it is nice to immediately have access to the next book.  I like the Kindle Unlimited, for now, but probably won't have it for long since my library has quite a few books I am interested in.  I also have plenty to read with my Prime membership with the free monthly book from the Kindle Owners Lending Library and the Kindle First program.  I am enjoying my Kindle and look forward to many more reading adventures with it!"",Love the KindleTouch and its easy to use features!";;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""Great, small enough to fit in a purse, and the internet connection hasn't had many issues. I haven't had any major problems with this kindle.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I've had my Kindle for a few days now, since the release date, so 5 days total, and so far I absolutely love it. I was skeptical of the touchscreen, but I find that I actually like it much more than the previous Kindle. It has a """"swipe-to-open"""" feature to unlock the device, in addition to the button on the bottom of the device.It's not bad, but I feel it's a bit redundant when there's a button to unlock the device as well. It also has parental controls which is a nice touch for those who have kids that like to go purchasing things with 1-click. The set-up is just like the previous generation Kindle Paperwhite, which is very clean and well organized in my personal opinion.The casing feels a bit cheap, it doesn't have the smooth back like the previous generation Kindle did, which I was a fan of. Other than the casing I love the device and would recommend it to anyone looking into an e-reader.

"3.0 out of 5 stars,""The device itself is fine.  I ended up with this one because my original Kindle would no longer power up.

"3.0 out of 5 stars,""This was my 4th Kindle.  I have been disappointed in this one as the battery doesn't seem to last as long as the one on my Paperwhite, even though it is almost exactly the same except for the back light, which i had assumed would make this last at least as long, if not longer.  With my Paperwhite I was easily able to go a week between chargings, and even then I would have a fair charge left, while with this I get the pop up telling me I need to charge after 5-6 days.  After talking to tech support I turned off the wifi for a couple days, and it still depleted the battery by about half in 3 days.  I have also found the touch screen to be a bit """"touchier"""" than my Paperwhite.  If I am not careful it will flip a couple pages at a time, and I have had issues with it leaning against a blanket and popping up the text resize menu.  For reading the screen is just fine and everything I have come to expect from my Kindles, it is just the issue with the battery and the touchyness of the screen that bugs me.  Oh, and make sure you really don't care about having the lit screen.  I got this thinking I didn't really need it, but it didn't take long before i decided I was missing it.

"2.0 out of 5 stars,""It's usable, but after a week or so's solid use am badly missing my old (non touch screen) Kindle. If you still have a usable one & are thinking to upgrade, keep hold of it until you have tried this version for a while. There are 2 main problems for me, both affect my reading experience daily so far:1. Although smaller, it's significantly heavier and fatter than my old Kindle - this, together with the touch screen rather than button page turning, makes it difficult to read with one hand. If you love to read in bed lying on your side (like me), this is a big issue! There's only one (awkward to hold) position you can use, and you can still find yourself accidentally going backwards rather than forwards or randomly changing the text size or exiting the book without intending to.  Sure, a paper book is hard to read with one hand too, but that's what one of things that made the old Kindle so great, and stopped me buying paper books overnight.2. Very easy to change text size accidentally - happens dailyOn the plus side:The searching in Kindle Store is MUCH easier with touch screen than using the keyboard on old Kindle.Still much prefer the old non touch screen one though, just because the ease of use for reading in one hand is so much better."",Miss my old Kindle...";;;;;;

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""The printing press is one of the major advancements in the history of mankind. Prior to the Internet, it was the innovation that allowed for the sharing of information on a large scale. Books steadily became more affordable and were more widely available read.  We had Carnegie who established a a trust for the construction of Public Libraries, where anyone could access the information that heretofore had been limited editions and expensive to acquire. In the United States, reading became the most cherished of educational acquired skills. Everyone read, it was, and continues to be a major exchange media for news, sports, and in many cases advertising . Every so often an innovation comes along that expands the frontiers of Information. The Kindle is simply the next logical step in the evolution of technology. It retains the look, size and feel of a traditional paperback in size and heft, but it is capable of a veritable library within it's small frame and even more so when """"Cloud"""" storage is considered. The elements of the screen controls (Font Size and Brightness) are literally at your finger tips. It holds a charge for days, you can hold it in one hand quite comfortably and it's heft is no more than a medium sized paperback. It has many more features, all neatly spelled out on the Information Page at  Amazon. What you are looking for is some assurance or feedback from people who actually own a Kindle Paper White. I never intentionally set out to acquire a Kindle, but after sitting on the fence, and looking at the many readers available I went with Amazon Kindle. Why, it was a gift?  So the decision forme was very easy to make. I have no regrets, not one. It is an easy, nearly intuitive process to learn. I have ten """"thumbs"""" but I quickly adjusted to the  feel and touch of the screen. I wouldn't sell it if I was offered the same price I paid.Now if you would throw in a few hundred for it , well I can adjust. I  can also buy another one, pocket the balance, and be quite content. The point is I would buy another one, that's how much I enjoy it. Okay, I won't gush about it. Just buy it, try it, if you read for any length of time, you will soon forget the format you are holding in your hand. Page turning is simply a flick. You only have one page at a time.  I know some folks who were so used to having """"two pages"""" left and right, they were actually uneasy about it. They hung in there and both now own a Kindle. They might of purchased two one for the right hand page and another for the left hand page, which would make them at ease, but I never inquired further.  Now ,wishes...well, all books just ought to have the Kindle version available. It ought to be less expensive. Sure it costs less, but  considering the elimination of long term overhead costs you'd think it would be even less. That's it...One, There should be a Kindle format available for each book. Two, Yes we're greedy, we want more for less. But that's my only negative comments about  the Kindle Formatting and Prices. Hardware functionality, A+. Would I buy another. Yes I would. Would I recommend it to a friend or as a gift for a friend, Yes, with no reservations. There is a lot of Media for no costs to the user. A lot of old books, no longer under copyright which are just as true as they were a hundred years ago(and we still haven't learned a thing in many aspects). There are also free programs that convert PDF into a Kindle or Kindle Paper White format. That will open up opportunities even more books for free. One last thing, pictures will be displayed in Black/White/Gray and that tint of CTR. Don't expect vibrant colors. It's different, but again not a big deal (to me).  Try it, I think you'll enjoy it."",""Makes a great gift, even if you decide to keep it and give them an old restaurant gift card you haven't used instead.""";;;;;;

The Paperwhite is light weight, clear, and easy to read. If you don't care about the back lighting and you want a reader you can carry in a purse or pocket, you'll probably love it. I'm thinking about the $119 model with built in light but I have to wait till I save up the extra money."",""Good product, but not right for me!""";;;;;;

Of course more expensive devices are sleeker and have more goodies: color,  back-lit,  and more functions,  but for the price this is exactly what I wanted to read.  If you read during day or with light on,  you don't need the back light,  but I could see that being valuable.

However,  unlike the older kindle versions, there is no external power source for an easy to carry lighted case which means I have not been able to find a case I like as well as the designs that fit with the previous kindles. I like to read before bed. The lack of backlighting is great for preventing eye strain, but zero visibility in the dark without at least a minimal light source. Any case has to have an external light for dark areas which gets a bit bulky to transport.So overall 5 for the kindle.

I give it four stars because 1) the touchscreen sensitivity is ok, but not as good as it could be (although this is more along the lines of a comparison with a tablet) 2) it won't replace my books: I can't imagine flipping between pages 100 and 350 for example to cross-reference text because the interface is still too clumsy (despite many Go To options).

"4.0 out of 5 stars,""While I've anticipated these things since the mid-1960s, I only bought my first one a couple of weeks ago.  My biggest complaint so far is there doesn't seem to be a Table of Contents.  That's always the first thing you come to in paper--and it's VERY helpful.  I am puzzled why it doesn't appear very first thing when you touch the title of an e-book.  The Shopping Cart had no listing for Religious.  I typed in """"Bibles""""  and picked up a couple, but there should be a listing for them.  Maybe the Geeks and Literary Critics who design these things don't have much to do with religion, but here in the United States candidates for public office never bother attending an athiest convention and seldom bother with ones on philosophy or literature--but they ALWAYS make it a point to attend churches and make sure the cameras are rolling when they do.  They may not be terribly religious themselves--but they know an awful lot of people are and they DARE NOT neglect that group.  So neglecting them in your shopping cart is a bit of an oversight--don't you think?  Otherwise it's okay--except that for decades now pocket calculators have had solar cells, so how is it the e-book reader neglects them?  There is one thing I would find laughable about the Kindle if it were not so frustrating, and that is the QWERTY keyboard it displays:  One must hunt-and-peck all over the place to find the letters.  I suppose to an unthinking engineer a QWERTY like that used on computers would seem reasonable, but to anyone who understands how and why the QWERTY came to be it is rediculous.  Back when typewriters were first invented there were two basic philosophies on keyboards:  One was ABCDEFG while those familiar with the printing trade favored some form of ETAOIN SRDLU--the order of how frequently the latters were used.  The Problem was that the slow movement of the mechanical connections used on manual typewriters allowed the keys to jam up.  The QWERTY keyboard deliberately slowed down the typist's fingers so that the keys did not jam up.  Since the Kindle does not use jam-prone mechanically-linked arms and since QWERTY-trained human fingers do not rest on the keyboard it would make much more sence for the Kindle to use an ABCDEFG keyboard so that people will be able to find they keys they are looking for."",Kindle Okay--but Neglects the Obvious";;;;;;

An ant crawled up on it (they apparently appreciate Feynman also) and I watched in amazement, as the thing stepped over letters on the screen. The pages began to turn! The things carry just enough electricity (or whatever the mechanism) that a touchscreen will register their movement as user actions! In the spirit of Feynman, I proved that it's reproducible.

And space is quite a commodity if you are riding a flight with Spirit or Frontier. Trust me you will want that kindle, with your ziplock bag of a carryon.The kindle is also excellent in the sense that it has its own light source.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I'm hoping this will save you some frustration and trouble when it's time for you to synch up your new Kindle with your home Wi-Fi service.During this process,  right after you select your applicable Wi-Fi provider from the list displayed on the Kindle's screen,  it's going to ask you to type in the """"password"""" from your Wi-Fi setup.  Now,  I had made specific note of such a password at the time I installed my Wi-Fi service a few years ago, and was glad to see that I had saved that information,  but when I typed the password into the Kindle as prompted,  it rejected it.  Eventually,  I figured out that what the Kindle was looking for (even though it used the word """"password"""") was actually a ten-digit number shown on a sticker right across the side of my Wi-Fi router unit,  designated on the sticker as """"Network Key"""",  rather than the password that I had written down.  When I typed the Network Key number into the Kindle,  it was accepted instantly,  and all was well from there.

I would like to see a little more customization possibilities on the system level (especially regarding power saving features, wifi sleep options, etc.) but I'm sure these will come in future generations and everything essential is already included.  The battery lasts me about 2 weeks with about 1.5-2 hours of reading per day (I read fairly fast and I suspect all these extra page turns per hour are responsible for the slightly shorter battery life than others report). The free dictionaries which are included are a huge added bonus and many classic out-of-copyright books can be downloaded for free from either Amazon directly or from third party collections such as Project Gutenberg.

"4.0 out of 5 stars,""Printed instructions need to be included with the Kindle to assist the purchaser in getting  things set up.

"3.0 out of 5 stars,""I just replaced my older Kindle (version 3 w/keyboard), and here are the pros/cons from that perspective:ProsThe touch screen is intuitive and makes navigating much easierthe contrast appears to be sharper and the image quality is betterit's smaller, but not too smallNot too bright so it doesn't hurt your eyes (always good with the basic Kindle models)ConsIt doesn't feel as well made. It has flimsier material that feels cheap and easily breakable. I understand that lighter is better but not if it results in a shorter product life.Slightly thickernot likely to last as long with all the screen touching, especially if it is e-ink.It is too small for a generation 3 cover (to be expected, but now I have to make some alterations to my leather case)If you are looking for something simple that you don't care about kicking around, this works. I am a little bummed at this new Kindle. It's not as solid as the older ones, but it's not awful.*Also, I went from no ads to ads because I thought I wouldn't mind and well, I do. That's my own fault though. If anyone out there is thinking about going with the special offers and has been without it, know this: Besides the screensaver, the ads are a bottom banner even on your home page."",Eh.";;;;;;
5.0 out of 5 stars,This was a replacement for my older generation Kindle.  I love this one as much as the version I had previously.  Easy to use and easy on the eyes while reading during the day.  Not easy to find a lighted cover to fit it for night reading however.,Great readability;;;;;;
"4.0 out of 5 stars,""Like the screen, a bit too much tech stuff for this senior to absorb i.e. page numbers, timing how fast you read, etc., a bit much for this senior reader.Still not sure how I get the book to the cloud when I am finished with it. Disappointed that when I asked to remove the promotional items I had to pay over $20 for that to happen. As an octogenarian I'm pretty much aware of what I like to read so reading suggestions are not appreciated and certainly not needed yet I had to pay to have them disappear.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I bought this Kindle in order to expand my reading horizon.  These days, some books are only available electronically, and I wouldn't want to miss out on them.  I enjoy having the choice of all the many text features, from font type and size, line spacing, margin area, and portrait or landscape mode. These make the reading flow well.  Also, the non-glare screen is kind to the eyes.  I've also used the ''experimental browser'' for basic functions such as e-mail and looking at some online only news publications.  It works well for this.  There are still features I'm looking forward to using, such as the dictionary, highlighting and social network sharing of what I've read on my Kindle.  In this basic Kindle, I don't know if it might be possible to have a contrast feature for darkening/lightening screen and/or text.

My eyes have gradually worsened from overusing my phone so the break from the backlight is appreciated. It's just like a normal book and you can read that in the dark. I can only recommend that you order a case with this. I have two cats and even though I kept it in the box when I wasn't using it I noticed that cat hair was accumulating along the edges of the screen. I would buy this again if I had the need.,Perfect;;;;;;

"3.0 out of 5 stars,""Thanks to all the informative reviewers who go into such great detail, and really help folks to make informed decisions about buying a new Kindle.  I have a question for folks who have one of the newer Kindles (either the 'plain' """"6 inch touchscreen display--the $79 model, or the newest Paperwhite). One of the things I loved about my plain old kindle (the older one without keyboard, with built in light) was the ability to read WITHOUT being online, in """"airplane mode"""".  So no annoying pop up features and such interrupting my reading.  I know Amazon proudly touts all the fabulous things the latest and greatest Kindles do with wifi, but unless I'm downloading a book, wanting to look up a word, etc., I really don't want to be online.  Can anyone tell me if the newest plain Kindle and the Paperwhite both (or either) have ability to turn off wifi for reading a book that has been downloaded???

This device was on sale but I delayed purchasing it and when I went to order it was back to its original price of $79.00. I still think it was a good deal for me because I have already read 2 books and I've been able to carry it in my purse when I want to take a book with me to an appointment. It is lightweight  and relatively compact. An English teacher at heart, I DO prefer a 'real' book but the ease of the Kindle is great in certain circumstances."",A Great Purchase";;;;;;

"3.0 out of 5 stars,""I feel like there are pros and cons with this device.I love the idea of an e-reader, and when I purchased this e-reader, my thought was to use it with Amazon Prime which we had just purchased. I thought that if I bought the reader with prime, that you have access to billions of books.Untrue.What the websites don't make blatantly clear is that most of the books you want to read aren't available in prime. And you only get to check out one book per month. That makes a BIG difference. Now if you want to get a subscription to kindle, you can have access to more books. But you are gonna spend 9.99 per month to still not be able to read all the books you want.As far as the reader goes.I do like it. It is easy on the eyes. And very simple. Nothing fancy. No headphones. But, don't buy the reader with specials. With specials means that there are annoying ads on your lock screen.So, I figured out a way to not pay for books and check them from the library. It's round about and not simple.But it's free.And I am cheap. I hope amazon doesn't take that away. I am keeping the e-reader. It's so light weight in hand, that it is enjoyable to use."",Hope this helps.";;;;;;

"3.0 out of 5 stars,""Disappointed in Amazon """"Help"""" more than with my new Kindle (7th gen, 6"""" Glare-Free Touchscreen Display).  Amazon USED to have superior service";" sadly no more.My issue is that games/active content that I had bought for my old Kindle (2nd gen) don't work on my new Kindle when I specifically asked that question before I purchased the new Kindle.  I LOVED my old Kindle, but the paging has gone haywire, so I contacted Chat and asked them to make a recommendation.  I only had 2 requirements:  love the screen on my old Kindle so wanted the same screen (nothing lighter or that lights up) and want to be able to play the games (Brain Trainer, Scrabble, (EA) Solitaire, etc.).  The guy immediately recommended this Kindle.  I pointed out to him that on my old Kindle I had a physical keyboard with a control button-- which is used to play the games but didn't appear to be on this new Kindle.  He put me on hold to check and came back confirming I would be able to play the games.  Great!  But WRONG.  Multiple emails, chat sessions and phone calls, and frustrating days later, I finally got the truth:  my games/active content won't work on this new Kindle.Now they did reimburse the cost of my games, but as I pointed out to them to no avail, were bought when on sale or for free and for me to buy new versions of games that will work on my 7th gen Kindle, I won't be able to for the amount they were refunding me.This whole thing could have been avoided if Amazon's personnel was properly trained (knowledgeable) on their products.I could almost understand one individual making a mistake, but unfortunately for me, I ended up emailing, calling and chatting with multiple individuals who couldn't (or wouldn't?) directly answer my questions . . . which makes me a very unhappy customer.Now my actual experience with this new Kindle is just okay.  The """"touch"""" function needs some fine tuning";" paging doesn't work as expected all the time (could be operator error).  This is going to be a challenge because the tablet is small:  I'm going to have to train myself not to accidentally have a finger or part of my hand on the screen when holding it because that does impact the """"touch"""" functionI love the """"Smart Lookup"""" (dictionary) and """"Vocabulary Builder""""-- brilliant ideas for word nerds like me!  (I need to experiment more with """"Word Wise"""" and """"X-Ray""""";" might enjoy them too.)Page numbers are nice, but I initially was confused by them because I thought a page was skipped-- page numbers relate back to the paper book's physical page so the Kindle's font size can impact whether you display more (or less) than a physical page.I haven't found the """"Voice"""" (read aloud) function on this Kindle and maybe it doesn't have it . . . which would be disappointing because I did enjoy that on my 2nd gen Kindle.In some books I've never read before, sections are highlighted-- I haven't figured out why . . . but it's not going to stop me from enjoying reading on my Kindle!  :)"",Amazon Customer Service is now Horrible!

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I started with the Kindle Keyboard and loved it, but I broke 4.  The glass was very fragile.  My sister gave me a Kindle touchscreen for Christmas.  I fought using it for months, I wanted my Keyboard. I finally HAD to use the touchscreen, and I am converted.  This is not fragile. It does not require a cover just to keep from breaking the screen.  The weight is nothing, the battery lasts and last.  It charges fast. The resolution is good.  I would really like to have 3G, but it is not required.  I personally own 2 working Kindle Keyboards , 1 working small Kindle and one large Kindle color tablets. All are really good products, but for reading books the touchscreen is unbeatable so far.  Good work Amazon."",""I started with the Kindle Keyboard and loved it, but I broke 4""";;;;;;

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I got it because it is cheap and has twice the memory of my previous kindle. I paid $20 extra to avoid having the advertisements";" I HATE the advertisements.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I bought this kindle on a Thanksgiving deal for $50 and received in two days. A very quick delivery, and I rate 5 stars for the service category.The product packaging is very good, this kindle comes with no wall charger, but with a USB cable. The cable can be used to connect to a laptop to transfer content and/or charge the kindle. No wall charger for a $80 product is certainly a minus, but it is not a deal breaker as kindle uses a micro USB port, so it is not hard to find a charger. Any micro USB charger would work just fine.  For goodies I give 4 stars.Like any consumer electronic item, this review discusses Hardware, Software and Eco System (content you use on the kindle)Hardware: The kindle is nicely built with hard plastic and is light weight, but feels durable. The Kindle feels great in hand and you certainly don't need any protective cover, so please don't waste money on cases or covers. I said hard plastic, yes the kindle made with  hard plastic ( e.g: PVC plastic pipe), but not soft plastic (e.g: Nokia smart phones). So, the kindle aesthetics are bad and it looks very cheap, however the device doesn't feel any cheap in hand. The bezels are wide enough for a nice grip and the device is comfortable to hold. The design is very minimal and it is a good thing. It just have a power button and a battery charging LED indicator. The LCD display for reading is fantastic. It is certainly not like reading a paper book, but it is a very nice way of reading e books with no eye strain. Make sure you have ample light on Kindle screen. Rating: 4 stars. [hard plastic and lack of wall charger ate 1 point]Software: The software of Kindle is very top notch. Just touch a word, it shows the meaning and how to use it with an example. The same word is added to a list [ Amazon calls it Vocabulary builder], so that you could also check it later. There are lots of useful features to make you a better reader. Everything is great on a Kindle, except the advertisements. The screen always shows an advertisement when you are not using the device, so the screen is never turned off. Amazon claims it doesn't use battery, but I will discuss that later.  These advertisements change based on your amazon activity and your computer browser activity [know how cookies work?] The truth is your device is an advertisement display for Amazon.Rating: 4 Stars [ Get rid of advertisements on Kindle - we buy these to read, not to look at advertisements]Eco System: Eco System is nothing but, what you can buy to have on your Kindle. The e books and cases for kindle etc..There are couple of E book standards, such as epub, PDF, ibook (Apple's), docx (Microsoft word document), azw ( mobi based format). Amazon uses azw, which is based on mobi ebook standard. epub is widely supported ebook format, however everybody now also supporting Amazon's format. Your local library may also supports kindle format, but almost all ebook libraries do support epub format.Being said that, it is not hard to find a book on Amazon, so you are covered. If you want some old classic books for free [not protected from patent, as these books matured the time duration], search Gutenberg project on your computer. This website do have lots of good ebooks in kindle format, so you can download and email to your kindle e mail account to read on Kindle.Rating: 5 starsI would recommend this product to buy."",Piece of Art";;;;;;

"3.0 out of 5 stars,""My name is Readz Alot.  And I am a biblioholic.I had held off on buying any sort of e-reader for many years.  I like BOOKS.  I like holding books and handling books and reading books. I like being able to flip back 20 pages to check a fact, or flip forward to easily see how many pages are left in the chapter.  I like being able to quickly skim a section that is less interesting and move on.When this Kindle went on sale just before Christmas, I gave in and bought it, figuring I'd mostly use it for free e-books from sites like Project Gutenburg and Pulp Archive and, in general, for books that are completely unavailable or outlandishly priced in physical format.That is, indeed what I have, mostly used it for. I've purchased only a handful of books from Amazon's kindle store, and most of those still fall into the 'old and hard to find' category. Others are 99 cent megapacks.  And that that purpose, I mostly like it.  Though it does have all the downsides listed above.  It's hard to flip back to check a fact.  The 'time to end of the chapter' is often quite inaccurate, and doesn't work at all on many free-books.  And, probably not the Kindle's fault, but some free books simply don't seem to work well in the Mobi format, and end up looking like gibberish on the screen.The biggest downside though is the battery life.  One of the things that finally tempted me to buy it was the claim of 'weeks'/'up to 4 weeks' battery life.  Hah.  While I rarely read for more than 1-2 hours a day (I also, of course, continue to read physical books), even with the wi-fi off, I'm down to half a charge within a couple of days.  """"Up to"""" is right.The other downside is that, for a biblioholic, the temptation to add 'just one more book ... it's free/only 99 cents' is so powerful.

"2.0 out of 5 stars,""I have been a kindle owner for over 3 years now.  I have been extremely happy with my first kindle.  You see, I am an amputee.  I lost my right arm in a car accident.  I am also a person who uses a bus to commute each day to my job in Seattle.  So receiving my first kindle as a gift from my sister was a big advantage because of the awkward struggle it is to try and read a paperback or hardbound book with only one hand.Recently, something happened and about 80% of my screen stopped working and the display has a random collection of pixels showing that never change.  I contacted Amazon and reported the problem.  You promptly sent me, and charged me for, a replacement kindle.Well, I have to tell you that I am very frustrated.  My former kindle was a kindle keyboard.  What was most advantageous was the buttons on each side of the device that would page forward or page back.  The buttons being on each side meant that you could easily use it with one hand, whether it be the left hand or the right hand.I realize that having only one hand puts me in a small group of your customer base.  I further realize that having only a left hand is further minimizing my needs into a smaller demographic of e-book readers, but here are my observations:• The black portion of the device that constitutes the frame can easily be held from the back, but then I cannot reach the screen for the required finger swipe.• I can “pinch” the black case between my thumb and fingers, but that leaves my thumb as the only finger that can “swipe” or “tap” at the screen to change the page.• Releasing the device to change the page makes the device “balanced” on my remaining fingers, so I am anticipating that this device will end up being dropped to the floor much more frequently than my former (and much more useful) kindle device.I do understand the futility in hoping for a “de-evolution” of your kindle line, and I am not ignorant of how few “lefty’s” there are in your customer base.  I just needed to clarify why I will be looking across the market of readers to see if there is a better device to meet my particular needs.  I do want you to know that if this situation did not exist, I would remain a satisfied kindle customer and user."",Not all chsanges are good for me.";;;;;;

"3.0 out of 5 stars,""Kindle is a good e-reader with a touchscreen display that reads like a real paper with no screen glare, even in bright sunlight. It is light weight and has excellent battery life. One of my observation is that there is a very slight delay for the text to appear when we move from a page to another. I have seen this only in kindle e-reader. My Ectaco reader does not have this delay. I personally prefer a much bigger e-reader which I believe will make the reading much more easier.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""In the week that I've had my Kindle E-Reader, I have fallen hopelessly in love with it. It honestly might be an obsession! Switching to the nook from this, I found the display SO much easier to navigate than the nook. Also, the E-Reader is perfect for someone who, like me, just wants a kindle for the book aspect. I don't need something to watch movies on, or plays games with. I just needed something to store and read eBooks on, and the E-Reader met those needs fantastically! Also, I have found many FREE book I have enjoyed, and the prices of the books reasonable and somewhat cheaper than buying hard copies, ordering off a website, or even purchasing off the nook.

I also like it because it's easy to hold and doesn't hurt my hands when I read for long periods of time.,Love my Kindle;;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""Easy to read on, works great in bright sunlight, and battery life is excellent. You do have to get used to the screen going black for a moment when switching pages and navigating menu's but the other E-Readers I've had do the same.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""This basic model fits my needs. I have an iPad, but found that for reading books over an extended period, you just can't beat this device. It's easier to hold, I don't have to contend with screen glare, it's easier on the eyes, and syncs effortlessly with the Kindle app on my Apple devices. I don't have other distractions since this is just an eReader, which means I can concentrate more on what I'm reading. I can also read at night with no problems trying to fall asleep afterwards. I couldn't do that as easily after reading on my iPad mini.  A $5 book light that clips on devices works just fine when I need it.  I really like how it connects with Goodreads and now keep up with it more than I did before. Audible app syncs well with the Kindle and allows me to continue reading a book right where it left off in the audio version. I'm very happy with this basic touch screen model.  Love it!"",I couldn't do that as easily after reading on my iPad mini";;;;;;
"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I love my new kindle!!! It's the first one I've bought, the first one I had was a hand me down.  I didn't think I would like a kindle being an avid reader and book lover but since I had a free one second generation I gave it a try and fell in love.  Gone are the bi-weekly trips to the library, lugging around arm loads of heavy books some of which I didn't have time to read or just didn't like and occasionally had previously read also the fines.  For readers like my self I recommend a paper white version I have over a thousand books on my new one already.  Most of which I got free, I don't think I have spent over five dollars on one yet.  The kindle unlimited is the way to go also.  I almost cried when I dropped my first one and broke it, I had dropped the thing a hundred times, literally.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""I Absolutely Love my Kindle !!!!!!  It was given to me as a gift for Christmas.............. What an absolute treat it's been.

I'm trying the Kindle Unlimited"""" plan to hopefully catch up with reading some of the things I missed in the last number of years.  I'm so thankful to my Friend Kathleen who gifted the Kindle to me ...... I couldn't be happier :))))))))))P.S.  This Kindle doesn't have backlighting - so I can't read in the dark.

Furthermore, there are very few good options for cases that include a light, and none I could find that were slim and light and drew power from the kindle battery like in previous models.

4.0 out of 5 stars,This is exactly what I expected.  A light easy to use product.  The battery lasted at least a month.

"4.0 out of 5 stars,""This has been great so far! I purchased the kindle for 69.99, bought 6 months of Kindle Unlimited for $30, and I bought the charger head for $15 (just the cord is included, you have to buy the part the plugs into an outlet separate).Negatives:- Kindle Unlimited does not include a lot of books that are popular or in demand. I have a booklist of around 50 books that I would like to read and only 5-6 are available for free through Kindle Unlimited (and those are the older books on my list, none of the current top sellers are included). So disappointed with the selection and probably will not purchase again at the end of 6 months.-This kindle does not include a light which means that you will need to have an actual light on to read this just as if you were reading a regular book. I didnt think this would bother me but it has turned in to a bit of a pain and lightening would have been nice when needed (for example: when taking the metro to work and the lightening isnt great)- When you turn the kindle off it defaults to an advertisement. I know that is a small thing but I don't like being bombarded with ads 24/7 especially when the device is supposed to be OFF.- I purchased these items directly from my bank account and and received the kindle and charger in two days with amazon prime. The info for the Kingle Unlimited was supposed to be sent to my via email. I never received the email so on the third day after purchase I called to make sure everything was ok. I spoke to a woman on the help line who said there was a delay but it was processing and that she would call me the next day to follow up with me. I didnt receive a phone call back from here on the fourth day after purchase so on the fifth day I called back to follow up. Sidenote: I was anxiously awaiting reading on my new kindle!!!! When I called back I was told that the delay was that I had paid for my purchase with a bank account and to buy the Kindle Unlimited you have to use a credit card. So I told her to just charge it to the credit card they had on file but because this was a bundle item she couldn't do it. So instead I had to go online and buy the Kindle Unlimited for $60 and then she refunded me the extra $30. Suffice to say this was a big headache and I was on the phone sorting all this out for almost an hour. It should be posted at purchase that this needs to be bought with a credit card! Plus side, she gave me a $10 credit applied to my amazon account for future purchases.- you have to be the charger head seperate. This left a bad taste in my mouth. I have to pay $15 extra dollars to be able to charge my kindle at an outlet (as opposed to just having the cord to plug into a computer). I felt like this was a cheap move on Amazon's part.-Also, this is literally just a device to buy and read books. To my knowledge, you can not access the internet to go to other websites etc.Positives:- The kindle is directly linked to your amazon account so buying books is done with just a click of the button. You can also create book lists to save for purchase later.- When you are reading a book on the kindle you can highlight words/passages, you can click on a word to see the definition, you can click on the name of a character to get info on them if you forget who they are (very helpful when reading a more complicated book), and it is pretty easy to navigate.-You can adjust the size of the font as needed.-It's a good size that is large enough to be about the size of a paperback book but small enough to easily carry around. It is much lighter than the more advanced (more expensive) kindles as well.Overall, I really like the kindle.

"4.0 out of 5 stars,""Love my new Kindle!  I sometimes find holding a book difficult and painful, and after trying my daughter's Kindle, I thought a Kindle would be helpful.  My daughter gave me one as an early birthday gift and I'm now reading a few hours everyday, just like I used to do. Adjusting the print size is a plus and although I'm a bit clumsy with the touch screen, I'm getting the hang of it.  The Kindle is right up there with the top 5 gifts I have ever received."",Love my new Kindle";;;;;;
"1.0 out of 5 stars,""I hate, hate, hate this product!!!! Like other customer reviews bring back the old Kindle with the buttons on the bottom and page turner buttons on the side. This touchscreen is a load of crap and you're paying more just for junk and advertisements you don't need or will use. To get started you are forced to sign up for Kindle Prime. If I had wanted that I would have signed up for it but I didn't need or want it so didn't sign up for it so wasn't happy I was forced to sign up for it to just start my Kindle. This continuous tapping to change pages is the biggest nuisance  and I have acrylic nails so it sounds like a swarm of termites on a eating binge with this continuous tapping. I travel and fly a lot for my job. I will now have to book my seat on the wing of the plane because with this continuous tapping to change pages it will annoy other passengers on the plane and they might throw me, my Kindle or both out the emergency exit. I found it very difficult to navigate to get where you need to be to read what you downloaded. I found the text difficult to read through all the smudges and handprints left through using a touch screen. I don't even like touchscreen computers! All this swiping and tapping to go back and forth you like something between an idiot and bird in flight. Someone could make a good music video showing how dumb you look doing all this swiping and tapping. I just hate it when you get use to a good product that you really enjoyed, I really liked my old basic Kindle with the buttons on the bottom and buttons on the side and had it with me everywhere I went, and they decide to upgrade and it's a load of crap and you can't go back to the old one. Like others stated if you want a Kindle you're stuck with these whether you like it or not and I absolutely hate it with a passion but I'm stuck with it because I like reading a Kindle. We should get a dissatisfied customer discount for having to purchase an inferior product to read a Kindle."",HATE KINDLE TOUCHSCREEN!!!!";;;;;;

Also, it is very tedious to shop in the Kindle store, as one must go sequentially through the listings. As one who buys 15 to 20 books per month, I would like some way, other than listing a specific author, to be able to go further in the list without simply turning page after page after page."",The device is easy to navigate and easy to read";;;;;;

I was told that with my $100/yr prime membership plus the $2.99/mo, that my son would be able to read for no additional charge anything marked """"kindle unlimited"""" - that is not true. You get a very small set of books, most of which are too basic/young for an 8 year old for $2.99/month. To get just some of the books he wants, you need the full $9.99/mo subscription. Which is fine, but that is not what I was told before I bought it. Books don't consistently show up on it either - some showed up on my sons kindle, some of my son's books showed up on mine.

"4.0 out of 5 stars,""I'm writting this review because I really like Kindle, but I think that it has some good and bad points. As to the good points: it is light weighted, easy to take to places, has a high memory capacity, it makes it easier to carry a lot of books at the same time. As to the bad points: for me, the worse thing is that Kindle doesn't have an option where you can invert the lights, so when you are in a dark place you can't read. I understand that it is supposed to be like an actual book, but as a customer, if i am choosing to buy an eletronic book, rather than an actual book, it is because I want more reading options.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""UPDATE: (12/10/15) Now that I've ready about a dozen books on my Kindle with no software glitches whatsoever, I must assume that the initial problems I dealt with were resolved by one of the automatic updates. All the features have been working perfectly for the past 4 months and I now appreciate the Kindle even more than my Nook, thus I must update my review to 5-star since that's exactly how the Kindle has been working for me. It's virtually transparent when engrossed in a novel, but quick and responsive whenever you need to look up a word, find an explanation on Wikipedia, or highlight text. Excellent product!UPDATE:  (8/11/15) After initially posting a 2-star review (see below) based on my serious frustration due to having to reboot the device about one out of every three times I attempted to use the dictionary look-up or highlight features while reading, I have decided that when it DOES work properly, it's a fabulous reading device. I do actually like the way it functions slightly better than my Nook, and it's quite a bit more responsive (as it should be compared to a 5-year-old product). Overall, it's a well designed piece of hardware and if it weren't for the fact that I cringe a little bit every time I try to look up or highlight something, I would be giving it a 5-star rating. As this is an operating system issue it can be easily resolved, so I will give Amazon the benefit of the doubt on this one and hope that it gets resolve with the next firmware release. Until then I maintain that my 1st generation Nook still works more reliably.***This thing works... sort of. Compared to my first generation Nook it's complete garbage. On my Nook I could actually use the highlights and dictionary lookup features. With this piece of crap if you try to use any of those features it just freezes up so you have no choice but to reboot it. The hardware is fine, hence 2 stars instead of one, but the firmware/software is RIDICULOUSLY buggy for what I would consider to be an established product. Seriously Amazon, crap like this should have been eliminated my now. Why does my 1st generation Nook work better???

4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice little e-reader for the price. The only thing that is disappointing is the Free-Time option which is one of the main reasons I bought it. What happens is all your books load into the Free-Time and then you check the box for the book(s) you ant in there but according to the manual you can delete the books off the list so you don't have to sort through the tens or hundreds you have. I tried to delete the books I wanted in there plus worked with customer service on this and they said you can't delete the books even though it says so in the manual. Otherwise I would give it a 5 star and after I use it more I will do another update as it's only been a week of use.,Nice little e-reader for the price;;;;;;

Not sure if I'd purcahse another because of the trouble this is causing...looking into Kobo for future purcahses but all in all, reading and purcahsing books while the device is connected to wifi, it's great."",Nice but MAJOR wifi connection problems";;;;;;

"3.0 out of 5 stars,""The big bonus is that this Kindle model is very light and portable and was very easy to set up. The price point was appealing too. The downside is that even in daylight or in a normal-lit room in the evening, the display is not bright enough for my eyes to adjust comfortably. There is no back-lighting setting (ie. no brightness adjustment) on this Kindle and it is not entirely glare-free. I was hoping to take it on my camping excursions or to be able to read at night in my bed. However, a fully-lit room or an overhead reading lamp will be necessary.

"1.0 out of 5 stars,""I really liked my earlier model, which broke after 14 months, now you have really screwed up with this model of Kindle. Some objections include: when accessing the list of already purchased books, you have to sift through the illegible """"book covers"""" for the titles,  3-6 at a time, which are interspersed with """"recommended purchases"""" which you can accidentally buy--since you can't read the title anyway on half of the """"book covers"""" anyway. Seems a guise it encourage additional purchases, accidentally.  The efficient text listing of previously purchased books utilized on the previous model was MUCH betterAlso, any random touch on the device may change the page perhaps tens of even hundreds of pages ---and finding the original site where you left off is very cumbersome at best--IF you can find it without re-reading half a dozen chapters to see where you wereThere are also some other minor complaints, but basically, it seems you took a good device which was working well, and screwed it up !!!Also, in an apparent effort to manipulate customers into subscribing to the """"Kindle Unlimited """" deal, the prices on individual books purchased have abruptly and dramatically increased.So take my advice--if you have not purchased a Kindle, DON'T--stick with books."",I really liked my earlier model";;;;;;
"3.0 out of 5 stars,""Its fine, its a Kindle, but can't say I like the touchscreen.

"1.0 out of 5 stars,""As far as I'm concerned,it's a piece of junk.  The first thing I noticed was that it refused to show me all the books I had purchased.

I managed to open a book and got it somewhere near the page I had been reading on my old kindle, but the dictionary kept popping up when not required and I couldn't get rid of it.  Everything froze.  I couldn't turn pages in either direction, I couldn't call up the home page, I couldn't even turn the machine off - when I tried, the page with the frozen dictionary would still be on the kindle and it stayed there.  When I tried to turn it off a second time and possibly reset the thing, the same page with the dictionary was still there.  Nothing I touched would coax it to leave.  I tried to turn it off again and a popup shot up in front of the dictionary and asked me if I wanted to cancel, restart or produce a blank page, but I couldn't do any of those things.  It just sat there and wouldn't go away.  The page wouldn't turn, the home banner at top wouldn't appear -- nothing worked.  I couldn't get rid of the dictionary and then a ''wise word'' screen showed covering up the dictionary and it wouldn't go away.I would ask you to replace this trash if I wasn't worried about getting another just like it.

"1.0 out of 5 stars,""After lugging around a 10.1"""" tablet for nearly 5 years now, and hacking new versions of Android on it just so I could continue to update software I realised that it was time to upgrade my hardware. This decision was only decided after receiving a nice bonus from work and finally justifying a technology upgrade after hour upon hour of internet research. I decided to go with something advertised as having a long battery life and built to serve the same purpose as my dieing 10.1"""" Tablet that was so old it could only really be used to read books. That old hacked relic still works though mind you. I work offshore and often we do not have the luxuries of TV or internet available when weather is bad and books suffice the only form of entertainment available next to twiddling your thumbs until you go out of your mind. Even when weather is good I can only handle taking hours for a section of Facebook to load due to slow satellite internet speeds. Prior to my most current venture offshore (now as I write this) I was ordering a new XPS13 to replace my also dieing antique Intel atom powered netbook. Low and behold I see an advertisement for a payment plan to get a Kindle. So I say what the hell adding a measly 15$ to a well researched and high-cost laptop purchase isn't going to break the bank. All of this occurred prior to going back to work. What joy I had when receiving the new toys to replace the old stone age relics I was lugging around for entertainment. Not to mention the weight reduction with modern devices when carrying them in my backpack while on deck. I tested both devices to confirm their functionality to determine if I would need to send anything back before embarking on airline flights, bus routes, and a helicopter ride before being trapped out at sea with only books and a handful of movies on a hard drive. So I plugged the Kindle into my brand new laptop and uploaded the novels, Dungeon Master's Guide, and PDFs of useful technical manuals for my work (I'm an electrical technician) from my tablet to the Kindle. Everything worked, I was able to test both devices simultaneously. So after opening a couple books I confirmed it is certainly a thing that does make books happen. Packed it up and prepared for the long journey and after my wife dropped me off to the airport and I made through TSA without being too molested I open my bag to continue reading George R.R. Martin's Feast For Crows...the Kindle only displays screen artifacts. No soft-reset attempts work or help. No amount of charging throughout the trip from my 2.1A battery pack help...I won't get those 18 hours of agonizing boredom back. I did however try charging it from the wall outlet nearly 12 more hours when arriving to my ship with no further change or improvement and have begun the Amazon troubleshooting process so we will see how that goes...but I am still on the fence on whether I want to feed it to the sharks or not. Considering our internet connection while in the middle of the ocean is 56K dial-ups ugly cousin it may very well be that by the time this review posts i may be back on shore or an aging man retiring from a career of offshore work who knows, but if I am able to get through to Amazon and work something out I will update this further.Meanwhile Forever Yours,Long time Amazon Prime Shopper and enthusiast...disappointed by latest future book technology."",First-Time Kindle Owner...not too impressed.";;;;;;

I bought this version -without the build-in light- because I though that this feature could be replaced reading on open air and/or with light, but i was wrong.

4.0 out of 5 stars,Love the ability to have multiple books on my person at any time.  great for someone who is reading a number of books at the same time. One comment to improve is that the browser can not download PDFs but if you have full feature computer you can download and transfer the files to it.  Also a default option for showing larger versions of illustrations in books.  In certain cases you can tap on image and it will open a full screen version and in other instances it will move to next page.,Love it and some suggestions for features.;;;;;;
"1.0 out of 5 stars,""After charging the device, I attempted for nearly an hour to use the touchscreen keyboard and register it. Unfortunately, when I touched a letter or number, either (1) nothing happened, or (2) the correct key was highlighted but one NEXT to it on the screen was input!  After too-many-to-count times of using the back arrow key to erase and start over, I finally got my user name and password onscreen. Would you say that is not very effective use of my time?Well, it got WORSE. When I pressed the correct Wi-fi network for my home, the one BELOW it on the screen was input and using the back arrow did nothing.I phoned Amazon Kindle support, and the agent told me I'd have to download the software (which she said wasn't loaded into the Kindle) onto my computer, and then load it into the Kindle via USB. After about ten minutes more of frustration (with nothing online where she told me it would be and her suggesting I change USB ports), I told her I no longer wanted a Kindle. I have better uses for my time. If I want to read an e-book, I'll read it on my laptop (which performs as it should).I am returning it for a refund today."",I don't recommend this device.";;;;;;

The dual-sided page turners made reading using just one hand a breeze.  A tragic beverage spill recently rendered this device unusable, and I was heartbroken.  That sorrow was increased when I discovered only touchscreen devices are now available.  Having read reviews from numerous customers like myself, I believe Amazon would be wise to come out with a paper-look reader that has both touch options as well as the manual page turners and cursor toggle.  Until then, I guess I'll hope for a miraculous recovery for my Kindle w/keyboard."",""Golden rule: don't """"fix"""" what isn't broken""";;;;;;

Perhaps, they could have provided a larger screen by narrowing the bezel at the bottom? (ii) I would have liked audio pronunciation of words in the dictionary. Of course, this would require audio functionality and a speaker but that would be a worthwhile addition. (iii) Allow use of multiple accounts for sharing within a family. My wife has prime membership, I don't, but to use prime benefits, I would have to de-register Kindle from my account (where I have many books) and register with wife's account.

I looked in all the settings and there is no way to adjust it.  As for it sensing the ambient light, all I can say is I tried it in everything from dark to bright lighting and it was terrible, plus the clarity of images was no good at all.I bought this for a (nearly) 7 year old, to try to make reading more fun, but it is so visually unpleasant that I did not even show it to him for fear that it would make him hate reading forever.

For my boys, after 3-4 hours of reading over 3 days, they have to recharge.

The original Kindle's will last weeks on a single charge as long as there is no wi-fi connected. I love this for long plane rides, which my family often endures.  Amazon took what had to be the most simple user experience for someone that just wants to be able to read books, without having to store all those paper books in their home, and made it the most complicated little machine to do so. It has so many """"extras"""" that link back to Amazon in some way, mostly to purchase books or join programs (this is not including """"ads"""" which are just junk and I would strongly suggest removing from the device if you haven't already done so, you can do this after you buy them for  20 extra dollars). I get that, Amazon wants to make money and make the device seem """"in tune"""" with the user. Over time these features may prove to be useful, and with time it will become easier to navigate through the rabbit hole that is the """"Settings"""" area but for now, it's just an overly complex system to have someone download and read a book.

"2.0 out of 5 stars,""People have written so many thousands of reviews on Kindle that I am going to confine my review to a few key points:  This is my third Kindle.  I put off buying one for a long time.  While I treasure """"real"""" books, the practical realities of modern life, complete with frequent moves and family and friends around the globe, make having 300 books at my fingertips priceless.  I got my Paperwhite model when my original, basic Kindle """"died.""""  I do like the Paperwhite (backlighting) function.  What avid reader doesn't swoon at the idea of sneaking a read in bed in the dark without struggling with a flashlight?  But I do NOT like the touchscreen for turning pages.  I am not a Luddite.  I use and appreciate technology but I just do not get the appeal.  To me, a huge part of the appeal of a Kindle is that it is small and light.  I should be able to hold it in one hand an turn the page WITHOUT LIFTING A HAND.  With the old models, you could apply gentle pressure to the page turn lever on the edge of the device and - voila! - next page.  Now it feels like a work out: lift-and-reach-and-lift-and-swipe-and.... no thank you!  I can't take it.  I find myself avoiding picking my Kindle up because the prospect is so unappealing.  I am looking for a used or refurbished model.  Amazon now offers one model with a """"pressure based turn sensor"""" but at $200 you pay for the privilege.  This Kindle has lots of other functions like vocabulary builder and a built in dictionary.  I don't use those.  I wish there were a better inventory management system, ideally one that would sync with an online index of one's books.  It's a bear to try to organize content.  If it were not for the page-turning issue, I'd give it a much higher rating.  It is a pretty neat little device otherwise."",""Regrettably, not a page turner""";;;;;;
"2.0 out of 5 stars,""One might say I should have done more research but because I also bought the paper white, I realized that the screen was very dim.

"2.0 out of 5 stars,""That's about the only pro I can give this ereader. It works. You put books on and you read them. Reading the product description I knew there was no back light for it, I knew it was small, I knew there was no apps or internet access. That's fine I have a nook and laptop and tablet for the additional things. I really did want a simple ereader. Next time, I'll get something else. The only reason I am keeping this one is because it was only $60 and I understand you get what you pay for.Pros: 1. It's lightweight. 2. It's simple. 3. The touchscreen is pretty cool. 4. And the special offers on my home screen every day keep me updated about new books and products.Cons: 1. Glare-free? That's a laugh. I can't read it in the dark because of no backlight (which I knew about) but I can't read it during the day because I can't see the screen it's nothing but glare from whatever light I'm using. 2. You can't brighten the screen. 3. I really don't like how the kindle loads up, changes pages, or loads new content. It blinks and freaks out for a few minutes like it's crashing. Then it straightens itself out. 4. It doesn't turn off. Just the screen goes off. 5. In order to get to your user manual and set up instructions, you have to set up your kindle.....what's the point?All in all I got it because it was the cheapest one and I wanted to be able to use the rest of my Christmas money to buy books. Next time, I'll spend the extra $40 and wing it....or I'll go back and get a nook instead."",Well....it works?";;;;;;

First,  I already have a big investment in Audible books, which I love. However, I was NOT TOLD that this piece of junk has no SPEAKER!!!! Thus my audible books are no good to me. Second, This device is much harder to hold than the earlier models.  If your fingers just slightly brush the left side of the screen you go to the preceding page and if you happen to touch the right side then you go forward. This is a huge step backwards from the early Kindles where you had to touch an actual, real button to move back and forth. Third, this device is far less intuitive to navigate that the early models.

It is almost constantly within my reach and usually in my hands.Sadly, the non-backlit kindle is now a touchscreen.

I don't buy the claims of how many books they hold, especially since I only have a couple hundred titles and I think that's why the second one froze on me--indigestion.

I absolutely love it. The battery lasts forever. You can hold it in one hand. In fact, it easily fits in my inside coat pockets for taking it on the go. I still read plenty of hardback books, but I must say, when I'm reading a book on this I get through it a lot faster (partially because it's so portable).

"1.0 out of 5 stars,""DO NOT CHANGE THE BATTERY ON THIS KINDLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  And buy the extended warranty if you don't want to completely waste your money.  I had an old style Kindle a number of years ago and for a long time it did fine.  When the battery pooped out, I was able to buy new ones and change them and the Kindle worked fine.  (the Kindle batteries suck BIG TIME, but that's a whole other issue).Then came this new Kindle.  I had high hopes that it would be even better than my first, but I hate it.  It is horrible.  But I did have the presence of mind to buy the two year extended warranty, and I am so glad I did, because this Kindle crapped out on me after just 1 and 1/2 years.  So I did what I thought you were supposed to do, I got on Amazon and bought a new battery and changed it.  Well, now the Kindle does not work, and when I called to see if something could be done, I was told that changing the battery was considered """"intentional damage"""" to the Kindle.  Nowhere are you warned that you should not change the battery.  Since I bought the battery through Amazon, they are going to be nice enough to replace the Kindle, which is very kind of them because I am as disgusted as I can possibly be with this Kindle version.  Now it looks like I will be getting another one, but you can bet when it no longer works I will not be trying to change the battery.

I didn't ask for it";" I asked for books... I included links... I wanted paperback books.  I later purchased two of the books I had asked for, and paid 2 cents more for both of them than I'd have paid for the Kindle version of just one.  The other book I wanted is available as an ebook from our local library.  After spending - hours?- trying to download it I finally called the library and talked to a nice woman at the reference desk.  The version our library has would download to a Nook, or a something else, or to a Kindle Fire, but NOT to a black or white Kindle.  So, after two months, my Kindle is charged, and, as far as I'm concerned, looking for its """"forever"""" home.Children everywhere, do not presume to know more than your parents about everything.  You probably know more about a lot of things, but not everything. Allow your old parents their odd little preferences, and if they want to hold a book, buy a book.We have not gone on vacation for over 20 years.  I buy most of my books at thrift shops and library book sales.  Bookfinder.com is even better than Amazon for finding used books. When I finish a book I find I really liked I often pass it on to my mom (who, at 85, also has no interest in a Kindle), or my sister (also in her 60's and quite happy looking at words on paper).I have more than once, when reading, found myself having a question about some passage I'm reading and looking back to find and re-read some previous mention that I faintly recall having something to do with that passage, and I employ fingers and bookmarks to get e to and fro quickly.  Perhaps that is possible with a Kindle, but the idea of flicking back through 50 pages or more strikes me as extremely irritating.  I guess I'm just an old-fashioned girl.So, if you like gadgets, or you travel a lot, or believe this will be of benefit to you, then I suppose you should buy one, although I'd have to say based on my extremely limited experience, you might be better off with a Kindle Fire.  But if you're just thinking you really like paper books but maybe you should try to stay up with the times,  don't waste your money."",Not For Me...";;;;;

I was reading my Kindle books on a tablet until I received the Kindle, and about a week or two after trying to adjust to the screen in dim grey tones, I gave up and went back to the tablet. As much as I would like to support Amazon and their products, I'm not sure this entry level reminder of early-80's computer monitors is for me, and judging from the reviews of other Kindles, I may just stick with the tablet. There's no reason Amazon can't afford to be on the cutting-edge with these with the number that they sell.

"2.0 out of 5 stars,""Here's the thing: I loved my Kindle.  Loved it!But before you buy you should know that Amazon will do very little to help if your Kindle dies outside of warranty, which by the way is ONLY ONE YEAR.  I don't know about you, but I take good care of things.  My Kindle lived in it's stupidly expensive case, was never dropped, never exposed to water - heck, I didn't even load it up with too many books.  But suddenly it started freezing while I was reading, and then it wouldn't turn on without being fully charged, and then it wouldn't turn on at all.So I went to the help forums, and found that others were experiencing similar problems.  Several people mentioned that the case was a problem: the paint on the little hooks used to attach the case to the Kindle wore off, exposing the metal and interfering with the Kindle itself.  When it got to this point everybody on the forum said it was time to call customer service.  So I did.What will Amazon do to make right the fact that their product was faulty, caused in part by another Amazon product?  Because it's outside that one year warranty they'll generously give me $12 off the purchase of a new Kindle.  I might as well have just waited for some dumb sale to go on.  Are you kidding me, Amazon?????Anyway, just wanted to let y'all know that you'll fall in love with your Kindle, it will die, and you'll just have to fork over even more money to Amazon to basically flat-out replace it."",""I love you, Kindle.

How difficult would it be to ask the consumer in what language written material is required and then the warranty and a proper instruction booklet in that language be provided?

The battery life became shorter, as in every other hour I had to plug the kindle onto the charger. Wasn't too bad since there are outlets where I normally sit, but then it got worse. It started powering down when it hit a certain point, normally this is good, it saves power and keeps it from totally dying, but what makes it bad is that it started powering down automatically at 30%, then 40%, then 45%. It continued on until I got absolutely fed up with it, this morning I read on it for around 2 hours when the charge hits 70%. And it powers down. These Kindles are not designed for long term use, they are designed to last until the next """"New and Improved"""" model comes out with a bigger price tag. Which will overall do the same thing.

If you are waking up in the middle of the night wide awake say at 2am or 3am (like I was) then blame it on none other than the electronic screen in your face, which you are likely using too late at night making your brain think it's daytime. If you want to read, grab a real paper book. Through great discipline, I have avoided long term contact with screens after 7:30pm.

"1.0 out of 5 stars,""Very disappointed with Amazon. I guess this is my first 1-star review, but it's well deserved. They sold this old technology Kindle with a coloured cover in a U$99.99 """"kids bundle."""" I decided to buy (two of them) because I thought it would be a real KIDS bundle that would come pre-configured with some kids configuration, maybe some pre-loaded content or, at least, an easy to follow process that would make it a KIDS device. Bear in mind that these are my 5th and 6th Kindle devices and I am above the average in terms of """"tech-savviness."""" So I can assure you that this is absolutely a regular Kindle, with no easier config to kids whatsoever. The only KIDS flavor is the coloured cover! To make things worse, 2 days after I bought them, they reduced the price of Kindle Paperwhites to a lower price than this one. I then decided to reach Amazon via chat to register my dispointment (I rarely do that, bcs I don't have time to waste, but I really felt betrayed and knew ther WERE customer centric). So there I spent 20 minutes chatting with some very polite CRs. When I was with the second one, called Apoorva, who is a Kindle specialist and who the first one, """"MJ,"""" said would be the perfect one to take some action to compensate me, she said she was having technical issues and was not able to access my account. There I realized I was in trouble and the whole thing was going nowhere... But since I was in this process for so long, I decide to get this call from them to try to finish what  had started. Wow, what a bad experience! Yes, they made it worse! A clueless guy called, who could not hear me well, nor follow anything thru, not even the simplest rational (yes, I did have to start telling the whole story again, which was already transcritpted in that chat log, bcs he could not access it, even though I had logged in to that previous chat: technology is not Amazon's forte!). Well, going nowhere except for the fact that I decided I would return the devices and waste a bit of more time to make this review.

"1.0 out of 5 stars,""To be clear: This review is not about the product, as the products we purchased for our kids remain in their original packaging until Christmas.

Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't provide a link to the correct page on the site. I had to search for the site, and couldn't determine where to go to get this warranty. I finally got someone on the phone with a clue. This gal then tells me the Amazon Customer Support people were wrong. She stepped through the entire convoluted process with me. Even so, she was confused about which warranty came with the devices and we wound up working by trial and error only to demonstrate that the warranty promo codes don't work.I'm now having to wait for new, supposedly valid promo codes so I can go through this painful process again.Amazon: This """"process"""" is well below any reasonable standard of expectation, and you ought to be ashamed of yourselves for rolling it out to your Customers!UPDATE: I received an email from the very helpful Squaretrade Customer Support person giving me exact instructions on exactly how to """"purchase"""" the correct warranty on Amazon.com. It did in fact work. Now I have to wait for emails from Squaretrade to activate the warranties. After nearly 2 hours of my time being wasted messing around with useless Amazon.com Customer Support people, my problem gets resolved by someone not employed by Amazon. Unbelievable!"",Good Luck Getting the Squaretrade Warranty Activated!";;;;;;

"3.0 out of 5 stars,""I had an old keyboard kindle that I inherited from my dad. I mostly liked it and for straight book reading it was fine.

"2.0 out of 5 stars,""So far I do like it. But I am still somewhat disappointed and of one thing. Yes! Because there is no way to lighten the screen.I snapped this up on Prime Day, and it had big and bold KINDLE PAPERWHITE HUGE SAVINGS. That was the heading. and i read about the paperwhite a few weeks before and one of the selling points was the backlight.Now on Prime Day, I get to work and I see I have a little less than 10 minutes before times runs out. Mind u there were other possibilities to buy a few times for the day. But seeing PAPERWHITE... liking what I read about it before... wanting to buy... time being a constraint... I clicked on the lower of the two prices and scanned through some details, it comes with special offers which to date I have no idea what they are, but made me even more interested, and before anyone in work could see what I was up to, I purchased.I am not one for such rash decisions... unless maybe I see a good buy, but talk about bad decision. I just personally think it was not just me, or else I would have provided a better rating, but rather it was false advertising. The solution I am now faced with is to pay more than double (because I got it at a discounted price) to buy the Kindle paperwhite. Still wrapping my head around everything."",Feeling misled";;;;;;

"1.0 out of 5 stars,""I would never ever buy another one of these.  My family has had several,  After variable amounts of time, once only 2 weeks, the screens invariably break.  This happens even if the device is in a protective case and without hitting it or any other trauma.  Amazon knows about this defect, when you call customer service they admit it is a frequent problem.  But they will not replace the screen or replace the device if it is past the warrantee date, even though they know the devices always fail without any abuse.  I think it is planned, they get to sell more readers this way, because you have no choice but to replace them.

I would much prefer getting a copy of my older Kindle without the inconvenience of a touch screen.I have tried to get help from the Amazon Kindle experts but their English is so bad they don't even understand the questios I ask them so they answer with useless information.  Amazon customer service has gone downhill.  Nice people but not helpful.,A step backwards;;;;;;

"1.0 out of 5 stars,""What a piece of crap. This is the worst thing I've ever purchased from Amazon. I am so very disappointed both with the device and with Amazon's lies.First of all, the screen is so dim that it strains my eyes within about 2 minutes. It's a low rez screen from the days of the handheld Nintendo games from the 90s. I feel like I'm looking at blurry black text on a grey screen. I suppose there's a more expensive version, but even the inexpensive version shouldn't be this bad/dim/blurry. Even though it's a sub-$100 device, it shouldn't look like this.Furthermore, Amazon's marketing of this product is exceptionally misleading. Well, that's being generous. THEY LIE. On the Kindle page they say you can listen to books - except this device has no audio output. You can download the app on your phone, but even when downloading books that are supposed to have """"audio companion"""" the option never appears on the app so there's no listening option. I tried 5 different ones that supposedly had audio. None provided the option of listening. There was never an icon that allowed me to switch from book to audio. In short, there are seemingly NO audio books you can get through their """"unlimited"""" Kindle subscription. It's a flat-out lie. Shame on you, Amazon.So I end up with a device I can't read and a subscription I can't listen to. Thus this piece of trash is currently headed back to Amazon for a refund. I suggest you stay away."",Dim Screen and Misleading Marketing = RETURNED DEVICE";;;;;;

"1.0 out of 5 stars,""I got this Kindle shortly before traveling extensively.  I wanted a reader that wasn't backlit so that it was easier on my eyes.  When I got it, I ordered it with a case that had a built in light.  Amazon stated that the items were frequently purchased together.  The case was perfect - the light was built into the case and ran off of the Kindle charge, so no additional batteries.  HUGE reason for me buying the Kindle.  Well, the case did NOT fit the Kindle that it is 'often purchased' with.  Not only was I not able to find a case with a light that could be delivered in time, I was unable to get ANY case that would fit this model in time - on Amazon or in a local store (even stores that also sell this model).  Without a protective case and a light to read by, there was no good reason to settle for this model."",The case was perfect - the light was built into the case and ...";;;;;;

3.0 out of 5 stars,I was a little disappointed by this kindle. I did not realize that you can't read the screen at night. I used to have a Kindle Fire which worked like a regular tablet. You can read day or night. With this Kindle you can read in daylight or in a well lit room. In dim light it's difficult to read. In the dark it's impossible. Half of its usage for me comes from reading at night. The first night I tried using this I was using the flashlight function on my iPhone to shine a light on the kindle. I'm thinking of returning this and getting the Paperwhight.The description did not specifically say you couldn't read in the dark but it didn't say you couldn't either. I wish Amazon would be more forthcoming in their product descriptions,If You're A Bedtime Reader Then Pass On This Kindle.;;;;;;

"3.0 out of 5 stars,""Husband bought this as a gift for Christmas! I loved it until it started getting dark outside, Oooohhh, nooooooooo, 😵😮, THERE IS NO BACKLIGHT!!!We had discussed the light and both having vision problems and decided on the backlight before ordering. He thought that's what he was ordering, the mid price model, during the Christmas sale, where they were $20 off.The lengthy description needs to be clearer regarding not including the backlight up front close to the purchase price. Unless one scrolls down to the chart it does not state NO BACKLIGHT clearly anywhere. We went to a local retailer and purchased the Paperwhite model that we wanted originally later that week.  He was disappointed at Christmas for not getting the right item for me. I tried to read with it anyhow but just could not see it. Somewhere in the description the need for the backlight to read at night even in bright home lighting needs also to be mentioned.Also, the $14.99 adaptor is a common adaptor most folks have around anyhow. Save your money. The charging cable was included.Hopefully, I won't have any hassles in returning both. Just wanted to purchase the right product in the first place. Needs to be simpler ordering the model you want with a simpler clearer description."",""NO BACKLIGHT!!! Put in big letters up front, please seller!""";;;;;;

"1.0 out of 5 stars,""I have a Kindle Keyboard 3G and love it.  The forward turn button is starting to not work all the time.  Have to push it twice so I ordered the Paperwhite and absolutly hate it. It sucks the battery big time.  If anyone tells you the battery is only used when you turn a page they're full of it.  It has a light setting that you cannot shut off.  You cannot shut the paperwhite off either.  You can put it in sleep mode but the second you touch the case or move it, ever so lightly, it comes back on.  I would not recommend this to anyone and I'm sorry I wasted my money on it.  I put it away to have when my other Kindle's button finally went so it's too late for me to send it back.  Since people seem to have such a high opinion of it on here, maybe I'll sell it to some poor schmuck who didn't know better, like me.  I even bought a very good leather case with a book stand for and can't use it now.  This whole experience has NOT been a good one for me."",I have a Kindle Keyboard 3G and love it.

It took up to a week and a half for it to arrive and instead of one Amazon Kindle 6 inch, I received six. I did the right thing by contacting customer service and was thanked for doing so. And am returning the other five. But it was then a hassle to figure out which kindle belonged to ME.

"2.0 out of 5 stars,""As usual they took a great technological idea and made it worse.  You're stuck using Wi-Fi whether or not you want to, or can.

They have taken the standard road of retail technology and have told the purchaser to take it the way we want you to take it or bugger off."",Very disappointing";;;;;;

I've had this for about 2 months, have used it and tried to learn to like it, but it isn't as easy to use or as intuitive as I am used to.

"5.0 out of 5 stars,""What a great epic work! Hard to read, but the descriptions of the era, or the battle of Waterloo etc. are just fantastic. (I could have gone without the description of the convent and the nuns though). As in other classics, those descriptions take a bigger part of the book compered to the actual plot. Overall a great book by a great author."",What a great epic work";;;;;;
"2.0 out of 5 stars,""I am not a fan of this e-reader at all and I'm surprised by all the positive reviews. It's so basic I'm not sure what the point is. For people who are used to backlit LCD screens (that would be all of us, I think), this Kindle is way too dim and there is no way to increase the brightness. In the old days when we read paper-based material all the time, this would have been fine. But now that I have a smartphone, laptop, and tablet with backlit screens, this Kindle feels old-fashioned and inconvenient--I no longer need or have extra reading lamps for my other reading. There is also some shadowing when you turn the page which doesn't happen if you use the Kindle app on a tablet.  The screen is really small too. In its favor: it's lightweight, battery life is supposed to be long (since it is not lighting up anything, that's easy to understand), and it should be glare-free in direct sunlight. So as a backup travel ereader when you go to the beach, this is ok. But I wouldn't recommend it for anything else."",Very disappointing";;;;;;

"1.0 out of 5 stars,""I am VERY disappointed in this Kindle reader. My other one couldn't hold a charge after a couple of years so I ordered this one. The old one was back lit. This is not.

"1.0 out of 5 stars,""I will not buy a Kindle again. I have the Kindle 6"""" blk. I purchased it in March and it pooped out in August. The screen imprint froze onto the screen. They sent me a new one and alas it has pooped out again. I charge it and it says it isn't charged, and it won't find my network even though I can get onto internet on computer fine. So I had to download my books via cable. I also restarted the Kindle 3 times and turned it off for the night. I also charged it for 3 hours. That was fine with me, but it won't charge, so I am screwed.I called Amazon and they had me turn off my router...which doesn't make sense since my computer gets onto internet fine. She had me turn off Kindle and now I can't get it to turn back on. They are sending me a new charger, although I don't know how that will fix the problem with it not recognizing my network. Also, my old charger worked fine 2 weeks ago.I will try the new charger but am fed up with the Kindle product.Will try Nook now.VERY DISCOURGED!"",""Only lasted me 5 months, 2 times!!!""";;;;;;
"1.0 out of 5 stars,""It arrived with no light icon on the toolbar and after a lot of haggling with Amazon reps in what sounded like the Phillipines. This was a replacement for a Kindle paperwhite that broke down after 15 months.  They tried to sell me one for $59, proclaiming this was a $40 discount.  The confirmation receipt indicated this was for a refurbished rather than a new Kindle, something not disclosed during my interaction with the reps.  The confirmation arrived simultaneously with an Amazon offer for a new Kindle for $59.  It took 1-1/2 hours of call time to finally arrange for the return of the on its way refurbished model for the new reader. When the reader arrived, it lacked the lighting icon, meaning I have no way to change the backlighting.  Poor service all around."",Shame on you Amazon outsourced customer service";;;;;;

I purchased a brand new (defective) kindle and after a month of begging was sent a refurbished kindle to replace it.,Terrible Customer Service Amazon;;;;;;
"1.0 out of 5 stars,""I have not really got to use it a lot. But since this is a Christmas present from Santa to my 7 year old, the first thing I was asked to do is to put the """"active contents"""" on, e.g. crossword games and chess games. But to my frustration, I didn't get to complete the task in 5 mintues. The research that followed told me that this version does not support """"active contents"""" which really puzzled me. Why??? Crossword and chess are really educational and good for a break from reading, I would think. I simply don't understand why this functionality is taken away. Now I ended up giving my paperwhite to my kid and I'm taking over this inferior product. Not happy at all! If it were not from Santa, I would definitely have returned it!"",Crossword and chess are really educational and good for a break from reading";;;;;;
"3.0 out of 5 stars,""I don't like it as well as my first Kindle, which was also the lowest priced one, all I need since I only read library books.  The old had a cover which was part of the device, this one requires you to buy one.  My old one opened to the home page or the page of the book I was reading, this one opens to ads which apparently I can only get off the device if I pay $15.  Don't want to pay not to use a feature so I'll hope I don't order anything by accident.  Old one had a slightly larger actual screen as I recall and an actual button at the bottom which you pushed for the home page, this one does not.  The one problem I seem to have with either is that if you accidentally skip pages, you don't know where you were and there's no way to get back except to go back one page at a time until you recognize something.  That's a rather tedious process.  Wish the pages were numbered rather listed on one side as a percent of the book read and whatever that number on the left is.  Despite my comments, I do like having a Kindle as I'm a very fast reader and this way I can actually not worry about finishing a book before I get home to get another."",Likes and Dislikes";;;;;;
"1.0 out of 5 stars,""Do NOT buy the """"Kids Kindle Bundle"""" as a gift.  It appears to be a sad """"bait and switch"""" offer.I bought the """"Kids Kindle Bundle"""" as a birthday gift for my little granddaughter.  One of the things I particularly liked about this package gift was that it included two-years insurance coverage against issues that might happen to a kid's first electronic device, and not just insurance against device defects.  BUT THERE IS A CATCH!  I AM OUTRAGED!On other Amazon electronic products, the insurance is activated as soon as the product is shipped to the buyer.  In the case of a """"Kids Kindle Bundle,"""" however,  the insurance can only be activated after the device is connected to an Amazon account.  All this must occur within a 30-da period or else Amazon does not back its deal, EVEN THOUGH THE INSURANCE COVERAGE ALREADY HAD BEEN PAID FOR IN THE KIDS KINDLE PACKAGE.Their solution?  Take the Kindle away from the child.  Mail it back for credit and start all over.  Not much of a """"Happy Birthday"""" to a little child. She loves using her Kindle and is so proud of it that we can only hope it comes to no harm.  If it does, it certainly will be replaced with a device from a different producer."",""NO GRAMMA! --Do NOT buy the """"Kids Kindle Bundle"""" as a gift!""";;;;;;

I will probably go back to my kindle one and continue to use it.This kindle 2 paperwhite changes the font size whenever it wants. turns the pages whenever it wants making me leaf back through many pages to find out where I was. It turns itself off whenever if feels like it. There are more problems with it but I just don't feel like sitting here going through them. I am going to try to read the 5 books I downloaded to it and then just throw it away. The first kindle is wonderful. I should have stayed with it. If I do get another one I sure hope it is better than the # 2 or I might just stay with #1. I am sure most of the Kindles are great but as luck would have it I did not get a good one."",Bad Kindle #2 Paperwhite";;;;;;

"2.0 out of 5 stars,""I bought a kindle a few years ago. I had cause to complain about the web browser. Whenever I downloaded my local newspaper and press article mode it keeps downloading over and over. Recently, when the menu button is depressed, it will take a frustratingly long time to appear. reading books on it was almost perfect.. Believing the machine was defective I bought a new improved model which promised touch screen facility, improved dynamics, and most of all an IMPROVED WEB BROWSER. Boy, was I disappointed! This machine is far worse than the old one when it comes to web browsing  Imagine, the bookmarks that were downloaded with it from the Manufacturers simply don't work.It keeps blinking and downloading over and over. options in the menu button takes quite a while to appear many times. However, once again the reading books is quite a pleasure. When it comes to reading a book or a down loaded article it works quite well. I bought this machine so that I can down load my local news papers to read. I am aware of charges to be incurred for certain sights, my comparison lies with my computer and tablet where I get most of the important news. some companies give a synopsis of certain articles and you are asked to sign in to read more. In case of the E reader,  I am regularly getting the message Application Error, Try Again. If I try again the same message comes up. These pages will download perfectly in any of my computers or tablet."",""KINDLE 6"""" TOUCH SCREEN""";;;;;;

"1.0 out of 5 stars,""I was so excited about receiving my Kindle, I love to read.  Friends of mine have older models and they love it.  BUT I feel you should better inform the customer that if they do not have wireless service it cannot be used.  I called for help and was told I can purchase books to my computer and download them to my Kindle.  Was sent instructions and watched your video.  Would not work.......Totally frustrating.  The price was great at 59.00 until I got wireless installed just to use the Kindle it was not worth it, not including the adaptor I bought just to charge it.  I would have paid a higher price to get a Kindle that came with the wireless already installed like my friends have.  Totally disappointed."",I love to read";;;;;;

3.0 out of 5 stars,Very disappointed that there is no audio facility.  My last Kindle was used mainly to listen to books as I drove.  I spend 50% of each work day in my truck and had the last Kindle connected to the speaker system.  I received this new Kindle as a gift and although the functionality of reading of books is better I am disappointed that the oral listening function was eliminate.  I now will try my smart phone as an audio reading device but I will not use Kindle on it.  This is my way of letting Amazon know of how disappointed I am in the decision to remove the audio function.,No audio listening function;;;;;;
"1.0 out of 5 stars,""This is a complete SCAM. The fact you have to pay $20 to have ads removed is absurd. Also with so many of the same books for purchase on the site, why is it you can find those same books for free on the internet?

1.0 out of 5 stars,The worst thing is that it didn't have a light & I had to use a lamp to read in bed. I also had trouble downloading a book from my local library.

2.0 out of 5 stars,There is no brightness adjustment on this model. If you need or want this option you are out of luck. i have an older version of the basic Kindle and it was on that one.

"1.0 out of 5 stars,""This Kindle is the most infuriating thing I've ever owned -- and it is my 3rd Kindle!  I loved the first 2 Kindles.  This machine is the devil incarnate!  First there is the touch screen which is strange enough to learn, but okay, I can manage it.  Then there are the constant ads -- BEWARE!  Even after I paid the additional $20 dollars to take the ads away, I STILL HAVE ADS CONSTANTLY and suggestions that take up half my screen.  So basically I paid $80 bucks for ADS ALL DAY ALL NIGHT NEVER ENDING ADS!  I am ready to toss it or return it, but then how do I read my books? AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL -- if I could put fewer stars, I would!UPDATE -- I am not changing this review.  I have changed my kindle so that it has fewer ads on it, but there are still ads.  I have been through hours of tutorials  and online discussion groups -- I needed this?  And the upshot is I want to read my books, so I am living with the ads.  Yes, I found the place where you can turn the ads off, but only some ads.  There are still recommendations and the off screen is not James Joyce or Emily Dickinson -- no, it's a Dyson ad for a vacuum!"",Unbelievably AWFUL AD Machine -- I paid money for this??????";;;;;;

"3.0 out of 5 stars,""The Kindle is everything Amazon says it is.  I have an older one, the one with the keys and no light.  It's getting on, nearly five years old now, and I'm starting to experience reduced usage time because the batteries are slowly dying and there is no way to replace them.I have over a hundred titles on my Kindle, and it is a pleasure to use.  I like the ability to look things up and make notes....So why only three stars?Last week, the last bookstore in town closed for lack of business.  People weren't interested enough in paper books to keep it open.  Paper books, anachronisms of the first degree: no batteries, no massive storage, no handy portability for more than two or three titles.And no need for anything but a pair of eyes to read them.That's why my faithful Kindle only gets three stars.  It let me be lazy and cheap and move away from books and into electronic storage and a screen...that once the batteries are down, is unreadable.Yes, it's okay.  What it encouraged me to do...  wasn't.  Yes, buy one: you might as well. Real books are going the way of dinosaurs.Just pray nothing damages our electronic data storage or we're literally up the creek and we won't know how to make a paddle."",""Kindle, Wonderful and Terrible at the same time.""";;;;;;

"1.0 out of 5 stars,""we purchased 2 of these for our children who love to read and we can't keep enough books in the house for them. Unfortunately the low low price This review of 1 star reflects the quality of the product. One unit came infected with malware right out of the box purchased as new thru Amazon Prime and was unusable. The second was difficult to set up browsing at our local library but once I found a round about way I was able to check out books. I discovered that even though a library book is checked out Kindle still requires you to set up an account (including personal information) in order to read a book that is not associated with Amazon. The book belongs to the county library not Amazon. This reader was purchased for a child who does not have an Amazon account and does not need one. The screen was difficult to read and the refresh rate was horrible. Any slight touch on the screen cased it to blink, flash and break up. I would not suggest purchasing this product even if you are tech wavy, it's just not worth the effort. We are a big Amazon family and purchase products regular from them and plan to continue. I am just very disappointed and a bit shocked they would support a product as poor as this."",very dissappointed in product";;;;;;

Beyond the fact that you can't use it at night, even during the day the screen seems unusally dark at times and in places, and is not easay to read. Perhaps I'm missing something as to how to manipulate the visitbility of the screen, but if not, this is a drawback in my view."",It's very light and easy to read using one hand";;;;;;

"1.0 out of 5 stars,""First the battery needs to be constantly recharged if you are using the backlight, which is most of the time.  The unit does mini-freezes constantly when trying to play simple games.  When reading you have to consciously avoid toughing any part of the screen or you will either turn a page back, forward, or most usually find yourself in a """"menu"""" that you have to spend time getting the heck out of.If you have large fingers, trying to point to a single word for a definition invariably results in your highlighting a whole section of works, so you have to lose more time exiting that area.While touchscreens may be OK for cell phones, they are a complete disaster for e readers.  Games such as Every Word become impossible to use as one advances to new levels.  The letters become so long a line at the bottom that you often trigger hitting the margin, thus moving to yet another menu you don't want.  One would think Amazon would have tested this inane system of book reading and game playing before sticking this junk on the world.I sorely miss my old reader that had the tabs on the side for advancing each page, that pre-loaded words into Every Word, that made editing, etc. simple.  Now it is a complete, utter disaster.  Shame on Amazon."",Worse Product in their Line";;;;;;

"1.0 out of 5 stars,""I used to LOVE my Kindle until I realized that Amazon does not really care about quality of user experience.It is very difficult to send feedback, so if there is a problem with the way the system works, a specific feature, etc. there is little recourse, and it seems that Amazon intentionally makes it hard to find. There are lots of problems with the system. Read below for some examples...The touch screen (and lack of keyboard which makes typing slow and tedious) is horrible and imprecise and I detest it. I have sent Amazon feedback and requested that they continue making the Kindle Keyboad, but they have phased out all non-touch models anyway. For many people a touch screen is just not a viable option, and for me it is highly annoying--like when I lean over and strand of my hair brushes the page and skips two chapters ahead completely losing my place in the book (WTF!) making it extremely time consuming to get back to the page I was on without accidentally reading ahead and spoiling it. It is especially horrible when that happens in books that have very long chapters, or have sections and chapters and have been improperly formatted by the Kindle system. If dust gets on your screen, or a hair, or something that can't be blown off with a breath, you will have to actually turn the Kindle off to remove it, or risk hopelessly losing your current page.The Kindle App for Android is pretty bad, too. Definitions are rarely displayed properly, and when they are it is only the first few words, so you have to click and wait for it to load the full definition if you actually want to see word origin or anything useful. Also, the pop-up could be decent if you could then highlight a word within it and it would show the definition of that, BUT there is actually no way at all to look up a word when viewing the definition of another word because things cannot be highlighted to view definitions from the page it takes you to! It is INFURIATING, and the only way that I can see to send feedback is to go through Amazon.com and email or call from there.There are so many negatives, and outright glitches that just don't get fixed, but there is also a HUGE deficit of useful features that could be easily integrated into the system. Connection with Google Drive for example would be an excellent way to organize highlights and notes (which are almost useless in the form that the Kindle stores and displays them).Recently my Kindle has been telling me that I can't open more than half of the books that I have purchased from the Kindle... because """"they are registered to a different user"""" and I am not looking forward to, and don't have time to figure out why that's happening.I have been more and more disappointed with Kindle over time, but I hope they read this review and actually start trying to get on track again. If they don't read this review, then I hope Google reads it and picks up the torch!"",Here's to hoping they actually read this";;;;;;

"2.0 out of 5 stars,""I had high expectations, and I realize that for fifty bucks I shouldn't have. The screen is not white like in the picture, more like grey. When you turn the page there's no fancy animation, just a black flash of the screen and then you're on the next page. Doesn't work with all books. I bought it for college, and my hope was to read my Java textbook with it because the physical book is HUGE... Couldn't read it because it wasn't compatible. I figure that's because of the pictures in the book. Does not display any color, and you can't read at all in the dark. Battery life is amazing, I'll give it that. Left it on for weeks and it was still running. If you want to just read basic books with no pictures in them, and aren't expecting actual tablet quality, this works just fine. If you want to read something with pictures in it... it may not be compatible. Don't buy with high expectations. It's pretty slow and blinks at you when you try to do anything with it. But, you can read books with it. Just didn't fit my purpose. Luckily it's only fifty bucks so I'm not super mad."",Didn't fit my purpose.";;;;;;

I can understand this being a budget model and using a lower resolution screen but I can't fathom why removing the back light would be an acceptable decision for an e-reader.Again, it's my own fault for not reading more carefully (I didn't have to make such a distinction when I bought mine), but I would NOT recommend this kindle model to others."",Read Carefully before Purchasing";;;;;;

Finally I just asked her to send me the return labels which apparently she didn't know how to do. I had to call back and spoke with someone knowledgeable. I am still waiting for the return label.

The Kindle I bought for has turned out to be profoundly disappointing.The so-called """"glare-free"""" screen is all but invisible except in the brightest and most direct light.  Brightness cannot be adjusted, and it is not even remotely readable at any angle other than head-on.  Do not expect to use this device on airplanes, in bed at at night, or sitting in your favorite chair in a dimly lit corner.  You will go blind if you try.Then, there is the software, which (strangely) is inferior to the apps Kindle provides for other devices.  Do not expect this Kindlle to be as responsive or as precise as the Kindle apps on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac.  It will be anything but.The bottom line is this: I returned the Seventh Generation Kindle and bought the Paperwhite instead.  At least I can read the Paperwhtie.  Other than that, there is little difference."",because my tech-saavy son recommended it.";;;;;;

It wants to reboot almost every time it's turned on and occasionally it will reboot in the middle of being used.  Sometimes, it magically turns itself on without being asked to, which, of course, runs the battery down so that the next time I pick it up, there's no juice.  Amazon help has given me instructions on how to reboot using the charger, but that doesn't always work.  Even if it did, who wants an e-reader for which one has to carry the charger at all times.  A friend of mine has a Fire that refused to take a charge a few days after the 1-year warranty expired.  She bought an I-Pad.  I'm buying the cheapest version Kindle available only because I've already paid for a large number of books that I haven't yet read and some others that I've read but want to keep for reference.

"2.0 out of 5 stars,""As a tablet the kindle is absolute trash. It tries to be more than an e reader which is not what I was looking for at all. If you are thinking about buying a tablet just go all out and spend a little more money for a better tablet. The operating system is very slow, especally the keyboard which makes browseing the internet or writing anything a complete drag. The layoutalso makes it very difficult to use especially with the worthless autocorrect. You can also not change the home screen or lock screen photos which makes me feel as if amazon™ has loned it to me. All data on this device is also collected by amazon™.I just wanted a functional e reader, insted I have a semi functional tablet. Do not buy this."",""Absolute trash.
