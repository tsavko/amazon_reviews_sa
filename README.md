## Project description
The aim of the current project is to predict the rating user is likely to give to a given product on Amazon (in our case, Kindle), based solely on the title and the review text, using Python.

Currently, binary classification is used instead of 5 star ratings, with reviews containing 3+ stars treated as positive. Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier is used in order to allow for increased number of classes in the future.

## What's next
*Various classifiers are going to be tested on the given dataset
*Multi-class classification (5 classes - one for each star rating) will be implemented
