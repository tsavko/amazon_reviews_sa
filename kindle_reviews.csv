5.0,as has been the case for years amazon sloooowwwwly adds new changes and features to the kindle this one is no exception if youve used a kindle in the past youre not going to notice much of a change with this one but since there are some minor upgrades and so forth ill briefly go over them screen the new kindle is touchscreen and has the typical matte finish with the slightly grayoffwhite paper looking background its certainly not bright white but its also not lcd looking dark gray it does not have buttons for pageturning as the older generations do if you simply must have the pageturning buttons please search for the older kindles that offer that one last thing regarding the screen this is not a kindle paperwhite or voyage where you have a backlit screen this has an unlit offwhite kindle screen i will say the text is noticeably crisper and bolder than ive seen with previous generation kindles and i believe thats because amazon is using einks new carta displays instead of the previously used pearl displays i love that and have been waiting for years for eink the taiwan based company that makes the kindle screens for amazon to improve them it looks like theyre finally getting itthe new kindles screen resolution is 167 ppi which is slightly lower than the kindle paperwhite which is 212 ppi and substantially lower than the kindle voyage which boasts an impressive 300 ppi individual pixels at this density can not be distinguished by the naked eye pricewise though the base model paperwhite runs 99 at the time of this review and the voyage base model runs 199 so you can see the more you pay the better the resolution and features 167 ppi is fine though in fact most webpages are 72 dpi to give you a comparison special offers or not like other kindles you have the choice of purchasing one with special offers which is simply a marketing tactic amazon uses which although some people may find annoying i actually like as it recommends books that im actually interested in versus random crap id never buy onboard storage and processor speed one upgrade the new kindle has is the amount of onboard storage which now allows you to hold thousands of books and of course it also comes with a slightly faster processor which amazon claims is 20 faster although honestly i dont notice the increase in speed pages turn quickly and thats all that really matters to me speedwide the onboard storage is 4gb although you also have unlimited access to the amazon cloud so there really shouldnt be any worries about storage battery life even going back a few years the kindle paper white bragged about a battery that lasted a week versus a day for very casual reading that was true with the paper white although with regular daily use it was more like 4 days or so not a week the new kindle has a similar claim in that the battery lasts weeks not days that appears to be true you can easily go two weeks with casual reading and most of that is attributed to the fact that there is no onboard light draining the battery wifi capability not 3gbooks are downloaded quickly through wifi usually in less than 30 seconds and definitely under a minute unless you have really crappy internet service this is not 3g so you cannot download books unless you have access to wifi i have never found this a problem as i download my books at home in advance of leaving for a trip or something besides nearly every mcdonalds starbucks and hundreds of other retailers and restaurants now offer free wifi so if you simply must download that book while travelling go park in a mcdonalds parking lot and download the book its not worth paying the extra money for the 3g access especially when it oftentimes raises the product price by 50 or more dictionary and highlighting features like all new kindles the touchscreen has some major advantages one being that you can click on a word you dont know and pull up the dictionary to learn what it means also you have the option of turning on the highlight feature where you can highlight important text and see what areas of text others have highlighted the most for someone reading a book for research purposes writing a paper review etc this is a nice feature as the parts of the book people find most helpful are usually highlighted alerting you to its importance amazon prime benefits as is the case with all kindles subscribing to the amazon prime service is going to give you a lot of bang for your buck as you can borrow thousands of books for free and also get special pricing on some items access to your books books are stored in the cloud and are accessible by any kindle device registered to you as well as from your home computer which gives you plenty of options for reading some people use a kindle paperwhite or voyage in bed because of the backlight as i do and then have another kindle that they use for daytime reading very rarely do i use my home computer to read the books but it is a nice feature to have for some people if this review has helped you in any way please let me know you can also post comments or ask questions in the comments section below i try my hardest to include all the important information about the product to help you make an informed purchasing decision and feel comfortable with your purchase thank you for taking the time to read my review ,detailed review of the kindle
5.0,ive had this kindle for a while now many of the reviews say it all so i dont think i could add much but i feel like i need to speak on behalf of this kindle to shield it from reviewers and owners who seem to have no idea what they bought if this could help clear up any confusion for a first time buyer then writing this is worth it so i have to begin by asking reviewers that confuse us alldo you have any clue what you bought lets all say it out loud this kindle does not have a light it is an entry level model with no light amazon has always sold non lighted kindles and i still have many of them they are a cheap way to get into the ereader scene can you read a real book in the dark of course not so these non lighted kindles are not epic failures for not having a light just as the last novel you bought was not an epic failure for not having a built in light it is ridiculous to buy this kindle then give it a 1 star review because it doesnt have a light read the product descriptions this kindle has no light the paperwhite and voyage doscream all to the heavens this kindle does not have page turning buttons to buy this kindle then give it a 1 star review because your old kindle had page turning buttons and this one does not is insane could you not see when you clicked on buy that this kindle had no page turning buttons sometimes i think there are two kinds of kindle owners those who want page turning buttons and those who dont mind moving their thumb a nano meter to turn a page if you can tell by my sarcasm i belong to the latter bunchthen of course there are the technically deficient that have no clue what wifi is are unable to sign on and blame it on the kindle bam another 1 star review well i feel for you on this one if you are new to the scene all kindles come wifi ready ready to sign on to your wifi set up at home when this is done you can buy book from your kindle or computer all of your purchases are held in that magical storage space called the cloud and you can access those from any kindle registered under your namenow for my two cents this is a great kindle the software is the latest similar to the paperwhite its quick has any feature you could ask for from an entry level kindle i dont understand the hate for touch screen you should embrace it see that word on the page you dont know touch it with your finger and a dictionary pops up giving you the definition how many clicks on the kindle keyboard would this same function take still have my keyboard and love it but probably like one loves an antique typewriter as far as page turns go see my nano meter thumb comment above once you get used to it its a piece of cake hey the first time i picked up an iphone to type a text message how are you it came out lskdlj eiieoi c you need to acclimate yourself to a touch screen once you do those page turning buttons will start to feel like cheap little bits of plastic that will eventually stop workingunder a lamp or in natural daylight the text is bold and easy to see some fonts are bolder than others this is also a very light kindle ive found kind of a sweet spot for holding kindles pinching the bezel to hold it is awkward i place the bottom left corner in the middle of my palm rest the back of it on my four fingers and tilt it slightly to the left so it doesnt fall in my lap my thumb is perfectly free to move that nano meter to turn a pageso lets sum upthis kindle does not have a lightthis kindle does not have page turning buttonsthis kindle like all kindles has wifi capability when you are home on your wifi you can buy and download books from the kindle store if you go to the beach you cannot if you want this then get 3g this is like a cell phone personally ive never needed to buy a book outside of my home so never felt the need for 3gif this helps one person it was worth typing,know what you are buying
4.0,i am writing this from the perspective of being a longtime experienced kindle user vs someone brand new from an overall perspective considering the pricing of the kindle with special offers at 79 vs higher amounts for the different flavors of kindle available today this one is a bargain if you have wanted to get your kids a kindle to encourage reading as well as sharing of books but hesitated because 119 to 400 is a lot of money to risk with a child maybe at 79 this is your price pointfrom a size standpoint the reading screen is the exact same size as the other eink kindles it is slightly thicker but slightly lighter than the kindle paperwhite but to me its not really a noticeable difference when youre holding it in a protective coveropening up the box included with the kindle is a microusb cord but no power adapter thats really annoying interestingly and it seems rather chicken of amazon a power adaptor has to be purchased separately for 15 if you purchase it at the same time as you purchase the kindle or 20 if you purchase it later so if you already have a microusb charger handy i wouldnt order one of the chargersthere are no page buttons no buttons at all except for the power button and turning the page is as easy as tapping the side of the screen with your thumb while youre reading or swiping the screen with your fingerreading is easy on this one in comparison to my kindle keyboard the previous version of kindle and a kindle dx the letters on the screen are much much darker and easier to read the display is crisp and dark looking at the display sidebyside in the same location of an ebook against the versions of kindle mentioned above the text on this kindle is much darker and reads a lot better compared to a paperwhite it is not as dark but those results are to be expected since the paperwhite has 25 more pixels per inch but at this price point thats not too big of a concern for me as each new version of the kindle gets better and better with the fonts and screen display and this one is pretty darn good you want to be able to read what youre supposed to rightif you like the texttospeech feature of previous kindle models or listened to music with your previous kindle please be aware there are no speakers nor is there a plug for headphonesweb surfing speed with the wireless is about the same as with other versions of the eink kindles slow as christmas my usual test of the connectivity on a kindle was hitting the main pages of the mobile websites of fox news cnn and google i pushed go or enter buttons icons at the same time on each and did not see a visible difference in the load speeds start to finish i was about 50 yards away from my wireless router at home with a couple of walls in the way for the wireless test with similar results at my office after the kindle arrived i did try to check one of my google email accounts but it crashed i learned a couple of years ago to not try and surf the internet with an eink kindle because its so darn slow besides i use the kindle to read a book and i can surf the internet or check my email on my other devicesin comparison the previous version of kindle this one is replacing other than the crisper text fonts from the improved screen display as far as i can tell this new version of kindle has the same technical specifications of the previous kindle about the same size same internal memory if you had a precious version of the kindle this version is replacing that means you can use the same cover as the previous versionbattery life is supposed to last weeks on a single charge but i doubt it i charged it up 100 late yesterday afternoon and 24 hours later the battery meter is indicating about 50 left this was with the wifi left on but the kindle not being used overnight as i left it in the office in sleep mode time will tell if this is going to be a problem or notit did take a few minutes to get this model up and running as in addition to the normal making sure it is registered and going through a mandatory tutorial on which areas of the screen to tap to perform various functions there is a lot of amazon marketing you have to weed through do you want to sign up for goodreads an amazon affiliate would you like to sign up for kindle unlimited for a monthly recurring revenue stream to amazon would you like to link your facebook and twitter accounts so yourre friends family perfect strangers can be voyeuristic on what you are reading absolutely not for meyou can also sign up for parental controls with this version which i think is a great idea sometimes you dont want your children to read what you are readingone annoying thing to me at least is the automatic import of the various categories collections you have linked to your amazon account onto this version and links to the books in the cloud that you can immediately download in the same category on the new kindle if youre replacing an older kindle with this one that could be handy but if you have other people on your account family in households with more than one kindle that can be a pain in the neck because for example my wife and i generally have different tastes in books i dont want her books cluttering up my kindles screen and she feels the same way about mine its not a deal killer but it does make you wade through a lot of stuffdespite some of my nits above as a parent whose children can be hard on electronics i likethis version and think with this 79 price point it will help to continue to explode the ebook revolution even faster as they get in more peoples hands if you have not purchased a kindle before due to price need a cheaper replacement than the other versions or maybe a relative or a friend has hesitated to get one this one is in your price zone i would recommend this one,good value at 79 with a few nits
1.0,this does not have a light i am returning it this is the 3rd kindle i have had the first one just broke the 2nd one was working great then suddenly it would not let me page back and i had to restart it at least once a day so i bought this one and it doesnt have a light i guess its my fault for not reading information closer i would give up on this technology except i am addicted to cheaper books lighting and light weight books anyway this goes back tomorrow and ill order an upgrade sighhhhhhhhh,the 2nd one was working great then suddenly it would not let me page back 
5.0,i got this kindle during a black friday sale at best buy last year they had this kindle and one of the kindle fires discounted and i was torn between which one to buy i finally went with this one because i dont really need another device on which essentially to watch netflix while i am an avid reader this was my first ereader purchase id read entire books on my laptop and smart phone before so im not one of those ill only ever read a real book because thats how its meant to be people i think ereaders are great id just never made it a point to buy one with all the unread books i already have lying around the house that being said i love my kindle now since november ive probably read close to twenty books its just so easy using this particular kindle also has the added benefit that its just an ereader not a tablet ie a trove of distractions i am delighted by the fact that i can just take trip with my little device and have more books than i need it really makes me feel like i am living in the future i find it amazing every time that its a saturday night and i find out about something i need to read immediately i can just get on the kindle store and buy a new book without ever having to leave my house i also love the size it fits in any of my handbags or coat pockets i think its intuitive and easy to use i love that its glarefree because i tend to spend a lot of time outside and i can see the text no matter how bright the sun is shining the battery life is great since owning it ive probably charged it three times i would highly recommend the cover amazon has for this model its really handy im attaching a picture to show what a lovely addition kindle with the cover makes to an already wonderful day im definitely glad i bought this over a tablet its perfect for me,a book lovers delight
1.0,can you download and play games with this kindle,one star
5.0,i had a second gen kindle previously and upgraded to the touch with special offers offers arent intrusive just when i turn the kindle off im willing to accept that for a lower price plus it exposes me to new material i may be interested in size is perfect i can carry it in the front pocket of my suit coat while commuting on the train or through the airport also you can now use the kindle at any point in your flight and no longer have to turn it off for taxi and landing i thought i would miss my physical buttons but the device is small enough to operate single handedly and tapping the screenonly minor issue front screen once again shows more books i may be interested in purchasing and only leaves a single row for items ive already purchasededit thanks to the helpful comment my minor issue is resolvedgo to settings then device options then personalize your kindle then recommendations and offers and turn cover view recommendations off,1010 would purchase again
2.0,not happy the old 5button kidle was better the screen is too sensitive at times and not sensitive enough at other times when you shut off and return the book youre reading isnt moved to the top of the list you have t remember the title to reopen the booki had to try five times to remove a book from the device in general i dont like the new kindle,not happy
5.0,im loving my new kindle i previously had the kindle keyboard and sold it because i have an ipad and thought i didnt need it i caught this handy ereader on sale at staples for 49 i couldnt resist im a gadget lover its very small and light weight its more fun to read on my ereader than my ipad air i love this little thing i like the touchscreen and all the features that come with it if you are looking for something small and lightweight to read on this is the perfect device i know the kindle paperweight and the kindle voyage have better resolutions but for what im using it for i dont need to spend all that money for an ereader its perfect i dont have any complaints its easy to highlight passages and make notes with the touchscreen i also like that i can send my pdfs to my kindle get one you wont regret it,love my new kindle
4.0,pros antiglare booklike screenshould have been a bit brighter thougheyefriendlyquick reach to dictionaries and translationswordwise is a good featureeasy reach to wikihavent used xray so cant comment on thatlight weight easy to use handycons almost none if you look at it as an ereadera small brightness setting would have helped d,overall good replacementan upgrade i would say for a physical book
1.0,no one could explain to me how to work it the instructions do not help i had one question not even customer service could answer and instruct me in its use how do i get the book i bought loaded onto the kindle just to tell me to use wifi does not help how do i use wifianyway i sent it backja,no help
1.0,this is my third kindle and the first that i dislike i want a simple reader to read books and nothing more that is why i get the basic one this version has added features that have nothing to do with reading and in return adds another layer of bells and whistles that takes away from that basic function reading the interface is not as intuitive as previous versions when i go to pick it up i have to get past my annoyance with it and when i do begin to become lost in the book i am brought back to that annoyance by brushing the screen and having all kinds of pop up that i have no desire to use i dont need to resize the print so often that it needs to be a one touch operation i dont want to share what i am reading with anyone i was always impressed with the dictionary feature but now i often get no definition and instead get an attempt to connect to wikipedia i understand there are those who like all the shiny bells and whistles and it is great that they offer advanced models for them but as a basic reader this version is a step back in what should be its basic function readingit has me considering the fact that if i forced to take what ever trinkets they come up with to read the books i own then do i really own them, is my third kindle and the first that i dislike i want a simple reader to read books 
5.0,after enjoying my kindle 5th generation for a few years i decided to upgrade to the new 7th generation basic kindle i needed a device with more memory and at only 79 with special offers and 99 without it seemed to be a decent reader at an affordable pricei went on quest to search for one locally staples was a nogo they only had the previous gen models and a wellworn display fortunately best buy was right next door best buy also had a beatup display but alas there was a lonely 7th gen basic with no tagging or price if i hadnt recognized it from pictures i had seen i would have probably missed itnote to amazon you really need to improve your merchandising best buy now has a apple store samsung store windows store and sony store how about a kindle storeanyway i finally got it home and opened up the typically minimalist kindle box inside there was only the kindle a basic instruction card and a usb cable no power adapter that will cost you an extra 1520 for the amazon versionfortunately i still have the charger from my old 3rd gen kindle keyboard model reportedly you can also charge the device in about 4 hours from your computers usb jackcompared to my 5th gen the new basic kindle seems to be less sleek and more boxy the beveled back breaks up the otherwise bland and utilitarian design and makes the device easy to hold it is slightly thicker than the old version and a tad wider and longer as well it offers a wider bezel and a bigger chin the design is reminiscent of the first generation kindle fire which leads me to believe that quanta may be behind this build there are no buttons other than the power button at its usual location next to the usb port at the bottomthats right no buttons this is the first basic kindle to offer touch control it uses an infrared rather than capacitive 6 touch screen featuring pearl epaper technology with 167 ppi resolution it is capable of 16 levels of gray and is not backlit the contrast seems to be similar to that of my 5th gen and text is dark and easy to read photos can look a bit washed out howevernew features includegoodreads and social media integrationenhanced xray feature that allows you to see the structure of fictional worksintegrated vocabulary builder with flash cardskindle freetime to encourage young people to increase their readingfeatures coming soon includefamily library to allow you to link to your spouses accountword wise to allow you to read selected challenging books more easilyenhanced search capabilities incorporating info from goodreads and the amazon siteabout the book for more detailed author and book infothe new 7th generation kindle basic comes with 4gb of memorytwice as much as my 5th genand enough to store thousands of averagesized books in addition as with all other kindle devices and software you also receive free cloud storage for your books and documentsusing the new 7th gen is pretty easy the only snag is that when you hit the power button nothing seems to happen however if you look closely you will see a message at the bottom of the screen to swipe to unlock your kindlealso the infrared touch screen works much better than i expected it is very responsive and flawless in operation you just tap on the right to advance a page on the left to go back a page and on the top of the screen to view the menu and other information i found it almost as enjoyable to use as a capacitive screen despite its lack of multitouch capabilitiesin addition the device allows you to view the covers of the books or just the text of the titles as with previous kindles there is an experimental web browser that is poky and awkward to use but it may come in handy in a pinch i guess that is why it is still experimentalall in all the 7th gen basic kindle is a solid performer with long battery life weeks not days in many cases great readability and ease of use small footprint and light weight if you are looking for a nonbacklit ereader that can hold a library full of books it is a great choicecomplete review at httptonythomastechtrendsblogspotcom201410kindle7thgenerationbasicreview2014html,great device for the price
3.0,is my device faulty or it is normal for kindle to hang and get a messed up screen until you restartsee the attached photo,device hangs
5.0,there are nearly 2000 reviews already written on this device we wouldnt have bothered to add our comments except that some of the reviews that come up first because they are suppose to be the most helpful have what seems to be inaccurate information we have had a kindle keyboard for years now and we subscribe to both prime and kindle unlimited we still love the keyboard which for those who are unfamiliar is actually a third generation kindle which was originally released at the end of july in 2010 even after four years the keyboard is still quite useful and the battery is still strong in addition to being a normal ereader it also has audio output it can read books to you and play mp3 files it is a quality device and if taken care of it will last a long time our experience with it is the primary reason we trust products with the amazon name to be quality itemswe actually love our newest little kindle which is actually a seventh generation we werent planning on buying one because our keyboard is still going strong but there was a promotion where it was 20 off and it came with a 6 month extension to our kindle unlimited subscription which was 30 off so our plan was to not open it and then sell it on ebay and keep the 6 month extension to our kindle unlimited subscription but curiosity got the best of us so a few hours after it arrived we opened the box and took it for a spin and a sidebyside comparison with our beloved keyboardso first what did we find inaccurate in the other reviews the screen it does give a very good first impression amazon and nearly every reviewer claim that it is whiter brighter and has better contrast than previous generations of kindles we have always been happy with the screen on our kindle keyboard and were not sure why it needed any improvements when we put our kindle keyboard next to the new kindle under the same light to us the screens look nearly identical the only real difference we noticed is that the font on the new one seems more refined and is better to look at not only that there are several fonts to choose from side by side there is no question that a book on the screen of this latest generation kindle looks better than a book on the keyboard because of the new fonts but to us the screen itself doesnt appear any lighter whiter brighter or have higher contrast we have tablets with high resolution screens with incredible color contrast and brightness but we have always appreciated our older kindle because its screen is as close to a paper book that we have found so we are more than a little relieved that the improvements to the screen are pretty much all hype the screen does refresh quicker than our 4 year old keyboard to the point where it is hardly noticeable when changing pages but to us it is the new fonts that make the experience betterthe next thing we noticed is that even though we are used to clicking buttons to navigate on the keyboard the touchscreen really is much faster and less frustrating i cant tell you how many times we have been clicking the down arrow repeatedly to get to a menu item on the kindle keyboard and then accidentally have touched the back button which is right below it and literally had to start all over even after all of these years it still happens fairly frequentlythen there is the home button and page turning buttons that some people seem to think that they cannot live without we dont get it on the keyboard we do like the dedicated buttons without them navigating would be a bear but with the touch screen they really are not necessary for example to get to your home screen you tap at the top of the touch screen then you touch the home icon in the top left corner and you are there to change pages you can either swipe forward or back or just touch the edge of the screen personally we prefer to use one of those little rubber tipped tablet pointers so we wont get finger prints on the screen but as long as you havent been eating some kind of greasy food it is not much of an issuewe also like the newer software combined with the touch screen and faster processor everything feels smoother and more intuitive as compared to the keyboard we have to admit that we use our expensive tablets a lot with the kindle reading app especially with books that have color pictures so we are used to navigating with touch screen devices with powerful processors but there is something about the kindle ereader experience that we still appreciate with our older kindle with this newer kindle you still get the dedicated ereader experience without having to give up the more intuitive nature of a touch screenthe only other thing that we wanted to mention was the special offers our older kindle did not have that and we like all the interesting literary screen savers that come up on it and will miss them on the new one but the special offers occasionally have some interesting ads yesterday an ad for some reading glasses with three levels of magnification came up and we found them quite interesting and reasonably priced we will miss the old screen savers but the special offers dont really seem to be a problem at all if they become irritating to us it costs only 20 to unsubscribemy wife and i both have expensive tablets with beautiful screens and fast processors they are incredibly useful to us and have dozens of apps that do just about everything from video conferencing to playing games these tablets also have a lot of personal account information and other valuable data stored on them they are also quite attract to thieves if we lost one of them it would be much more than a minor inconvenience it is nice that as of now this latest little kindle contains nothing that isnt saved to the cloud it has little if any personal information if it were lost all we would have to do would be to log onto amazon and deregister it from our list of devices we would probably also change my amazon password just to be safe but my point is it is nice to have a small dedicated electronic device that is incredibly useful but wouldnt be devastating if something happened to itwe like the way that the amazon ereaders have continued to evolve this seventh generation kindle is lighter faster has a touch screen better looking fonts and has refined software it is a pleasure to use we werent planning on getting another tablet like device but this little guy is a winner we are keeping it,kindle 6 glarefree touchscreen vs kindle keyboard clearing up some innacuracies
4.0,ive been the proud owner of the original kindle fire for about three years as a tablet its great but i really love to read and my issue with the fire was bugged out eyes even using minimal lighting so for some time i pored over the kindle ereader reviews and when amazon sent me a special offer on the new 79 kindle i took the plungebottom line i love iti love the screen which doesnt even look like a screen but more like newspaper i actually gave it a little tap when i took it out of its box to see if it was a screen or a sticker also i read a lot of old books which are sometimes full of now forgotten english words and french phrases and with the vocabulary builder feature i can look up translate from several languages into english highlight store new words in flashcards etc i can also send a quote to my goodreads feed which is pretty neat and i can read for hours and my eyes are happy no theres no lighted screen but that appealed to me as i dont often read in the dark anyway for me no backlight means no buggy eyesi have used the experimental browser and its not too shabby i was able to download mobi files from other sources and they open just fine on the home screen i can also organize my books magazines and documents into collections which was never an option on the kindle tablets so im thrilled about thatand its light half the weight of my kindle fire so no more kindle elbow i know the battery wont last weeks for me because i read more than 30 minutes a day but even if it lasts for a few days rather than a few hours it will be awesomewhy 4 stars well im not crazy about the page blinking when you scroll down a list of books i dont know why that couldnt have been cleaned up since the tablets dont do that its my first ereader so maybe this is common i dont know but its annoyingbut i love this its very reasonably priced and i keep finding new features to love,love this ereader
2.0,i owned a kindle touch a couple of years ago and lost it and was hoping this newer one would be a good replacement im not so sure at this point because there are some key differences between the so called newer 7th generation and the one i had which i think was 5th generation1 the device never turns off the only choices are sleep mode and turning the screen off but any slight movement even after you have closed the top of the cover turns the screen back on again i think this is a waste of battery life my former kindle could be turned off when i was not using it and wanted to put it away2 the stability of the wifi connection navigating through the kindle store on the device is terrible and i am at home using the same home network that i used on my old kindle and on several other devices 2 tablets and 2 laptops the device moves quickly to the home page of the store but once you have picked a category and try to drill down into subcategories it seems to freeze and not go any further its faster to go on my laptop log into amazon and find an item to buy rather than make the purchase on the device that was never a problem on my old kindlebasically newer apparently is not always better in my opinion the 7th generation is not an improvement ive only had the kindle for a couple of weeks and i dont know whether to keep it or not i guess im just longing for my old kindle which gave me no problems,the older version was comparatively better
4.0,great ereader got it in the prime day sale for only 50 i do recommend getting a light maybe a case if you are going to travel take it to school or just clumsy like me the reason i gave four stars was beacuse when reading inside with a light i still got a glare its not bad enough to interup my reading but it is a disappointment if you have a light close up it can glare but outside or with a ceiling light it is great it also depends on the angle with close up lights the last pics are with the same light as second just different angle i wish that i could turn off one click payment on kindle store i had to turn kindle store completely off in parental controls so that if my kindle got stolen the couldnt use my one click payment method i just get books on my computer instead and send them to my kindle,great but not great
5.0,i finally got a kindle because i had to take a 3week trip to rotterdam from california i knew i would never be able to carry as many books as i would need especially since we were going to need to carry a number of things back with us it was a long flight with layovers both ways and sleeping was nearly impossible in the cramped planei loaded the kindle with ebooks i had a collection by one of my favorite authors and there are lots of free books to download and i decided to try kindle ultimate while i was at it and packed it into my computer bag it saved my life during the flight and the trip both my husband thinks i should have gotten the one with its own lighting but now that im home again access to a reading light is not an issuethe text is amazingly clearreally my graphics geek husband marveled over itand being able to adjust the size means that even if ive forgotten my reading glasses i can still read they dont always make it from one room to the other the faint gray tone to the background seems odd for a moment but then completely naturalbattery life has generally been very good it helps to actually turn the screen off when not reading i dont mind seeing the ads but they do use up power i left the wifi turned off the entire time i was in rotterdam and i think that helps save power tooi got the power adapter but since that only works in the us i just charged the kindle by connecting it to my computer now that im home i have the power connector next to my bed so i can charge while readingi expect to be buying ebooks rather than paperbacks from now on which is just as well as even my abundant shelving is starting to overflow i only wish i could rip my existing book collection to kindle format,the survival guide to overseas flights buy a kindle
5.0,,five stars
4.0,ebook readers occupy a very unique corner of the technology industry while every other form of technology benefits from better performance and higher specs this rule does not apply nearly as much to ebook readers just give me something that shows me words in black and white this is why the base model kindle shines and is in my opinion the best kindle currently availablei am coming from the first generation paperwhite i actually had a very negative experience with it the first problem i had was with the build quality the bezels on the paperwhite were very poorly glued on sitting slightly askew the uneven lighting didn’t help either i’m pretty ocd about things being perfect and these aspects really bothered me furthermore the rubberized coating felt pretty terrible when my hands got a little sweaty overall i was not satisfied with my paperwhitethe new 7th generation kindle solves most of the problems i had with the paperwhite the bezels are much more evenly glued on with this kindle the lack of an uneven front light is also an improvement in my book the material used for the kindle is a hard textured plastic which i actually find much nicer than the paperwhite’s material the thicker edges make it easier to hold while reading and it actually feels more like a real book for some reasonthere’s small details that i appreciate as well such as the kindle logo being black this makes it nicer to read with as the kindle icon blends in with the rest of the bezel i originally thought the new kindle had a capacitive touch screen and it was almost a deal breaker for me when i realized it was infrared however the touch screen is actually much better than i expected it is implemented very well in this device and it is as responsive as on the paperwhite the bottom bezel is also bigger than the paperwhite’s making it a good place to rest my thumb while using the kindleas for the new kindle voyage my main gripe is the price there’s no way i’m spending 200 for a single purpose device the glass display also means it doesn’t have the lay on the table design inherent to the standard kindle i don’t care too much about the higher ppi or haptic feedback or any of its other selling pointsi purchased my unit on black friday for 50 from best buy at that price this thing is a steal and is almost an impulse buy as long as youre ok without a built in light on your ereader the basic kindle is highly recommended i guess there’s a reason half of all kindles are purchased as presents but that’s not for me to talk about in this review,like that one toilet paper brand less is more
5.0,love love love my new kindlei have cataracts and light hurts my eyes with glare free background i can conitinue enjoying my favorite thing in life i have over 2000 books and with one touch after registration there they were i was even able to start a collection as it was so easy to doit is so much lighter than my other kindles well worth the price of 79 i would and will tell everyone about this kindleid like to give a special shout out to your support service they are the best and helped me so much over last 5 years,love love love my new kindle
4.0,i love having moved from the buttons to this value priced touch screen with two exceptions first i didnt realize how much i was depending on the texture on the back of my old kindle to keep from dropping it the cheaper plastic on this new model is super slick and dropable i added some textured stickers on day two of ownershipbut much more important brush the screen with the edge of your sleeve or heaven forbid place it face down in your lap for a sec and your font size will be changed at first i thought no big deal but i have been using my new kindle for two days and i have probably fix the font 100 times thats getting old fast and apparently touch kindle users have been asking for a font lock for at least two years,great but please give us a font lock
5.0,small light easy to carry even with the amazon case its perfect for reading outdoors and on flights,i love it
1.0,i lost my old kindle i dont like this one like my other one if you power it off it does not save the place where you left off reading even when you use the book marker also it keeps going back to the smaller print even though i change the font on the tool bar,i dont like this one like my other one
2.0,i was very happy with my old kindle with the little buttons at the bottom and the page turn buttons on the side when i finally broke the last one and all my warranty replacements were out get the warranty by the way outstanding deal good service i looked all over for a replacement but there were none to be had apparently this is the new generation of my kindle and i have to take what theyre offeringthe appearance of the visual interface is different and in my opinion less attractive than the oldthe new time left in chapter feature apparently thinks it takes me one minute to read a chapter no matter how long that chapter isthe distance between the power switch and the charger socket is increased which means i have to take the kindle out of its cover to charge itbut the worst is the touch screen i didnt want a touch screen but apparently i no longer have the option my hands tend to tremble which makes aiming at the small screen an adventure the sensitivity is such that sometimes the slightest breeze will cause the pages to turn and sometimes all the tapping in the world doesnt seem to work if i hold the kindle anywhere but the bottom i end up turning pages sometimes repeatedly so i wind up spending more time trying to get back to the place i was at than i do actually readingi was happy with the kindle i had but now i get to pay more for what i consider an inferior product that doesnt suit my needs anywhere near as well as the product it is intended to replaceprogressone potential positive the battery seems to last longer though it has only been a few days so i could be wrong about thatbring back the buttonsupdate its been about a month now and i hate the touch screen more than ever it keeps changing text size on me and every time i jostle it it turns the pagesthe touch screen seems very inconsistent with what portion of the screen does what when touched i can touch the same place 6 times in a row and end up anywhere within a twelve page span it goes back and forth seemingly at randomhighlighting and definitions are sometimes quicker but more often i spend more time trying to highlight just what i want to highlight than i did just pushing the buttonsthe edition of the bible i have had easily navigated chapter links so i could navigate quickly and easily with between the books and chapters during study classes now i cant even find the darn chapter links much less use themand the active content the word games that i used to love to playgone i cant play my word games on this version of the kindleive seen the comments here amazon you had a real winner with the last generation why not either bring it back or make it available new to those of us who prefer to buy it new the ball is in your court,higher price for an inferior product bring back the prior generation please updated
5.0,ive used tablets for years to read my kindle books using the kindle app for android but recently i bought a kindle paperwhite for my sightimpaired dad and i liked his so much that i bought a kindle for myself im finding the advantages to reading on a dedicated ereader over an allpurpose tablet well worth it for one ive been having a lot of issues lately with eye fatigue from working on the computer all day and reading on my kindle is far easier on my eyes reading on a kindle is very similar to reading the paper pages of a physical book i can see it definitely reducing my eyestrainthe other thing i like is that the battery on my kindle stays charged so much longer i had to plug my tablet in every few hours to recharge the battery its so much better to read my books anytime i want without having to worry about a low battery especially when im out and about in the waiting room at the doctors office etc at home i keep my wifi turned on at all times and the battery still loses only about a fourth of its charge during the day with me reading maybe a couple of hours a day i turn the wifi completely off on my dads and he reads mostly all day long and his battery still stays charged threequarters of the way both kindles even came with about a halfabatterys worth of charge already on them so you can setup your kindle before doing an initial charging which ended up taking only a couple of hours instead of the four that it recommends for a completely discharged batteryinitial setup of your kindle is super easy if youre an existing kindle user amazon already has you connected to your amazon account when you receive your kindle even connecting to my home wifi was easy just remember that if youve got a secured home network you need to enter your encryption key code not the regular network password its a onetime entry you can then connect and disconnect to your wifi at any time and it will remember your network unless you delete it from your kindles wifi settings your user manual is right on your kindle and it contains everything youll need to know about using your kindle also if you dont have a pc to plug your kindle into to charge it up you will need to buy a usb wall charger because all that comes in the box is the kindle and a usb cable i also ordered the omoton kindle smart case cover sold here on amazon by dealbarn for both my dads kindle and mine they are wellmade lightweight and fit the kindle perfectly closing the case cover automatically puts your kindle to sleep opening wakes it up so no having to push the onoff button easypeazy but be sure to order the omoton for the 7th generation kindle not for the paperwhite because the 7th gen kindle is just a fraction of an inch wider 47in as opposed to 46in for the paperwhitei ordered the glarefree kindle the one without the backlight with the specialoffer ads to save an extra 20 on the purchase price but i dont mind the advertisements at all you get a different ad on your splashscreen every time the kindle goes to sleep theyre almost always kindlerelated and actually a few of them ive clicked on because they were good deals on kindle books or accessories and if i want to read at night in the dark i can always read on my tablet because you can keep your books synced on all your reading devices with amazons cloud the only negative about the kindle and its not really a negative to me and might not be to you is that with the glarefree paperwhite and i think also the voyage kindles the book pages are blackandwhite only no color similar to reading a paperback book however like i said before when i do want to read in the dark or see the illustrations in color i can just read my books on my tablet so i actually have the best of both worlds i love my kindle,an allpurpose tablet user converts to kindle easier on eyes with superior battery life i love my kindle
2.0,the more gadgets they keep adding the less convenient the device becomes as a reading device touch screen why the big buttons we had on the side worked great now i cant remove a flick of dirt from my screen without turning pages i cant turn pages with gloves or my elbow for that matter i have to touch the screen all the time leaving smudges that i cant clean without turning more pages kindle store in the older versions the kindle store pages for books were standardized to fit in a single screen where you could see all important info now the processor is faster so they make you scroll to see the rest of the info the customer review score requires a scroll the product details number of pages for example requires a lot of scrolls and some things i just cant find at all edit there was a rant here about the book list being cover picture form i was shown that you can actually change the list back to the original text form from the menu so i removed the ranti hate this device the only reason i replaced my old one is it broke down but this isnt a good replacement it doesnt let me just read instead it distracts me with bells and whistlesthe touch screen is the most annoying feature as it actually interferes with the reading you keep touching so smudging the screen and you cant clean it without stopping so you try and keep reading with all the smudges and you cant really read while eating anymore as your hands are dirty and you dont want to touch the screenbut you cant get a kindle without a touchscreen now whose idea was it to use a touchscreen for a book and whose idea was it to force people to use touchscreen,the more gadgets they add the less convenient it is as a book 
1.0,i absolutely hate the 7th generation kindle the touchscreen is very sensitive and turns the pages so quickly that if you accidentally touch it you can find yourself many pages ahead very discombobulating and i really really miss the buttons on the side to turn the pages the screen seems to be more electronic looking than the traditional eink display i definitely think amazon should make a kindle with these features but not the base models this kindle lacks the simplicity of previous generations,hate the 7th generation
1.0,had i never owned another kindle this most likely would have received a higher rating unfortunately in comparing it to my older kindle the benefits of the touchscreen technology cant compare to the features no longer there for those of you unfamiliar with the older kindles nothing was touchscreen and instead was all keyboardbuttondriven with the keyboard builtin at the bottom of the kindle and the page turning buttons on both sides of the device yes it was a bit larger and heavier but it was so much easier to use than this new one with more features that are only available with a builtin keyboardi bought this to replace my older ailing kindle hoping the new one would fit into the old cover that i bought with a light in it and loved not only does it not fit there is no lighted cover to go with this new kindle even available considering how expensive that old cover was i wonder if all these different sizes and noncompatibility issues are ploys planned obsolescence on amazons part to force customers to have to spend a lot more money than is necessarypros lighter weight more secure in the separately sold cover if it’s being used only for reading and nothing else such as highlighting games etc it works wellcons other than turning pages by tapping on the r or l side of the display i haven’t found much about this new kindle to be very intuitive easy to figure out reading the 62page “kindle user’s guide 2nd edition” is pretty much a requirement although this guide comes with the purchase it would have been nice to be able to just start reading rather than spending hours figuring out the new features the new highlighting feature is so unusable it may as well have been removed instead of highlighting it literally darkens the selected text making it harder to read in my old kindle highlighting underlined the selected text which was nice it stood out without impairing legibility in addition have not found a way to highlight across pages ie if a section to be highlighted spans more than one page there doesnt appear to be a way to extend the highlight beyond the current screen the only workarounds i’ve found is either to separately highlight each page or to decrease the font size small enough to get everything onto one page the problem with the latter is it becomes much more difficult to then accurately select the section desired the fingertip is now proportionately so much bigger than the screen it tends to select 2 or 3 lines above or below whats wanted timeconsuming and frustrating certain games no longer work because they require a “keyboard” the game and the virtual touchscreen keyboard will no longer fit on this smaller kindle amazon will refund you for what you paid for the game in these cases but i’d rather have the games work for all the features lost with this new kindle you’d expect the new screen to be larger than it is actually it’s the same width as the old one and a tiny tiny fraction of an inch longer almost indecipherable for reading purposes have not noticed much difference between this supposed glarefree display and my older kindle even reading in the car on a sunny day theres not much difference you can see more of a glare in the photo i added but who regularly has that amount of light shining on the screeni have another 2 months to decide whether or not to return it since it was bought for me as a gift i’m disinclined to do this and if i’m using it primarily to read it works – except for the highlighting which i used frequently on my old kindle i consider this an inferior facsimile i hope this is not another case of amazon sacrificing features for the sake of profit,no comparison to older kindle
5.0,no once again there is no light why are you not reading the description those who are so offended by some reviews here ive taken a screenshot for you nobuiltinlight clear now,no built in light read the description
4.0,it is perfect in that i just wanted an ereader with no distractions so i focus more time on reading and one i could slip right into my purse i was at a medieval fair recently and purchased a little satchel that works perfectly for holding ereader and fire phonethe screen on this ereader is a bit dark i recently ordered a clip on reading light i think this will help immensely and bump it up another star for me i didnt realize that you cannot read in the dark with the kindle glare free without light in the room or a reading light i opted to order a clip on light rather than upgrade to the paperwhite to rest my eyes since i am on a computer all day at work and a tablet at home in personal timeive had the kindle fire 7 and the nook hd it took me a few moments to adjust to the light weight of the ereader and the matte finish of the screen but it is nice little reader overall,it is perfect in that i just wanted an ereader with no 
4.0,i am working on an ambitious project to study and learn five languages happily i have been able to download over 900 free foreign language kindle books and purchased the new kindle to help eliminate distractions from reading on a computerthe kindle is much darker than i expected i had hoped to be able to read wikipedia on the device but that is out of the question even with reading glasses i can read books fine because i can increase the font size a positive to the dark screen is that i can only see the picture and the title on the ads so they wont have any affect on mei find it more comfortable to use the blunt end of a pen than my fingers when i press on a word for a few seconds a dictionary will pop up in the language of the book i am reading if it is a dual language book like spanishenglish only the definitions for nonenglish words will show up which is not a problem for me of course if it is an english language book definitions in english will come up if you have wifi you can also have foreign words translated into english or a choice of over a dozen other languages very nicewhen searching for a book you cant simply flip through the pages of all of your titles you either have to enter an exact page number to go to or you have to type in the first few letters of the book title this is especially cumbersome when you are sifting through hundreds of books trying to put a collection togetherfor under 3 i was able to purchase a previous generation amazon kindle touch olive green genuine leather cover from ebay the new kindle snaps into the cover perfectly however it is thicker than the last version so the cover doesnt fully close there is about a 12 inch gap at the opening but the cover will still protect the device if you slip it into a side pocket of a purse or backpack the covered device feels great when held open like a book with the leather exposed on the back or when flipped in half like a magazine and the inside fabric of the cover is what you feel in your handi wanted a basic ereader and that is what i got i wont be able to use wikipedia but the dictionary makes up for that none of the other features interest me nor were they a selling point when i made my purchase,not perfect but its what i wanted
2.0,why does it look that is it supposed to look like that the background is not completely white i see letters in light black ink,why does it look like that
5.0,i have numerous kindles including the previous low end kindle which i use for running around i like having an inexpensive password protected device so that if i were to leave it somewhere i am not out a great deal of money and my credit cards are protected also the higher end devices have too much reflection to enable reading outdoors i dont take my higher end kindle devices out of the housei really didnt need this device but i was curious about it i then ran into a note which stated that staples had the device for 59 with a 30 rebate visa gift card i ran to pick it up available until 1227 fyiits a nice device the screen is very readable with good contrast the device and screen have a good hand feel its heavier than the previous kindle but not by much with a lightweight case its very portablethe interface is really a pleasure and im happy to be done with the scroll through keyboard which was on the previous device everything on this device is done via a screen tapthe new device has double the memory 4g as opposed to 2g on the previous device and is developed to enable updates which make it the equivalent of a paperwhite in functionality without the light of course so minus the light this device is incredibly well priced even at full retailif you need a light check out the medge cases which have a slip pocket into which you can insert one of medge eilluminator reading lights i prefer them to a clip on lighti use my kindles for different things my fires for films gaming and sometimes reading but for a true enhanced reading experience i use either my paperwhite my old touch or this new device i love the vocabulary builder function as well as xray i often read complex books ie mysteries or biographies and xray makes it much easier to keep characters terms etc straight i also have found that i prefer reading on a kindle to a book i find that i finish books more quickly and enjoy having the ability to read for a few minutes while waiting for an appointment etcif you are new to kindle and want a great reading experience this is a great place to start also if you need a gift or want to introduce children to an ereader this is an unbeatable opportunitya couple of tipsset up is easy and takes just a few minutes if you dont want to set up social media or join goodreads just skip them for now you can add them later you must be connected to wifi to set up your device so have your password handy if your wifi is password protected if you purchase from amazon via your account the device should already be set up for youthe device shows recommendations on the bottom of the home screen this takes up a lot of space which causes you to have to scroll through screens more often to view your library go to settings tap device options tap personalize tap recommendations and you can turn them off this will double your home screen display area and enables you to preserve the picture format for book display as opposed to a list formatquestions post and ill get back to youenjoy and happy holidays,great gift at a great price for the holidays and great reader tips included
3.0,i was so excited to receive my kindle 6 glarefree touchscreen display but was soon disappointed while i do like the layout of the screen ive come to realize constantly touching the screen is not as enjoyable as i thought it would be fingerprints i dont care for the virtual page turning and the beveled edges on the back cover feel uncomfortable while holding for me a flat surface is much more comfortablebut the deal breaker for me is its now heavier and a bit thicker 67 x 47 x 040 169 mm x 119 mm x 102 mm 67 ounces vs 5th gen kindle 65 x 45 x 034 16575 mm x 1145 mm x 87 mm 598 ounces the differences in weight may not sound like much but it was noticeable while holding for even a short period of time im just all around disappointedim going to take a chance on the kindle voyage which appears to have a flat back and lighter than the new kindle also the pagepress also sounds promising the ability to turn the page without lifting your fingerim sorry to say for me this new kindle missed the mark,im sorry to say for me the new kindle missed the mark
4.0,i am very happy with this purchase other than the fact it didnt come with a wall charger i am using my nokia 520 phone wall charger with this kindle 6 as you can see this kindle uses a micro connecter which most cell phones usethe screen is a light gray and the text is clear it doesnt have any back lighting speakers or headphone jack this kindle has a touch screen you will have to go through the difficult task of swiping your finger across the screen to turn pages if you have shakiness or tremors this in not the kindle for you as it would cause you a lot of frustration if you are new to the kindle world be aware that there is a learning curve the users guide answers most questions if you are stuck and cant figure out what to do call the kindle customer service there is no phone number only this online site address they are great to work withhttpswwwgooglecomsearchsitesourcehpqkindlecustomerserviceoqkindlegslhp1135i39l2j0i20j0l2j0i20j0l41928391507564880000347141623j250msedr01c162hp4411020c94otxssnoaif you have books on your computer unless they are epub files the kindle should be able to handle most files nook uses epub files and kindle uses mobi files i easily transfered most of my books from my computer to the kindle smoothly with out a hitch fyi you can not transfer entire folders only the files in side of them i would definitely recommend the kindle 6,great ereader
5.0,if youve used a kindle before and just want the simplicity of a great basemodel ereader then this is for you no keyboard no 3g no fancy color screen no backlight ads to offset the cost and you can pay to remove if they bother you i dont use it for apps or games or internet browser ive got my iphone for that i love that you can add your own ebooks i use calibre to manage the metadata,fantastic basemodel ereader
1.0,screen does not light up makes it very difficult to read at night the only reason i bought this kindle was to read on my breaks at night when i work it is useless to me now but i threw away packaging i will not by any more electronics it should have been made clear not to read at nighttime unless yo have a light,no display light disappointment
3.0,everything is good except that the screen display of scanned pdf file is even worse than the previous version my old kindle displays the pdf files perfect while the letters on the new one are thinner and some are dropped,it does worse when reading pdf files compared with the previous version
4.0,update 3 november 2014 its been a month and im happy to report my son has frequently read using this simple kindle hes still reading physical books from the library but weve purchased several books from amazon on this device and hes quickly and happily read through them due to the little smudge that developed on the screen ive put this in a case and i hope no more smudges appear battery life has been awesome in comparison to led devices and nobody has had to interrupt their reading to find a charger and its been fully charged maybe 3 times in a monthi bought this valuepriced kindle to solve a problem my 9 year old son loves to read he will tear through a harry potter book in a couple of days but he has no interest in reading on a regular tablet whether it be one of the ipads in the house or the kindle fire hd something about the experience basically staring at a white lamp for hours keeps him from enjoying it like he enjoys traditional paper books but paper books are bulky and accumulate and get kicked around the car and have to be returned to the library many times id just prefer to have the convenience of an ebookso when this new generation of kindle e ink readers were announced and at such a low price i impulsively put in a preorder i could cheaply experiment to see if it was right for my son this whole device costs less than the extended warranty on my ipadwhen it arrived i made an error i powered it on one of my children asked to see it i handed it over and when it was handed back it had been set to german and was midway through the tutorial you walk through to learn the basics of operating the kindle now my german has been completely unlearned since i was in college so i was at sea i needed to call kindle support to get me out of there by the way kindle support answered my call within a minute on a thursday afternoon and the pleasent man on the other end helped me get out of the tutorial and find my way to the comforts of american englishbut i had missed the tutorial and if there ever was a device that you need to absorb the lessons of the onboarding screens it is this single button kindle it has one of the least discoverable interfaces you are likely to encounter in this modern era of app design its filled with secret taps in regions of the screens and long presses to do something and swipes other places so it takes a while to get used to even if youve walked through the lengthy tutorialbut even given that my children both my 9 and 7 year old immediately fell in love with this little reader i signed up for a month of freetime so there was a little book contentnot enough but enough to get a quick tasteand i soon heard one of my favorite sounds my son chuckling at a book and then later my daughter who has just recently gotten seriously interested in reading borrowed it found in a book a demonstration of drawing the books cartoon characters and was happily copying them from the display onto paper soon after she asked me if the kindle could be hersso i am favourably inclined towards this device ive not been happy with amazons regular tablets they have not stood up very well in my household when competing with ipads but these e ink single purpose devices are a different animal by being better as a reader than a general purpose tablet not being backlit having ridiculously good battery life being very lightweight and being cheap enough that i dont have to worry too much about them breaking they comfortably fill a niche in my familys technology needs however in no way is this is a replacement for a general purpose tablet while it does have an experimental browser that is somewhat of a sad joke slow ugly and crashy something youd only find useful in an emergency nor is it a gaming machine or even good for books where photographs take a big role or with odd layouts like books for young children it has no sound input or output so no audio books or text to speech the screen doesnt even autorotate although it can be put in landscape mode this is a text reading machine period but a useful onebut not a perfect one a perfect device would instantly refresh like an lcd or amoled tablet this e ink device takes time to change its displayperhaps a quarter of a secondmaking navigation a clunky experience a perfect device would have paperwhite white backgrounds this one has a decidedly grey background for whiter you will have to pay more the resolution is just low enough that you can see the pixels in the fonts dont let this ruin it for you read the words and not the pixels a perfect device would have a more easy to access interface maybe even a couple more hardware buttons but a few hours of use will get you used to it and mostly forgetting the pain of learning whatever you do spend your time learning from the onboarding tutorialmy extended family has been tough on e ink kindles one of my brothers has broken two of the older models he had an unfortunate habit of sitting or sleeping on them so treat this thing gently and never place it in a back pocket even this new one after a couple weeks of wear has developed a smudge about the size of a lower case a towards the bottom left sidea perfect device would be on the internet all the time this one requires a wifi connection a frequent traveler will likely find the kindles with cellular service worth the extra upfront cost several years ago i bought one of my brothers such a kindle for when he was studying in rome and he used that feature all the time this is a wifi only device and it quickly found a couple of hubs in my house and i was able to enter my password and start downloading books from my account quickly if needed i could use my phone as a hotspot and get content on the go that waythe screen has a distinctly grey tinge and fonts are very dark grey so the contrast is middling there are a variety of font options baskerville caecilia caecilia condensed futura helvetica palatino and a publisher font which apparently allows publishers to embed their own preferred font or at least select it of these caecilia is the default and the best suited for the devices screen it minimizes the slight waviness of straight lines caused by the limitations of the underlying e ink technology the combined effect is reminiscent of printing with a very good dot matrix printer remember those onto fine recycled paperive subscribed to freetime for my children on my kindle fire hd in the past and eventually dropped it for lack of interest from them ive reactivated it for this device but unless they increase the number of books for their age brackets i will likely drop it again still its worth trying it out for a month and if you drop it amazon will refund you whatever portion is left in the monthxray is an interesting feature ive started to read the original james bond novel casino royale and its interesting seeing a graph of how characters like felix leiter pop up disaappear and reappear or a brief history of the peugeot company ive a feeling i wont be using this feature often it seems like a distraction from the text but perhaps for nonfiction it will end up being essentialthe ads on the lock screen have not been annoying and i barely notice their contentthere is no power adaptor in the boxpart of the low pricebut my house has dozens of usb charging ports and it includes a decent microusb charging cordto summarize a fine single purpose device hard to navigate but as a reader you will spend hours reading which it is great at and seconds navigating so the tradeoff is acceptable i like its low low cost especially as im handing it off to children but many will find the upsell to the whiter versions with cellular service worth the extra money,great once you start reading
5.0,i love my new kindle i love it because i read all of the specifications for the device this device does not have a backlight so if night time reading is your thing you might not like this version this is a very basic kindle that does not have many bells and whistles which is something i like because i own other devices like an ipad this device is very easy to use and comes with a tutorial when you set it up even if you some how miss the tutorial its easy to figure out how to configure the device the way you want it you can link it to social media if that is something you want to do i have linked mine to good reads but not facebook or twitter it comes with a usb cord for charging but does not include the wall adapter i knew this and plan to use the many wall adapters around the house i purchased the one with special offers but i hardly notice them plus i saw an offer for a cheap book i may want to purchase in the future or at least get from the library its a feature you could use to your advantageoverall this is a basic device and it does not pretend to be anything other than that if you have used something fancier you may be disappointed but for 80 you cant go wrong for a basic ereader,love my new kindle
1.0,disappointed,one star
4.0,great product i would recommend or buy againpros easy to read no eye strain affordable dictionary has easy access touchscreen makes the whole interface easier and simpler than the previous version the home screen is not so oldfashioned looking it does what it needs to docons it is a tiny bit bigger just enough so that it doesnt fit in my other case the touch screen is activated by things other than your finger leading to accidental page turns font size changes etc this is the worst aspect i have discovered thus far touch screen is not as accurate as other touch devices can be this isnt too noticeable,it does what it needs to do
5.0,i wish i had bought a kindle sooner let me preface this by mentioning that when a family member got a 4th generation kindle about 2 years ago i could not figure out how to use it the small buttons and no keyboard drove me crazy trying to type in what i wanted trying to navigate on the kindle screen to purchase or find books and downloading books i found the page turn buttons to be annoying and it was too easy to accidentally press them while reading i couldnt figure out where to put my hand to hold the kindle while avoiding the page turn buttonsthe kindle touch has changed all of that its easy to navigate and easy to type because its all touch responsive you dont have to worry about turning the page unless you touch your finger to the screen and because of this turning the page is really easy built into the kindle interface i can hold my finger on a word i dont know and it will give me a definition of that word in my choice of 2 dictionaries the lack of buttons on the bottom gives you ample space to place your thumb to grasp the kindle and the same for the edges on the left and right of the screen to rest your finger of the same hand for stabilization to make things even easier i purchased popsockets to put on the back so i can hold it with a flat handmy only caveat is that there is no light which i knew before purchasing but the screen is somewhat darker than expected its not as bright as a piece of paper in front of you its a shade or two dimmer in daylight or indoors this is not a problem but if you read in bed at night with a low watt lamp next to you youre going to want the screen to be brighter if i could turn the light off completely on the voyager i would have opted for that one in retrospectthings i like touch screen no buttons easy to navigate and type because of the touch screen space to grasp due to no buttons small power button on the bottomthings i dont like the screen is dimmer than expected and has no light to compensate only comes with a usb cord to charge off of your computer no wall plug i use the base from the iphone charger with the kindle usb the lack of a charging base is clearly a way for amazon to earn extra money when you purchase the wall plug but if you want to look at it from a positive perspective for the many who refuse to pay extra money for the wall plug providing only the usb cord is ecofriendly and minimizing technological waste being sent to guiyu china the ewaste recycling hub of the world to be recycled when we no longer want our used electronics children and adults alike in the city of guiyu are getting sick from lead poisoning and various other ailments from the toxicity of the air water and direct exposure to heavy metals from inside our electronics the ads and having to pay 20 to remove them is cheap marketing where amazon is profiting off of you seeing the ads and profiting off of you not wanting to see them clever but not classyunknownshow easily does the screen dent does it need a screen protector or a hard case to protect the screenupdate 7 months later i still love my kindle i had no idea i would ever love it this much i dont go anywhere without it,i love it and you will too if you dont mind that the screen is surprisingly dimmer than expected

1.0,questiontrying to decide which kindle to buy for someone else i have a keyboard kindle and my son has a fire so we are well versed in kindles my question is thisis there a lighter case that you can buy for this version of kindle all the cases for the 7th generation kindle which i assume this is are very specific to say that they will not fit older version kindles however none of them have a built in light the only cases i can find with the built in light are for the 5th generation kindle i am having a very hard time determining 1 will a 5th generation compatible case with built in light will fit this kindle or 2 is there a case with a built in light for this version any feedback would be much appreciated,question about cases
1.0,it is too complicated to use i really dislike it,i really dislike it
1.0,a total piece of junk,one star
1.0,i have not had an opportunity to use the kindle yet i have a bad experience with staples where i purchased the device and may have to return it to the store i believe the product will probably satisfy my needs but i purchased it as part of a staples rebate promotion which so far they have refused to honor hopefully staples will resolve this issue and i will then begin using the kindle,i have a bad experience with staples

1.0,top half of my screen is frozen all of a sudden tried restarting multiple times and the issue persists i have used this for about year and a half very disappointed that when i called customer service i was told that they cant do anything about it as the device is out of warranty at best they could offer me another kindle for 87one of the supervisor even told me that the device lasted for 18 months and i should be happy about it there is not guarantee that even if i buy another one i may not run into the same issuemy device has always remained in the case from day 1 and i havent dropped it or abused it sorry if this is the quality of the product i dont think ill buy another kindle again,very disappointed that when i called customer service

1.0,my husband purchased the kindle 5 for me as a christmas present 2 years ago i was very sick at the time and only just got around to using it after using it for less than a month the screen randomly broke no physical impact i have heard stories online of many others having this same experience so its clear theres a design flaw with the screen however amazon refused to provide a replacement saying the warranty had expired regardless of the fact that the device has only been in use for a month in the past my experience with amazon customer service has been exceptional disappointed to see that their commitment to customer satisfaction is waning,design flaw but amazon refused to replace
1.0,no back light no light at all was not registered nor loaded with my paid for booksnot acceptable as a replacement or anything else,no back light no light at all was

1.0,everyone beware there a site that advertises amazoncom deals called dealspluscom they showed the following discount deal amazon is offering the new kindle touch screen ereader with light for 49 plus follow the instructions below to get a free 4347 amazon credit i purchased it only to find out it does not come with the light i called amazon to rectify the error but was told there was nothing they could about the false advertisement except cancel the order even if the purchase was made through amazon website directly very disappointed i canceled the order it was going to be a gift good thing i checked before item was given as a present on christmas day i wouldnt even recommend a star for this but at least they canceled the order before i was billed too bad amazon is usually great with their offers,buyer beware
1.0,its not what i expected i bought a refurbished 6 kindle because i thought it would have the game every word n it and it doesntbig disappointment,big disappointment
1.0,this represents a giant step backwards,one star
4.0,i seriously love the case and i wish i could give it like a 48 but they dont have that option the only problem i have is that you slide the kindle through the top but there is not way to secure it in there afterwards the top part is just exposed not a deal breaker though great price and its sturdy the color turned out a little darker pink than the picture but thats okay because i like the color better i like this case better than most of the others ive seen so i highly recommend it ,yay i love it
1.0,i am totally for touch screen and totally okay without light but why no one ever mention there is delay in responding to practically every command and the screen flashes turns black before it shows the new page whenever you switch page which i found very annoying but mostly because the delay is it just me did i get a defective producti dont care about touch screen and light but i really cant put up with such slow machine,why nobody mention these problems
5.0,this is my first kindle i own a lot of gizmos but never owned a tablet or an ebook reader of any kind simply because i never had the need my smart phone laptop or desktop suited my needs just fine and there was never a need for an inbetween device this has now changed as i have found myself reading more ebooks and finding my smart phone screen too small and my laptop too unwieldy and too likely for my short attention span to stray into doing something else other than readingthe good opening the box the kindle was smaller than i thought it was going to be even though i knew the size its not a bad thing having used it for a while it does feel about right to me another thing i was surprised with was the quality of the touchscreen i was expecting it to be frustrating to use but it was rather pleasant further i thought i was going to feel annoyed at having to touch or swipe the screen instead of using the side buttons as on previous models but i have actually found myself not minding itthe set up was fairly straight forward and so is the general use of the kindle getting around is fairly intuitive for the most part and i think overall the kindle has been put together well though for some reason i find myself tapping the centre of the screen to get the navigational menu up instead of at the top of the screen which inadvertently causes me to skip forward i dont know why i have this inclination but its annoyance not the kindles fault at all merely frustrated at myselfthe bad these are minor gripes but i still feel i need to state them firstly id like the power button at the top of the kindle it seems really weird to have it at the bottom secondly this isnt as annoying as the first point but having a home button would be nice too having been trained by various smart phones and tablets to use the home button to get to start of something i think this gripe would be probably shared by most even though it is far from a deal breaker in any case neither point is a deal breaker and im still really happy with the device,overall a great product for a great price
4.0,okay im giving it four stars just because my kindle was the 3rd gen and this is pretty much the same thing it gets the job done here is my issue i dont mind it not being lit but i do have a problem with there not being a cover available with a built in light besides some cheap third party ones that get soso reviews yes amazon makes a clipon light but it is very inconvenient to have one of those i got this as a gift and didnt realize i would have such an issue finding a cover with a light if i had known i wouldnt have opened the kindle and would have sent it back to exchange for a paperwhite so be aware that this can only be read in well lit areas since getting a decent cover and light for it is nearly impossible sogood for beach reading not good for reading before bed,hard to find covers with builtin light for this not for bedtime reading 
1.0,ive owned 5 kindles now the first one the battery would no longer charge the second one i dropped and the corner turned black which interfered with reading the third one i had sitting on the bed and accidentally leaned on and it separated from the frame and wouldnt work anymore and this one is the fourth one ive since ordered a used like new kindle like my second and third one because i hate this one so much i wont use it anymore let me explain one thing i love new electronics while everyone is complaining about how it used to work fine im excited to see what they changed because more than not i love it not so this kindle first off i cant even begin to express how cheaply made this kindle is its light alright because its made out of cheap cheap cheap plastic i can just envision it cracking with the slightest bang i thought the idea of the touch screen was a great idea and no more typing on the tiny keyboard on the bottom that was designed for little mouse feet wonderful uhno while the keyboard is fantastic the problem is with the touch screen in general there are no longer tabs on the side to turn your page forwards and backwards instead page turning is done by lifting your finger and tapping or swiping a certain area on the kindle half the time its unresponsive and doesnt turn the page the other half its either turning it in the wrong direction and yes i am smart enough to tap it in the correct spot i cant express how frustrating and annoying this is and if youre like me and read in bed i lay on my left side and hold the kindle with my right hand when they had the tabs on both sides backwards and forwards was equally accessible now if you have the kindle in your right hand and want to go back a page you must reach all the way across to the other side of the page to tap the small area designated for turning the page back on the other hand literally if youre on your right side and turning with your left you have to reach across to tap the area to move forward and try and avoid the area designated for backwards and half the time youre turning the page in the wrong direction and if you are like me and like larger print you are constantly lifting your thumb to tap the page to turn it it also randomly changes your font and god forbid you need to lay it down during use and you happen to touch the screen or your cat walks on it when you come back to read its either highlighted a word and the dictionary is up or its changed your font or youre on a page that you didnt leave it on i just plain hate it i see the new kindle now has page sensors on the side similar to the original ones i must assume from this that i am not the only one who hates this design i was thinking of purchasing one of those but they dont look ready for primetime either there are a multitude of complaints that they had a twotoned colored screen and the touch screen on this one reminds me of an old pantech phone i had that was supposed to have a touch screen like a smartphone no no no not even close its not responsive like a touch screen should be it lags and is super frustrating so i just spent 79 on this piece of garbage and i really dont want to invest another 200 in something else that will aggravate the hell out of me so now i ended up buying an old kindle for 8300 not happy with this at allupdate i contacted amazon and got a full refund with no hassles ill be sending it back shortly and i got my new old kindle today and am soooo happy what a relief i just hope it lasts until amazon can figure out that we dont want to do gymnastics to turn pages and would like to be able to actually touch the screen of our kindle to lay it down without it spazzing out,the only kindle ive ever actually hated
5.0,love it best purchase will never leave home without,love it
5.0,ive been using the kindle 7th gen for about a week now i used to use an ipad to read but i sold that and decided to purchase this kindle because it was on special for 59 i love the size and portability of this device it is so lightweight and easy to transport i love the viewing of the screen because i can use it not only inside but outside as well i have no complaints about this device i have added a photo to show you guys the size comparison to a standard notebook,great ebook reader
1.0,got a lemonas a previous kindle with keyboard ownerim very disappointed with this touchscreen version i miss the simplicity of the left and right buttons to turn the pages and the ease of the keyboard my touchscreen kindle keeps restarting and froze the day i opened it while trying to download a book from my cloud and now i have to wait for my replacement until amazon has them back in stock in 2 weeks not happy right now,im very disappointed with this touchscreen version
5.0,what can i say its a kindle its one of the best ebook readers on the market it has more features than any of the others and very fast when loading this is my 3rd kindle and i have never been disappointed with any of my kindles performance if anything they inspire me to want to read even more this kindle is light in weight and the price is truly unbeatable especially since i purchased this one when it was discounted at 59 you will not be disappointed in this ereader,best kindle ever so far thank you amazoncom
1.0,dont like to write low review for a kindlei got this on prime day i like the new goodreads linked accounts also the size of this one but for some reason i couldnt access the lending library after looking in different blogs amazon videos and so on i decided to call customer service first person really nice did everything she could but no success then she passed my call to another area the person that was trying to help me was treating me like a moron she kept insinuating that i was doing wrong the things she was telling me and she kept breathing hard in a ways of saying i can’t believe you can’t see that i told her few times i can send you a picture of the screen and you will see the “all collections” button is not here but she kept with the attitude at one moment i told her something like “you been insinuating that i can’t follow simple instructions and you don’t get to understand that the link is not here” also she made me do the same thing few times they kept me 130hr “maybe more” on the phone and when she finally decided that it was time to do something else and replace the kindle she told me that because i was not living in us they had to ship my kindle to a different address in fl my grandmas what this got shipped to pr and has to be sent back to pr that’s what a think should happen and she kept telling me that fl was the best option yeah for you but if i had agreed who was going to pay me that shipping from us to pr me anyways she finally found a way to do it but after a 130 her attitude and the “yeah because you don’t live in the us they should send me an upgrade of the kindle with a “thank you for being a customer note” i am a happy prime member and buy almost everything at amazon i tell everyone i know how gorgeous amazon and prime are but mad at the service i received this is no way of treating a customer,bad customer servece nice kindle no voiceover or light

2.0,i bought this to hopefully replace my 3yearold kindle keyboard 3g however i had to send this new kindle touch back compared with my old kindle this new version has much more visible pixilation in the text something i simply cannot tolerate after not having to deal with junky text on my old kindle the back of the new kindle is also poorly designed as it has a ridge along that juts awkwardly into ones hand unlike the smoothbacked kindles of old i guess i will have to hope my old kindle has some more life left in it or that the kindle voyage turns out to be as worth the price having tried a kindle paperwhite and not been impressed with the fonts or backlight the kindle voyage had really better be fantastic otherwise i will definitely regret tying myself to amazon with so many kindle book purchases in recent years,cheap quality and inferior print to older models
5.0,bought this for my 11 year old son and he loves it the only thing he doesnt like is that it isnt like the paperwhite like i have where the screen lights up so he can read in the dark hahasince i bought this for him he has been reading up a storm it has been so hard getting him to pick up a book i even tried getting him to read on the kindle app but that was a nogo i used to be against these ereader things when they first came outbut nownow i love them so much if they can get my son to read i am all for it best purchase ever,excellent buy
3.0,we didnt receives the charger head would you pls mail it to us ,three stars
2.0,i ordered this for my 90year old father who has had 2 kindles other to date this was to replace his previous version which after a year experienced some sensitivity and irregularity in page keys this touchscreen version did not work out at all for him he would accidentally hit the screen end up pulling up a menutask bar and lost in how to find his way back to his book the instructions are too cryptic and assume an advanced user therefore no help for him or mehe just wants a simple way to read a book via kindle i gave him the one i bought 4 years ago and it still does the trick forget all the bells and whistles,lets get back to basics
5.0,i didnt need a new kindle i have a keyboard kindle that works quite well but i began to see the ads for this one and after reading about it comparing it to the others and seeing how affordable it was i decided that it would be a good thing to have my son is an avid reader and is always asking for books for his birthday or christmas my justification for buying a new kindle was this if i get a new one and keep the old one in my name then when i buy a new book hell also be able to read it so instead of buying him a new book i have given him approximately 250 books including his favorite author stephen king and the ability to read many more im also impressed with this new one its easy to handle easy to read compact but not phone size now im just waiting for the new cover for it so i can pack it around with me yep im happy,i decided that it would be a good thing to have
5.0,this is a great little device i feel the need to defend it from its detractors by echoing what some other reviewers have said about it dont blame your kindle for you not having read the product description it doesnt have a light you turn the page by touching the screen you need to be connected to wifi to download a book if you understand that youll enjoy it pros long battery life good amount of storage awesome price it would be kind of nice if there was a help option on the device itself instead of having to go to the amazon website but thats a nonissue once you get the hang of how to navigate everythingthe setup tutorial it goes through when you first turn on the device is pretty thoroughif youre not concerned about your kindle having a light or 3g access buy this model the complaints about no page turning buttons are ridiculous and shouldnt even be a factor,awesome
1.0,i never received my order i needed it for my textbooks and probably will fail the classes which cost 2500,i never received my order
1.0,i have been a long time amazon customer and very satisfied with my purchases and the service but this new version of the basic kindle is worthless the screen is very difficult to read unless you are in very bright light it is like trying to read a very old newspaper by candle light i bought this on the 20 down and 4 equal payments i returned it the day after i received it and am now told i cannot purchase the next one up paperwhite on the same program basically i burned the promotion on the crappy one and now cannot take advantage of it for one that actually works i was also told that i could do it if someone else had an account that i could use my daughter has an account and when we tried the promotion does not even show up when she is logged in perhaps because we have the same address either way it sucks,dont bother with is version
4.0,not as good a i had hoped the screen does not light up and i expected that it would,four stars
3.0,i purchased this kindle for my father after he broke his kindle keyboard he used his kindle now and then and after talking with him we decided on this version instead of one more expensivevery quickly we discovered something rather upsetting which took nearly an hour of online digging to confirm it has no speakers my dad started collecting audio books and would listen to them at night no where on the product page does it state there are no speakers had i known this before i would have gone with a paperwhite which i myself ownboth of us have struggled with this kindles touchscreen i use touchscreens all day long including a paperwhite with no problems there are delays between tapping and the reaction at times which prompts you to double tapbesides these two things the kindle works as advertisedi would like to see amazon drop the current shape and material for the slimmer more rounded design they used before while i wouldnt count that as a negative it is not a positive either,kindle lost its voice

2.0,i had another kind of kindle before this one the one with the keypad at the bottom the one that allowed pages to be turned by pressing buttons on the side of the kindle that one was stolen and i was very disappointed to learn that that style was no longer available it was so simple to operate and had none of the extra sensitivity that this touchscreen model has which frustrates me a lot you have to touch it with just the right amount of pressure or it does something you dont want it to do everything is different about this kindle and i dont like any of the difference it is not an improvement as far as i am concerned quite the opposite but i had no choice and i dont like that either i find it difficult to touch the screen just right and in the right place to go to the home site and an incorrect touch often brings up a message of some sort that i did not want ive had it for three weeks and still dont feel comfortable with it is this enough of a review one more comment i hate it,and i was very disappointed to learn that that style was no longer available

1.0,this isnt so much a review of the product which is fine so much as a review of amazons advertising i received an email from them telling all the features of their new kindle voyage and boy did it sound great the whole email was all about it with pictures of only the voyage then at the bottom of the email is a large button that said buy the new kindle for 79 so my birthday was coming up so i forwarded the email to my wife she thought it looked great and ordered it it shows up around my birthday and were both wondering why its thicker than the ad and what happened to the backlight go back to the email ad and see that the kindle she ordered is just called kindle but the more expensive models like the voyage 200 have names to us they are all kindles i wasnt about to send it back cause it is pretty neat but i have to read at night with the light on in closing amazon you get one star for shty advertising,great product deceptive ad
3.0,i recently upgraded my kindle 5th generationside buttonsmultidirectional keypad to this current version touchscreen kindle because amazon was offering a tradein on the old kindle plus 20 credit plus towards a new one and a 20 discount off the regular price after all of that it only cost me 639 which seemed like a perfect time to upgrade after spending some time with the new kindle i came away with mixed feelings with this new kindle compared to my old 5th gen kindlemy initial impressions are it’s of similar dimension to my old kindle but more chunky and feels a bit heavier overall holding it in one hand i notice that the all plastic body is quite slippery and not really grippy at all compared to my old kindle which is a bummer with my old kindle i would be able read it in one hand and turn pages as well with this new kindle its a challenge to hold it in one hand for any extended amount of time to read without it slipping out of my hand also its a bit uncomfortable to hold because of its chunkiness as well i wish this new kindle had a grippy material on the backside like my old kindle did which was slim and just much easier for onehanded reading it seems that amazon purposely designed this new kindle to be put in a case as its just not grippy at all to me and it looks pretty cheap too i prefer to read without any type of case but because of this i may decide to go with a case afterall the build qualitydesign also doesn’t seem quite up to par because it just comes off as a cheaplooking slab of plastic with not much of a design emphasis so i would recommend getting a case to aid in grippiness and to hide the drab look of this kindlethe touchscreen looks very much like my old kindle in size and clarity this kindle is suppose to have 171 ppi and “sharper and bolder text” however compared to my old kindle i don’t really notice much of a difference for comparison i used a 5th gen kindle from a family member and compared them side by side using the same page from the same book and with the same bookerly font i may even say that my old kindle has a little bolder text compared to the new kindle which seems to be on the lighter side despite its claims to “sharper and bolder text” in its description so the screen hasn’t impressed me much eitherthe touchscreen responsiveness is fairly good and the page swipes seem quicker than what i’m use to on the old kindle but not by much page swipes are done by actually swiping across the screen or just tapping in the leftright margin or middle of the screen tapping at the top brings up the menu with various functions and access to settings which is little more convenient than my old kindle one thing i’ve noticed is that the text onscreen doesn’t actually utilize the whole screen depending on the book the top margin starts lower than my old kindle because of this “tap to access menu” function that’s about an inch of wasted space in the top margin on every page which is disappointing to say the least especially on a 6” screen this doesn’t happen with every book for some reason so this may be some glitch with a particular book on my 5th gen kindle this never happened at all but something to note on this newer kindle as it may be indicate buggy issues with the softwarethe storage is 4gb for even a 1000 more books which is double my 5th gen kindle but it’s not really important to me as i keep most of my books in the cloud and only keep what i’m currently reading and some other ebooks i may read down the road on the kindle once i’m done i usually keep any purchased ebooks but not obviously any borrowed ebooks from the library i will never have a need to keep my entire library of ebooks on the kindle at one time unless there some type of apocalypse happens that lasts years and years if that happens the kindle would probably be fried anywaybattery life seems to be similar to my old kindle as i’ve not had to charge it yet as of this review it came shipped with about 6070 battery life hopefully it will last as long as my old kindle time will telli do like some of the new features like being able to browse through page by page or chapter by chapter without losing your place in the book this is probably the best new feature of the kindle that i didn’t have on my old version the goodreads collaboration xray word wise vocabulary builder bookmarks with pip preview and “xx mins left in chapter” are some of the other various new features that i like as well all of these can be accessed while in book without going to the home page which makes it more convenient i do wish there was a toggle at the top menu bar for airplane mode onoff instead of needing to go into settings like my old kindle i’m usually on airplane mode but there are times that i need to go on wifi to download a book or sync my progress to other devicesso i would probably recommend this 7th gen kindle for someone who doesn’t have an ereader or are new to ebooks and want something relatively affordable but if youre thinking of upgrading your existing 5th gen kindle and is working fine i would hesitate to recommend it because of its poor build quality drab styling slippery feel and grip and underwhelming screen if you need the new features and don’t care about any of the previous mentioned cons and just want to stick this in a case then this may be the kindle for you especially if you can get it at a good deal like i did but in my opinion at 79 or even 59 on sale this is not really worth it if you have a goodworking older kindle also there is the kindle paperwhite which has a better screen with builtin light but at a 40 premium still may be worth considering if youre serious about ereaders for 639 it was a very small investment for me that had some upgraded features but came with flaws as well now in the mean time i’ll be searching for a nice case to cover up the kindle,upgraded from a 5th gen kindle but with mixed feelings
1.0,in a comparison with my 4th generation basic kindle who has now passed on after 3 years this product is inferior in nearly every wayit feels and looks a lot more clunky youre gaining a noticeable amount of weight and thickness in exchange for a touchscreen feature the purpose of purchasing a basic kindle for me at least is to read plain and simple i only have two requirements for the kindle 1 small and lightweight and 2 easy page flipping any advantage gained by touchscreen is far outweighed by the loss of the page buttonsi experimented with a number of hand positions and even though i could flip pages with my thumb if i really contorted my hand it seemed a decent portion of time id highlight something instead attempting to do flip back a page is 10x harderi read with both my kindle fire and the basic kindle the basics niche is that it is lightweight and portable and provides easy 1handed use this product fulfills none of my requirementsi would recommend the paperwhite or the voyage personally returning the basic for one of those,horrible design tempted to smash with hammer after 1 hour of use
3.0,first off i would like to share that i owned the kindle keyboard the kindle fire hd and now i have the kindle hd 6 so i have had experience with a few different models i purchased this model because i wanted a reader i could take outdoors when my children were playing that wouldnt distract me from reading like my kindle fires end up doingthis model is very basic its good over all the touchscreen works very well and it does what its supposed to do but i wasnt happy with the darkness of the screen i felt like i needed a little more contrast between the background and the actual fonti ordered the paperwhite to see if the difference would justify the extra expense for me it definitely does the background light makes a huge difference im sending this one back and keeping the paperwhiteall in all its a great reader for the price has all the basics just not the reader for me though,good but basic
5.0,i bought this as a beach kindle because im not comfortable taking my voyage to the beach ironically enough this kindle does everything that i could have expected it to do and does it well as ive come to expect from amazon im very pleased with my purchase, bought this as a beach kindle because im not comfortable taking my voyage to the beach ironically enough
4.0,overall i am enjoying this a lot one thing i dont like however is that the screen is extremely sensitive and even the tiniest of touches will advance the page and lose my place also the part of the screen that you press to go to the previous pages really only works reliably once if you want to go back two pages at a time youre almost screwed it has been hard for me to figure out how to do that as the device wants to interpret the second touch as a go forward command and you wind up going in circlesin the plus column i am very happy that amazon has continued the eink format i read ten times as much when i dont have glare giving me a migraine,one thing i dont like however is that the screen is extremely sensitive and 
4.0,i purchased this to supplement a 1st generation ipad mini its exactly what i expected to be a simple device to read ebooks on so i dont stare at an lcd screen all day especially in situations where tablets get too much glare the build quality though does feel a bit on the cheap side coming from a higher end tablet but for 79 its fineamazons integration with overdrive is great too for checking out library books the ads on the lock screen really arent too bothersome at all,what i expected
1.0,i hate thisi prefer a paper book that i can read pages turn them hilite in themvery hard for me to understand this and i am trying to sell it as we speak,i hate this
3.0,i previous had the kindle keyboard and was devastated when after 5 years of use the screen had some major issues that couldnt be fixed please note i travel constantly and even though i always kept it in a case it definitely had some tough love but worked great up until the endthe new kindle has the same great screen without glare its easy to navigate to order books use the dictionary while reading highlight quotes in books and set up wifihowever it was easier to turn it on and off on the kindle keyboard interfacethe one major downside to the new kindle is the touchscreen sensitivity i frequently read in bed and if my blanket grazes the screen it changes pages font size or resets me to the beginning of the my book theres no adjustability that im aware of in the settings and every night when i read i miss the buttons to turn the pages,screen is way too sensitive
1.0,its not what i expected ,one star
4.0,my kindle is greatbut when reading sometimes the book page flips 2 pages at a time when the screen get touchedplease fix this bugoverall im very satisfied with my kindle and i think im not going to read books with my ipad anymore,my limitless entertainment
3.0,not what i expected like size hate i cant read at night will like it outside reading should have read small print,an not read in dark
1.0,,one star
1.0,this is the most disappointing product i have ever purchased from amazon and i am hoping there is some exchange policy in place because i absolutely detest this product and am extremely disappointed,lose this product well below amazon standards
1.0,i got my kindle 6 glee free screen as a gift and i love it, 6 glee free screen as a gift and i love it
1.0,i did not get my kindle and nobody is helping me am i getting it or are you crediting my account what are you doing,i did not get my kindle and nobody is helping 
1.0,would give this negative stars if i couldfirst of all you have to load the books from your cloud account one at a time and i have over 1000 books so it took 12 hours even loading it in 10 book blocks takes that long they really should find some way to assist customers with this but just say sorry if you asksecond i found that my active content games would not download to this new 7th generation kindle so i called to see where to find the games for this generation i thought perhaps i would have to switch to aps like the fire instead of the active content or something like that you wont believe this the 7th gen new kindle does not do games or active contect or aps or anything just books and documents my 4th gen even does active contentapparently this 7th gen kindle is not as evolved as the 4th generation that i have been using for 2 years to be honest it looks and sounds just like the old touch that they dropped over a year ago for being too behind the times they say it isnt but it works the same way and has the same limitations but even the touch did active content for games etcanywaylook outi just got stuck and cant return it fast enough this leaves me with a dying 4th gen and no where to go but somehow a downgrade just is not going to do it,does not do games like the old ones do
1.0,no light cant see once it get dark outside,one star
1.0,this is the worst kindle i have ever had i wanted one w a light and never dreamt that i would not be able to find one it has been a hassle from the beginning very bad product and i wish i would never have ordered,this is the worst kindle i have ever had
3.0,it pains me to say that i only have a single major complaint otherwise this feels like a 5star productthe grey screen is too dark it is too dark in dim light and it is too dark in bright lighthere at my computer in my normal lighting situation the room is dim im using the light from the lowest 13w settings of an 3way efficiency bulb in a shaded lamp and have the glow of two monitors this is just enough light for most things from balancing my checkbook to looking up which special characters i used in a particular password to yes casual reading this is enough light to read white paper by now grey paper when newspaper or irs tax booklets may indeed need more light which is fine because i have two more clicks on my lamp so i have suffered mildly trying to use my kindle in this dim situationi had thought fine ill just have to use this in bright light alas that doesnt work well either being in a bright room naturally constricts my pupils so that i need more light the contrast on the kindle is thus effectively worse looking around the room everything is bright and cheery until you look at this device and i wonder what this murky grey thing is doing here i have to concentrate to read it in bright light too in bright situations if my eyes are adjusted to reading on this then i actually feel the need to turn down the lights in my environmentto repeat myself in summary the grey kindle screen is too dark in dim light its too dark in bright light great product otherwise,the grey screen is too dark
5.0,i received the amazon kindle on the release date of october 2 thus far i have been very happy with it i have the kindle fire and the kindle fire hd and have been pleased with them however i wanted something that was more exclusively an ereader with the glarefree screen that i could take with me on the go for reading i have my smartphone with me when i am out or at work so bringing a kindle fire with me seemed redundant i also rationalized my purchase of yet another kindle by the fact that when i read on my other kindles i am easily distracted by the other apps and end up spending too much time with those rather than enjoying readingi like the screen and the size i find it much easier to read than my other kindles even with their matte screen protectors the touchscreen is a nice addition with this version i am used to this with my other kindles so it is an easy transitioni also like that you can organize your books that is something that i had longed for with my other kindles i think it will be nice to file away the books that i have read and the books to be read i can think of all kinds of possibilities for this feature i had been considering the previous generation which i think was 69 as opposed to 79 and i am glad that i waitedi may update when i have had the product longer,kindle 7th generation with special offers
5.0,i bought this kindle because i love to read and my first generation kindle died it was easy to upload my unread books load some more and head to the beach i dont mind the ads because they arent too obtrusive and i tend to ignore them i didnt see the need to pay extra to exclude ads this kindle is compact and fits in a small pursei also have an ipad but it is impossible to read outside and it doesnt fit in a small purse in the picture below the kindle is upright so it can be seen but i can lay it down and zip the purse,a no frills ereader
3.0,i had the kindle a generation before this one which i loved but it broke one day after a friend sat on it i thought that the new generation could only be better but i was wrong the last generation was thinner and lighter though this generation is still pretty light its heavy enough for me to feel that itd slip when only holding it with one hand granted i have small hands also the black framing looks thicker and the screen looks smaller i feel that the touchscreen is unnecessary for a simple ereader especially if you use it mainly for reading and not for taking notes which is what i do i loved the buttons on the side used to change pages in the previous version but they have been changed to swiping the layout of the home page etc is more cluttered now if im remembering my old kindle correctly it might be weird that im complaining about it having more functions but i feel that a kindle ereader should stay simple and do its job be as portable as possible be efficient to use and show me my books anything else is superfluous and you might as well buy a tablet,more is not always better
5.0,perfect for what i got it forreading outside hello beach here i come,five stars
1.0,not satisfied,kindle
5.0,this is my second kindle an upgrade from a 2nd generation keyboard model it still worked but the prime day deal was irresistible i am so glad i took the plunge the new kindle is lighter and smaller but has a larger reading area handling it is similar to a paperback once its in a case open it and you see the last thing you saw when you closed it how easy is that i find the text to be as crisp as traditional print and the contrast with the background less fatiguing on the eyes than my previous kindle i tend to be a binge reader so that makes a big difference as does the lack of a backlight the frame is far less distracting as there are no buttons or letters to draw the eye away from what you are reading despite being in black and white the pictures in my cookbooks are rendered in enough detail to be appealing its like looking at the pictures in a massmarket paperback its no coffeetable display but it gives the general ideathe user interface is invisible yet always close at hand one tap and i can navigate check references or definitions see where i am in the book and how much is left or simply check the time without leaving the page or picking up another device the gestures are intuitive if youre accustomed to a smartphone or tablet so theres no learning curve it comes already linked to your amazon account so upgrading is mostly done when you get it it took about ten minutes to open the box put it in the new case set up the wifi and download my collections and books from the cloud i appreciate not having to reorganize all my books back into their groups because it doesnt automatically download every book ive ever purchased i dont have to waste space on the device on the few duds ive happened across of course if im desperate and near wifi i can get them from the cloud nothing is gone forever realistically im unlikely to ever run out of space even if i kept everything on the device 4g holds a lot of textreading other reviews i do think some people have been unfair so im going to address some common complaints this kindle does not have a physical keyboard personally i think thats a plus there are no fiddly little keys or clicky navigational arrows you can swipe tap or slide anywhere on most of the screen and it turns the page forward touching along the left margin will flip back if you miss the keyboard that much amazon does sell laptops without the keyboard apparently there are games you cant play on this kindle for game play a better choice would be a tablet or a smartphone this is a relatively inexpensive entrylevel dedicated ereader the experimental browser is still lurking in the menu and it has great access to the kindle store but its nothing youll spend hours sailing across the net on unless youre desperateoverall this is fantastic at doing what its designed to do its the perfect alternative to yet another bookshelf,excellent purchase
1.0,i am disappointed i cant adjust the brightness of the screen like i can do on my paperwhite my own fault for not realizing this before i ordered it,i am disappointed i cant adjust the brightness of the screen 
1.0,really cheap product slow and difficult to use you have to tap it so many times before the screen registers and changes page or goes to the library wish i would have just stuck to the kindle app instead of wasting money on this hate it,cheap and slow
1.0,really not happy with this kindle it was not what i had hoped i returned and upgraded for the new fire and i am very happy with it,was not what i wanted
5.0,ive been an avid reader from the moment i first learned to read this means over the years i have collected tons of books sure ive downsize plenty of times gave books away to friends or donations but still somehow before i knew it i once again has too many books and no place to store new ones it was a vicious cycle so i as much as i was against them i decided to get an ereaderi originally had a nook color and that was my first introduction into ereaders it was great for graphic novels and comics but not so much for actual novels my eyes would hurt and strain from the back light and text i also hated reading outside on a bright sunny day since all i would experience was glare while for the most part i was happy with it i could play games on it i was also extremely unhappy eventually my nook suffered extreme water damage so i was then in the market for a new ereader i tried to save myself some money by reading on my ipad but i encountered the same problems as i did with the nook painful strained eyes from the back light when reading for prolonged times and of course the dreaded sunny day glare which those of us with ipads know that glare pretty much renders them useless since you cannot see a thing plus my ipad is a bulky 2nd generation and because of the weight it gets pretty tiring holding that thing for a lengthy time reading because of my inability to comfortably read i started buying physical books again and once again ran out of room to store themi started doing my research on some basic ereaders such as the kindle kindle paperwhite and the nook glowlight i didnt want one of the tablet ereaders since i already had an ipad so why do i need all the bells and whistles so i compared each of the ereaders i was interested in and the nook glowlight was originally winning the race since i had a whole library of ebooks purchased from barnes and noble from my previous device and the price was excellent 100 bucks for basically the bn version of the kindle paperwhite it was cheaper than buying the paperwhite from amazon but then prime day happeneda basic kindle with special offers for 50 bucks soldi had heard of the pricing when sales had leaked a few days before prime day and i told a few people i knew i was buying a kindle my husband pointed out a few things such as there is no backlight well the backlight was my main issue with my previous ereader and my ipad so no backlight no problem what about your previous barnes and noble library i already read them all ill buy new books again no problem what if you want to read in the dark i turn on a light problem solved and last but not least dont you think the special offers will get annoying nope in fact something might catch my eye and it will serve more like a recommendation on what to read next i had it all figured out i was buying a kindlethe day my kindle came i was so excited that i immediately set it up i took advantage of a trial month of kindle unlimited so i started reading right away i am beyond thrilled i made this purchase the kindle so far has lived up to my every expectation granted i have only had the device for 5 days i have no issues with my eyes hurting or straining while reading i have been able to take advantage of a breezy summer day by reading in my backyard without an issue of glare from the sun the photo ive included with my review is the clearness of the screen outside on a sunny day i was so impressed with the lack of glare i immediately took a picture with intentions of adding it to this review the weight of the kindle is practically nothing so it doesnt become annoying holding it for a prolonged reading session im also very impressed with the battery life ive been reading daily for about an hour or so each day and i havent needed to charge my kindle yet except for the initial charging when it arrived i also love the ability to use amazon household to share libraries my husband uses the kindle app on his tablet so i am able to read what he reads on my kindlei am extremely happy to have bought a kindle which originally i would have never done so if it hadnt gone on sale during prime day but i will admit that would have been so foolish because even at 79 dollars the kindle with special offers is worth every penny,one of the best purchases i have ever made
1.0,its only a reader and it doesnt do anything that i was expecting it toi was expecting it to be like my kindle fire,i was expecting it to be like my kindle fire
4.0,i purchased the new oct 2014 basic kindle i just wanted a simple ereader so that i can have all my books with me to read where ever i am the resolution doesnt seem as crisp and bright as my previous kindle touch but it gets the job done i notice that everything is now stored on the cloud and you have to transfer the books over to the device i transferred all my collections over to the device but in doing so the books remained in the cloud i had to take the added step to add the books within the collections to the device making this kindle for me rather clunky to use finally at first this new kindle felt awkward and too chunky in my hands but it fits perfectly in my old kindle touch case and now i dont mind iti have owned two kindle touches before this kindle both of them just stopped working one before the warranty ended and the second just after the warranty ended i have never dropped my kindles nor do i abuse them so i decided this time to buy the basic kindle on sale thank you black friday and when it dies then at least i will feel as if ive gotten my monies worthi am disappointed that this kindle doesnt have speakers and no longer offers the texttospeech tts feature i was going to return it to purchase the paperwhite but found it no longer offers the feature either i was so happy with all the features of my kindle touch it was such a pleasure to discover all that it did i could understand if amazon decided to make a base model that didnt have all the goodies but to redesign kindle models to take features away from us so that we have to purchase the highest priced kindle models for the tts feature just seems like amazon is adding value to some of its customers by taking from the others,does what it is supposed to but no texttospeech feature
1.0,i hate it cant make it workreturning it,i hate it
5.0,got it today as promised was not sure if i would like the touch screen kindle ive had kindle with a keyboard since 67 years the initial impression is it is really good found it easy to read and the controls are easy to use the books got synced up in minutes once i logged in now to get a cover for it,was not sure if i would like the touch screen kindle
1.0,i am ticked off that im required to get an separate light in order to make this screen brighter why couldnt they have added that feature internally only good when youre near a bright light source ridiculous not recommended,screen way too dark
1.0,i bought a kindle voyage and i absolutely hate this device it is the most userunfriendly piece of electronic equipment i have ever tried to use i will probably never use it again after having tried to read through two books on it what a waste of money,a waste on money
1.0,do not buy this 79 dollar boat anchor matter of fact it would probably float so is all around useless i dont often read just wanted something light and easy to learn to play the piano on a piano in my pocket you know well all amazon piano apps are incompatible with this amazon device sorry i wasted my money dont make the same mistake i did,so is all around useless i dont often read
2.0,i thought i ordered a 7in tablet i dont read novels and wont be using it,two stars
1.0,piece of crapnot backlit,junk
1.0,i must hold the kindle in my left hand i had a kindle keyboard which i could hold and turn the pages with my one hand i broke the screen and had to buy a new kindle and ended up with the new touchscreen kindle it is very difficult to hold and turn the pages with just the left hand sometimes it goes to the next page sometimes back a page sometimes it opens the dictionary and sometimes it highlights the text it is driving me crazy i would not recommend it to anyone who is left handed i wish i had bought an old kindle keyboard on ebay,i would not recommend it to anyone who is left handed
2.0,i have been very disappointed with my new kindle 6 glarefree e reader i loved my old one and sorry it died there are many times when it doesnt take actions as needed ie page turning scrolling up or down it will simply do nothing or to my frustration if your finger is near the page it will jump and sometimes it takes several minutes to find where you were it seems to me that in this case progress has taken a big step backwards in this new edition im not very happy and would not recommend it you need to improve this reader or remove itbobbie,this reader needs improvement
1.0,this is a joke right,fraud
1.0,i have had a kindle touch with one of those lighted leather covers for years i tend to lose things on airplanes so i like to keep a spare i was very excited to see that amazon started making the touch again because im using a refurbished one nowthis is shorter and wider than the old kindle touch it has no home button and it has no contacts at the back to power a light worst of all it looks and feels cheap the screen seems to be the same but the body is a cheap black plastici didnt bother setting it up so i dont know how well it actually works i am still trying to decide whether or not to send it back,this is a big disappointment please bring back the old kindle touch
1.0,i dont really understand the use of this thing you can read a book on this thing and literally nothing else the screen was far too dim indoors to be of practical use and there was no way of changing it i also dont see why you wouldnt just buy the book most people only read one book at a time anyway so why do i need my entire library at all times we bought this for my mom and we want to return it immediatelyi have to give amazon credit for this one they took a device with 90s technology slapped wifi on it and charge 70 for it i had a palm pilot fifteen years ago that has more functionality than this thing im not antiamazon in any way my sister has a fire hd and loves it but you are far better off buying something else even if it costs you a little more,get something else
4.0,i like the kindle i think for the price its unbeatable in quality i used it everyday and enjoyed it thoroughlyhowever if you can afford the paperwhite its worth the premium i took mine back and purchased the paperwhite and i can say i wont be going back the build quality and overall usefulness of the paperwhite is well worth the 40however if your budget does not allow it this kindle is still a favorite of mine just full light is needed and it does scratch easily,great product prefer paperwhite
1.0,very disappointed the kindle itself is easy to use and nice bought it after noticing that books i wanted to read are available on amazoncom several purchases later i received a threatning letter from amazon,very disappointed the kindle itself is easy to use and 
4.0,very nice book reader also comes with promotional unlimited reading ability to get any book from the list for a monthwhat is a bit annoying in the amazon interface is that if you click buy even mistakenly then the purchase is made without any explicit confirmation or password,very nice book reader
1.0,i dont like it i put it up,one star
1.0,i highly recommend never buying one of these i got this for christmas and about a year and 4 month later i go an error message that read kindle needs repair i called amazon and they told me the device was dead and there was nothing they can do they offered me a discount for a refurbished one which was actually more than if i just ordered a new on from their website i babied this product i had it in a hard case and only charged when the battery was very low the book stayed on my night stand 247 so it was never abused out in the world i only read about 10 books on the device i wont ever be buying one of these again since amazon wont back thier product for more than a year,poorly built product that amazon doesnt back with a good warranty
1.0,not happy with the products,one star
5.0,i have the first gen fire but this my first e ink kindle ive owned i love reading and this kindle is perfect its so light much easier to read on this than a book its not backlit but who cares neither are my physical books the software is neat i really like the built in dictionary and flash cards and the battery lasts forever i hardly use my fire anymore and when i do its not for reading this kindle is perfect ,first time kindle buyer
1.0,i just bought this kindle for 79 dollars then you put it on sale for 49 i find it hard to read dont know how to remove books from it,i just bought this kindle for 79 dollars then 
5.0,this is my first kindle but ive been using the kindle app on my samsung galaxy note ii for quite some time initially i held out on buying any kind of ereader i enjoy the feel of a paperback in my hands however i am in many lit classes and the cost of books has been piling up when this kindle went on sale for 59 i decided i could finally justify buying this nonessential item i only got it yesterday but i am so glad that i have it now the screen is crisp and clear i prefer it much more than reading on the kindle app probably because it is not back lit so it is easy on the eyes the battery seems to last forever i stayed up hours reading last night if i had been on my phone i wouldve needed to plug it into the charger long before i wanted to stop reading though page turns are smoother on the app turning pages on my kindle doesnt jar me out of my reading experience at all some people complain about a lack of buttons for page turning but i dont see the need for them since this kindle is touchscreen im already used to tapping to turn pages on the app so in this the two are exactly the same additionally i love the size its bigger than my phone but not cumbersome so its easy to read lying in bed with a bedside lamp on of course the only thing remotely negative that i can say isnt even about the kindle itself its about the need to separately purchase a power adapter dont waste your money on the official kindle adapter i purchased a universal usb power adapter for 6 that works just as well theres no need to spend 20 on it if you have a cell phone charger that uses an adapter you dont really even need to buy one at all i only did for convenience sake all in all i am extremely happy with my purchase,i enjoy the feel of a paperback in my hands
1.0,take it off the market,one star
4.0,although i love kindles in general i gave this 4 stars mainly in comparison to the other versions available i actually purchased this kindle for my son and the paperwhite for myself and i find myself now wishing that i had just purchased two paperwhites the standard kindle without advertisements is about 99 and the kindle paperwhite with advertisements was 119 but that extra 20 gets you a much improved screen and a reading light that really comes in handy the reading light is especially useful for me because i read to my son when he goes to bed my advice is to just buy the paperwhite itself and not worry about the case or charging adapter because you could buy similar items of the same quality from other makers for much cheaper than the 50 and 20 respectively with regards to whether or not to get one without the advertisements you have to pay extra to get one that is advertisementfree i normally hate advertisements but these ones are really unobtrusive because they only occur when the kindle isnt being actively used i don’t own a kindle voyage but i used a friends voyage and i didn’t see anything that really justified the extra price the screens look basically the same and the only major difference is the sensors that automatically adjust the reading light which might be important for some people but probably not so much for most users,although i love kindles in general
1.0,this sucksas soon as it turns on all it tries to do is sell you stufftheres no home pagenothing easy to useits a computerized salesman,i hate this kindle
1.0,this kindle is a replacement for my kindle keyboard which bit the dust a couple of weeks ago i loved my previous kindle model i loathe the new one with a burning hatred i find hard to contain the touchscreen is the most annoying thing ever however if youve never used a nontouchscreen kindle you may have a different opinionwith my previous kindle i could hold the device anywhere and not lose my place in the book if it slipped in my hands grabbing it anywhere was ok with this one any light touch to the screen changes something my ponytail accidentally touched it and some stupid window to change text size popped up ive lost count of the number of times it has jumped ahead several pages when i only tapped the screen oncethe reason i purchased a replacement kindle instead of using my ipad is because its smaller lighter and better on the battery but this kindle sucks i miss the buttons to change the page to go home or back or turn wifi onoff with my previous kindle i could hold it in my left hand while i ate lunch my right hand could hold a fork while my left hand could change the page not with this one you have to tap the right side of the screen to jump ahead my thumb isnt 8 long so it doesnt reach the right sideso i will take apart my old kindle to try to fix it because im this close to playing frisbee with the new one if that fails well i dont know what ill do but ill still hate the new kindle this will never change but i miss the buttons im tired of jumping through hoops for functionality that was once available with one key theres too much tapping for me,as a replacement for my kindle keyboard this one sucks
1.0,this is the worst product ive ever ordered cannot make the screen brighter to read ive not even used this so it sits in the corner the worst product ever only reason i gave it one star was because it looks cute but worthless,this is the worst product ive ever ordered
1.0,i try to buy this with 5 hours to only to understand that it was sold out in the morning what about the real people that work that time of morning and can not get on the computer that time of morning it would seem fair if you would save some sock for the afternoon customers also,not fair

5.0,i have debated getting a kindle for a long time but was never sure i wanted to give up on holding a real book and turning real pages well i finally decided to try the basic kindle and i am pleasantly surprised how much i enjoy reading on this i definitely read more now that i have the kindle its comfortable to hold there is zero eye strain and overall usability is excellent having so many cheap or free books available through kindle deals has already increased my kindle library substantially i bought a fintie folio case and they are a great fitscreen excellent clear no eye strain easy to readtouch excellent intuitive responsive turning pages happens subconsciously nowcasing good plastic but not uncomfortable maybe would have preferred a little matte finish for gripspeed responsive no lag page turns do not noticeably flash like the kindle keyboard i tried out from a friend which was distractingas a former kindle skeptic i would recommend this to anyone who isnt sure they want to give up on real paper i am very happy with my purchase,i read more now the kindle is very enjoyable
1.0,seriously i still have no idea what is happening with this,one star
4.0,this kindle reader is exactly as described we have used our kindle fire for our ebooks but it was difficult or impossible to read in bright sunlight with the new kindle reader 6 bright light is no problem even on the beach that said it does not have a back light so it can not be read without light or in low light conditions think of a hard copy of a book this unit weighs just 65 ounces outside measures 65 x 4625 screen is 475 x 35 this kindle was easy to startup and a users manual was included in the unit books that i had on the kindle fire transferred to the kindle reader this just arrived yesterday so i have not really explored all the features so i can not comment on those the only reason for the 4 star was the lack of backlighting but your books can be read in bright sunlight the attached photo was taken this morning in direct sunlight for the price this was a true bargain,great for reading in bright light
1.0,not at all satisfied thought i was buying a kindle white,not satisfied
4.0,love the smaller design had the previous keyboard kindle chose the touch because i like the long battery life of my previous one this one would have got 5 stars if 1st it had the nice screen savers like my previous one and 2nd if it had text to speech like the kindle keyboard i love reading on a kindle they are awesome devices i cried when i lost my kindle keyboard had it been my ipad i would not have been that upset,kindles are great for those who love to read 
2.0,cant read in dark in bed no backlight,no backlight
3.0,works good i do prefer the original kindle using buttons to turn pages however,i like buttons
1.0,the kindle did not have audio book capability as advertised we will be returning the product in the near future,the kindle did not have audio book capability as advertised 
5.0,on cyber monday i bought this kindle and im very happy to report how pleased i am with this easy to read ereader that very day of delivery i read a nicholas sparks book that i purchased love having a book at the touch of my fingers easy to turn pages just a swipe with your thumb the kindle is so lightweight easy to use easy and quick to download a book it came charged also which made it easy to immediately begin using i love all the handy features that it provides there is not a backlight you wont need it it has a glarefree easy on the eyes screen which is great for me reading on a computer is very hard on my eyes because of a backlight it can cause my eyes to become bothersome and dry a backlight is hard on your eyes and can also keep you from sleeping peacefully should you purchase this ereader i believe you will also be very happy and find what a well made device it is what a cyber monday deal wow,great cyber monday buy
2.0,as a tablet the kindle is absolute trash it tries to be more than an e reader which is not what i was looking for at all if you are thinking about buying a tablet just go all out and spend a little more money for a better tablet the operating system is very slow especally the keyboard which makes browseing the internet or writing anything a complete drag the layoutalso makes it very difficult to use especially with the worthless autocorrect you can also not change the home screen or lock screen photos which makes me feel as if amazon™ has loned it to me all data on this device is also collected by amazon™i just wanted a functional e reader insted i have a semi functional tablet do not buy this,absolute trash just buy a regular tablet it reads books too
3.0,i like that this kindle has a touch screen and everything except for one annoying thing works as it should sometimes without warning the text will change to a smaller or larger font without me touching the screen at all and i have to change it back irritating bug,annoying bug
1.0,i sent it back as it was horrid i have a good kindle fire that i read everyh day but this was a joke should be take off the market at amazon,i have a good kindle fire that i read everyh day but this 
5.0,its really nice to read on and very easy to use i gave it 5 stars because it works exactly as advertised but i regret not getting the one with the backlight i didnt think i would use the light that much so i figured i would save myself the money after using it and enjoying it i realized how much a light would help i have since then bought an external light for it but the all in one would have been a better choice if you are debating on this one or the one with the light i would go for the backlight version,get the backlight version
1.0,free books are bad and books are expensive,one star
1.0,i ordered the older version that has buttons and got the newer version with touch screen that may seem like a bonus to you but not to me plus i paid for postage when i bought it and then had to pay postage to pick it up at the post office that didnt make me a happy camper the reason i wanted the older generation with the buttons was because of a medical situation that just makes buttons easier it seems they are phased out and even though the device that was pictured had the needed buttons and was referred to as previous generation i still got the newer model all of the new kindles are touch screen now which means i probably wont ever buy another one good job amazon,that may seem like a bonus to you but not to me
3.0,the screen has touch aspects similar to those of the fires which are nice however the screen and the font are not as clear as my old kindle keyboard and it therefore hurts my eyes overall i was very disappointed in it i nearly returned it but kept it in case my keyboard died,rather disappointed in its screen and fonts the old kindle keyboard is easier on the eyes

5.0,i have used my 3rd generation kindle keyboard since it was launched and i recently bought this one for my brother i still use my kindle keyboard but after trying this one the old girl is now feeling a little slow and little washedout and im thinking of upgrading to the paperwhite soon i dont imagine many of you are firsttime kindle users and many may be wondering if the latest kindles are worth the upgrade i wondered the same myself and im just here to tell you that after using it im now convinced that the better refreshrate contrast blacker blacks and whiter whites and lighter weight are worth an upgradekindle units in general have changed my life for the better and i have totally forgiven amazon for losing 9k on their stock back when i was younger thank you amazon,worth an upgrade but the paperwhite may be better
1.0,i should have read the description betterno back lightperfect,one star
2.0,it really was a disappointment compared with my older kindle touch using the touchscreen to get to the menu is tricky and much of the time you get to a dictionary entry instead of the menu the menu button on the touch is much more convenient it also seems much lighter and flimsier in your hand the touch seems to be much more solid and sturdyalso there did not seem to be an option for a leather case and the new synthetic case feels cheaply made,it really was a disappointment compared with my older kindle touch
1.0,hate it,zero stars
3.0,i wish i could combine the old kindle with this touch kindle touch is good for taking notes but a hassle because the pages get turned from merely holding the kindle pretty annoying i wish you could turn the touch feature on and off just like you turn wireless on and off i already gave my mother my old kindle and she likes it so ill put up with this one for now no matter what its a kindle so you can carry one device and have hundreds of books at your fingertips and the database for free kindle books on amazon is amazing more than you could ever read in a lifetime,its a kindle i think youll like it
1.0,it sucks,one star
5.0,ive owned 2 nook ereaders over the past 5 years or so in that amount of time ive bought close to 200 ebooks a few months ago i started comparing the price of kindle ebooks with nook ebooks and ive found that kindle is usually 2 to 5 cheaper than nook and at worst the same price for the books i read i have yet to see a nook ebook cheaper than kindleas a result i felt like i was just wasting money buying ebooks from nook so on cyber monday i bought the cheaper kindle for 49 im assuming ill make up for the price of the kindle within 3 or 4 months a little at a time every time i purchase kindle ebooksa little bit of a learning curve was involved with this the nook was touch screen and this is touch screen little differences in functionality but easy enough to learn i will only be using this kindle to read books so didnt want or need any of the kindles that have more bells whistles if i need to read in bed at night or at low light i have the kindle app on my smart phonethe main reason i bought this kindle was because the kindle ebooks are cheaper but now that i have it im very pleased with it,replacing a nook
1.0,not one word game available hopefully outlasts our last 3 kindles this is my 3rd,one star
1.0,i bought the older version of this to give my daughter a gift after 15 year the half of screen was out without any reason she didnt drop nor push the screen just lower part of screen is dead and upper part is working well i asked customer service to repair it but surprisingly there is no repair option instead gowtham who answered my request offered me replacement option only to 125200 version of kindle if amazon agrees to offer replacement for the defect of the product amazon has to offer the similar product that a customer bought not trying to sell more expensive product i ended up the chatting with gowtham even though heshe was polite he couldnt help me as the policy was wrong,no replacement option for lowend version of kindle
1.0,i could not used it would not do what i need it to do so i had to return it back,i could not used it would not do what i 
5.0,ive owned about 3 kindles and i think this is probably my favorite it is simple to use and faster than the kindle keyboard or the fire i really just wanted something to be able to read ebooks on and this kindle was perfect for that i love the touch screen and how responsive it is the battery life is amazing as well it truly is a glarefree screen so i can read anywhere i think the only thing i miss on this kindle is a headphone port for audiobooks or text to speech but because books can sync across devices for the times that i want to listen to a book i just use my phone instead of the kindle this is a really lightweight device that isnt super fragile so it is easy to take it places like waiting rooms and not worry about it getting broken in my bag on the way there it doesnt require as much protective gear as a tablet either which makes it more cost effective in supplies and power consumption,and i think this is probably my favorite it is simple to use and faster than 
2.0,i was disappointed when i realized that this kindle does not have a back light because the screen is very dark and the print small the print can be enlarged however when the print is enlarged it distorts the books page i will be returning it,i was disappointed when i realized that this kindle does not have 
5.0,this device is amazing for 59 dollars it was 1000 percent worth the upgrade for me from the 3rd gen kindle this device has touchscreen which makes it a million times easier to flip pages the processor is fast there is barely any time before it loads the next page this device is worth it at 100 bucks but in march 2015 you can get it from 59 instead of 79 if your iffy about buying this device just do it i was too but i am happy with my purchase,astonishing great work again amazon
5.0,i received my kindle 6 as a gift and didnt know much about them or if i would even find much use for it boy has this device changed my life i detest reading i read only if a job or problem requires it i never made time for reading prior to owning my kindlefirst of all when i powered on my kindle it welcomed me personally and thanked me for my purchase somehow it ties to the account it was purchased with unless otherwise specified cool creepy in some ways but cool skeptical i continued to operate the device and was guided to download a couple free books with my prime membershipi purchased a couple titles on the off chance that i had some time where my internet was out or i was stranded somewhere with no cell phone service so i still had something to do a week after owning my kindle we had a tornado watch in which my family gathers in a safe spot until the watch downgrades to a warning all my mobile devices were occupied by other family members waiting patiently for the storm to pass so i picked up my kindle and began to explorei began reading and immediately paid attention to the line numbers page numbers percent completed and estimated time remaining cool i activated wordwise which identifies key words sentences characters and events and gives me a brief summary when i go a few days without reading wordwise can quickly remind me where im at in the story neat kindle also never loses my place whether reading on kindle my iphone ipad or desktop pc thats convenient lastly i can store hundreds of books on my kindle and infinitely more in the cloud so theres no bulk besides the device itself no clutterive now added several more books to my amazon wishlist and will wait for them to go on sale but my reading habits have changed and its all thanks to kindle kindle makes reading enjoyable in an increasingly digital world,kindle makes reading enjoyable in an increasingly digital world
5.0,i have now had this item for well over a year and after having experimented with several generations of kindles including the 1st generation kindle released by amazon i have to say that this remains my favorite item and the newer generations have not been tempting at all the main difference is that this kindle reads just like any paperback or hardback book that you might purchase at a store for pleasure study or work there is absolutely not glare so you can read your media in any circumstance that you might have to endure it is also easy to use and the pages turn with a flick of a finger the only thing i wish that was different on this item is the plastic shell as it is quite easy to scratch i do recommend purchasing a protection case for any of your kindle products,after having owned several generations of kindle this particular one remains my favorite
1.0,this thing is a joke its darker than an actual paper book even in full sunlight or with a reading light it hurt my eyes mine also had a weird glitch where anytime you touched the screen to turn a page etc a circular halo flickered across as did thewords dont waste your time or money on this spend the extra 40 and get the paperwhite,dont waste your time buy the paperwhite instead

2.0,i returned this item because of a single major flaw pdf rendering its great for everything elsei use lots of pdf books and a lot of them are scanned books with pages in the jbig2 compression algorithm this is the best bw image compression routine ever invented you can have a 300dpi book 6x9 pages 400 pages all in maybe a 7mb file size its awesomebut kindle cant properly render jbig2 compressed pdfs its like someone went through the book and randomly erased characters like to the tune of half a dozen characters from every page just gone for e ample im gine h w hard it wo ld be to re d somethi g with lots of mi sing chara tersive used these same pdfs with dozens of other devices and software packages and they always show perfectly except on kindle seems to be a universal problem with kindle pdf rendering engine because ive seen the same thing in multiple kindle eink devices and even on a friends kindle firei know this is a very specialized problem and probably wont affect a lot of people at all but if you need good pdf supportprobably ought to look elsewhere,its great for everything else
1.0,why would anyone make an ereader without a backlight people only read during the daytime are we still in 1896 come on amazon shame on you for making this useless product,dont buy this
5.0,i love carrying this lightweight kindle and reading books i have a kindle fire but it is so much heavier that is the reason that i ordered this i have so many books in it to read and yet it is lighter than carrying a paperback book,i love carrying this lightweight kindle and reading books
1.0,this kindle is horrible the 3g doesnt work and it expects to take credit cards and not gift cards i dont want amazon to even know my credit card number at all gift card is all this company will ever get as a source of payment from me i regret everything i dont want this piece of junk why why only credit cards why cant i use gift cards without having to plug in a credit card number why im not going to use this anytime soon,this kindle is horrible the 3g doesnt work
2.0,touch screen feature is unnecessary and problematic and lacks a hold feature which would remedy the situationi had a kindle keyboard for years and loved reading on it but unfortunately for the touch screen and minimal nontouch sensitive space on the kindle touchscreen leaves you with little place to hold it i consider my hands medium to smaller there should be plenty of room on this thing to hold it but there simply isnt meaning your hand has to hold smaller space and can cramp upthe kindle keyboard was great because you could hold the kindle and if your thumb rested on the page it wouldnt affect the experience and even though the physical keyboard was hardly ever used it gave you more space to hold the devicehonestly the problem could be fixed with a hold feature if you remember ipods and cd players they had a switch that when turned on made it so buttons were unresponsive so if they were inadvertently pushed it didnt affect the experience if the kindle either had a physical switch or a mode from the software that made the kindle unresponsive until the power button or a specific corner of the screen was touched it would completely fix the experiencebut sadly the kindle touch screen lacks this feature leaving me missing the discontinued kindle keyboard,touch screen feature is unnecessary and problematic

5.0,i love this kindle i also own afire hdx 89 but i wanted a plain kindle for just reading this feels much lighter than my hdx and it is thinneri am having trouble getting used to the feel of it in my hand but i will eventually i wanted to write this review because i am a person with dyslexia and i love that i can change the font and size of the print to accommodate those bayesian having more difficulty reading this model comes with the futura font which is easiest for me to read i wish that all kindles and fires offered all fonts i can not get this font on the hdx yet i have talked to customer service and it may be in an update but i dont understand why all the fonts arent universal to all kindlesanyway i love this kindle yes you need a lighted area to read in and you need wifi to download material if you do not have wifi yourself go to your local library or a mcdonalds i did that with my first reader and that kept me going for 2 years once i needed internet for college i invested in wifi as someone else mentioned this is a great introductory kindle i got mine during the black friday sales and it was under 70 dollars if you want a beginning reader for your children you may want to get the kindle he 6 if your child is past picture books then this kindle is for you compare before you buy and you wont be disappointed,great little ereader want a light use a lamp

3.0,i am having a bit of a problem learning how to use it i have to keep going back to the guide to see how to get where i want to get with my previous kindle the buttons are right there i am sure my age 76 has something to do with it perhaps after i have used it awhile it will get easier i am not in to touch screens much yet,i am having a bit of a problem learning how 
5.0,i bought this one to replace the 4year old one that finally died the screen size is the same but they changed to dimensions of the outer frame just enough i couldnt use the protective case from the old one there are a couple of minor differences in the controls but otherwise much the same,7th generation kindle
5.0,i bought this to replace my broken 4th gen kindle after having dropped itoops and i couldnt be more happyaside from the battery life being somewhat less than is advertisedwhich is to be expected for a several hours a day reader like myself this kindle exceeds my expectations i feel that the eink display is clearer than the previous generations the processor is faster making for smoother page transitions and faster searchesthe added feature of kindle free time is unnecessary for me as i am the only user but a nice addition and will be nice when we order one for our children to share when they get to be reading agei love the time remaining in chapterbook feature its helpful to know when the chapter will end so i know how long i have so i have a set time i can set the kindle down to cook dinner or go to bed since im an addicted reader that doesnt like to put a book down until ive reached a good stopping point,and i couldnt be more happy aside from the battery life being somewhat less 
3.0,im not impressed ive spent the better part of three hours trying to set this up as a gift for my roommate all i can say is thank goodness im the one setting it up and not her if she had to go thru all of this hassle she would have asked me to return it definitely not what i expected am sorely disappointed,not worth the cost
5.0,i love it i read fast and enjoy having the full control of size font alignment how i like to read my letters just speeds up the reading time the fast access to dictionary is amazingly beneficial for easier faster learning i only regret not buying it sooner,too much greatness for the price

5.0,i am really enjoying my kindle i already had a kindle fire hd however it strained my eyes too much to read at night the size is perfect to carry around with me and i have to be honest here im a big star trek geek and the kindle reader reminds of the padd device on that show,best ereader in the galaxy
1.0,too hard to use bought cover didnt fit,too hard to use bought cover didnt fit
3.0,i was really looking forward to the touch screen but its ended up being really annoying i like to read holding the kindle one handed but even holding it with both hands or even holding it in one hand and using the index finger of the other hand the most careful way to tap the touch screen when i tap the right side to advance a page it often jumps forward several pages and it is incredibly annoying to have to page back to the page i was trying to get to in the first place jerks me right out of the book its annoying enough that i wish id kept my old non touch screen kindle it seems to be confined to page turning so when i need to use the on screen keyboard it works great and thats the reason i upgraded still having a hard to use keyboard is much preferable to this jump ahead several pages thing oh well live and learn,touch screen is touchy even a very careful tap can have it advancing several pages instead of just 1 when trying to turn pages
1.0,does not work as expected will return,one star
4.0,i took advantage of the trade in program to get the extra 25 toward a new kindle i boxed up my old one and sent it off to amazon after they accepted it i ordered the new touch screen modelwhy an eink reader well i travel a lot for work and like to read i already stare at lcd screens all day so the eink is softer on my eyes why kindle well no matter how you look at it the amazon ecosystem is top notchso how does the latest version stack up first off the software is touch friendly and a little easier to get around you can long press a word to get a definition instead of navigating to it via a button you can press the top of the screen to get back to your home screen and choose a new reading material want to read a book just tap it to open it turn a page tap it and give a little swipe in the direction you want to go swipe it left to go to the next page right go back to a previous page it works pretty well and seems very snappy i would argue that the screen is not as sensitive as a phone or ipad but that is a good thingsee the touch can get in the way at times i have accidentally turned the more than i ever did on my old kindle i would almost be in favor of a hardware button to accomplish this kind of annoying but i can live with it my other issue deals with the sleep wake button it is on the bottom of the device and i have accidentally hit that a few times while reading i wish that while in a book amazon would use the button to trigger a dialog box that popped up asking if that was an accident or if you really wanted to send the device into sleepoverall i am impressed i like the reader the screen is sharp and responsive the touch screen can be both an upgrade and an annoyance but overall i prefer it i am glad i updated,i travel a lot for work and like to read
2.0,not enough back lighting on screen,two stars
5.0,when i saw that this had gone on sale i had to buy it i bought this device for 59 with special offers which is an amazing price this device is amazing and is far better than my old kindle keyboard this device has a touchscreen which i was not happy about at first it turned out to be the best feature of this device after reading of course the touchscreen uses infrared which made the screen very sensitive sometimes too sensitive it is pretty good though and has no input lag except for the epaper display it makes navigation so much easier than on the kindle keyboard the screen quality is pretty good too it never glares and i can read it in direct sunlight the screen quality is decent as well you can see books and even read large pdfs it just works this device is fast and never seems to slow down it opens books fast it opens the kindle store fast and it also opens goodreads fast the kindle store has the most ebooks of any online store the booksmagazines are affordable and download quickly when you open a book on the device you can change the margins font size and the font style the reading experience is quite nice it feels like i am reading a very light and thin book it does not hurt your eyes like an lcd on a smartphone or tablet it is just like reading a book off of the real paper the goodreads integration is great and i like to use it a lot it is good for writing reviews right on the kindle after finishing the book also​ it is good for reading other peoples reviews and suggestions you can even set what book you reading at the time the keyboard contributes to both the kindle store and goodreads the keyboard i think is even better than the kindle keyboard it is fast and responsive other than the screen and can take actions quickly it also pops up fast as well this is the best thing i have ever read on it is even better than a normal book because it is so light and thin i did not talk about some of the features because i do not personally use them in conclusion this is a great device for reading and i would recommend it to anyone even compared to other ereaders,best reading device ever
3.0,when my trusty kindle iii keyboard finally seemed to be giving up the ghost i finally decided to upgrade i almost wish id bought a rebuilt kindle iii the new versions okay but im not that crazy about the touchscreen feature too often ill try to flick off a crumb or something and find myself on a different page my cat even changed pages when she flicked her tail at the screen and hit it just right my major complaint however is that i can no longer listen to books unless they have whispersync and i can only get that where theres wifi that means unless i buy the audio version i cant listen to the book ive been reading while i drive or when im doing volunteer work at the va those spots are about as cold as you get the voice on my old kindle was rather robotic and pronounced words strangely sometimes but it worked i was able to listen to books in the basement of the va while my arms were in a warmsand treatment for carpal tunnel and arthritis whispersync doesnt work down there and reaching the screen with my nose isnt all that great when i want to change the pagethe unit is also smaller than my old one and is not made to fit into the same case im sure thats amazons way of selling more cases but i cant afford one overall i wish my old one worked better it seems as though every time someone upgrades technology they make it worse not better,not as good as its predecessor
2.0,this kindle the socalled new and improved is a huge step backwards for me from the older kindle i had with the touch buttons at the bottom with that one it was super easy to navigate with the older one when i was finished reading a book i simply sent it to the archieves by pressing a button it didnt clutter up the main screen where i kept the lsit of unread books and when i bought a new book it showed up only on my main screen and at the top of the list and if i wanted to delete a book for good and not keep it either on the main screen or in archieves that was easily accomplished by pushing a couple of buttonsnone of that is easily done on the new and disimproved model firsts and foremost complaint there are no written instrucitons what good is it to have instrucitons buried somewhere in your new device without any instrucitons on how to access the instrucitons amazon quite sending out owners manuels because that costs them a little money to have it printed outi on paper so they save a little on each sale by not doing that but it makes it so much harder to try and learn how to operate the new kindle without having the instrucitons at your side to help you so now i will have to go to amazon and buy one i can not delete a book except to hook up the thing to my computer and try to delete it from there i can not seem to switch a read book out of the books queue to the cloud so the books on book list just keeps growingi could go on and on with complaints but it is so badhow bad is it i have stopped even trying to use it and have gone to a different ereader instead too bad amazon too bad kindle it was great while it lasted but nooooooooo you had to go and really mess up a easy to understand easy to use perfectly good device and really screw it up with your socalled disimprovementswsign mevery dissatisfied,the 6 glarefree touichscreen kindle is a huge step backwards
5.0,this is my fifth kindle all the others died of a shattered screen except my first generation and my kindle fire hd my first generation kindle is simply so hard to handle and use compared to later models that it spends most of its time in the closet most of my other kindles were the keyboard type model d00901 i loved them but the screens were too fragile and the fourway navigation switch was so tiny that i needed a special tool to use it so for my fourth kindle i got a kindle fire hdmy kindle fire is an amazing device but it has several drawbacks the worst drawback is that the moment i step outdoors the screen goes dim and the faint image that remains is totally lost in the glare from the very shiny screen i have a handicap that prevents me from driving so i travel a lot by bus which means that i spend a lot of time waiting at bus stops i like to carry a kindle with me to read while waiting so i need one that works outdoors it just happens that a local store happened to have a used touch screen kindle on sale at a very low priceas other commenters have said it came without a wall plug adapter but this was no problem since i still had the adapters from the old broken kindles as well as the adapter from my kindle fire hd all of these are usable on my touchscreen except for the first generation in addition my local supermarket carries a pack of various usb connectors and an adapter that works just as well so i didnt have to send for an amazon adaptergoing from a keyboard to touch screen did take some learning time and i am still learning some things luckily this kindle unlike the kindle fire comes with a complete and easy to read users guide the more i use the touchscreen the more assured i am that i will never go back to the keyboardyou will need a couple accessories if you want to keep your screen clean and free of fingerprints you need a stylus basically this appears to be an aluminum tube with a soft rubber tip on one end and a pocket clip on the other unlike your fingers the rubber does not generate skin oils and is easy to wipe clean of any dirt it may pick up also since the point of the stylus is much smaller than your fingertip it is much more accurate i was able to order a pack of about twenty of these for a couple bucks from an auction site in china which gave me plenty to share with friends and still have lots of sparesthe one absolutely necessary accessary is a cover your kindle is a fragile device and needs to be protected from rough handling weather and the other things in your purse there are many different kinds of covers available online and at local electronic stores first pick one that fits your model of kindle different models of kindle have onoff volume control and wireless switches in different places the wrong cover may prevent access to these switches second pick one that is very sturdy mine came with a neoprene bag which offered some protection from shock but did nothing against bending stress bending stress is a main cause of shattered screens and a shattered screen turns your kindle into a very expensive piece of trash the stronger your case the safer your kindle is so get the best cover you can affordmy touch screen kindle is the best ive ever owned for a person buying their first kindle or a person who wants a handy go everywhere reading device look no farther the only improvement that i would like to see is to make one with a seven or eight inch screen i am a fast reader and would like one where i do not have to turn the page so often,model d00901 i loved them but the screens were too fragile
5.0,you read you need a kindle there is nothing like a kindle for reading i have own every kindle there is and have tried every other reader around my choice for reading is the plain and simple kindle yes i like the paper white and the fancy voyage for the back light and higher resolution but there is something special in the plain kindle 6 it just feels and reads more like a book,there is nothing like a plain kindle 6 for reading
5.0,i got this thing as a refurb and its basically brand new i can see nothing that would suggest much use for sure no problems with the screen as of now and the touch mechanism to me is working perfectly updating the thing was a breeze so lets get into detail on the devicethe normal kindle i suppose is the poor mans ereader at this point in amazons lineup but i am waiting until the 16nm tablet revolution to get one of their highend tablets i didnt want to pay more than i needed for something that i just read text on and the paperwhite seems to have its fair share of screen problems this one was only 64 dollars base price i got a used case to go along with itfor that price the device is positively charming its my first kindle and i really could not ask for more amazons software if very mature at this point so you have a variety of fonts readability settings and core attributes to modify to your liking after a couple minor fixes for my own personal use i was off downloading my entire kindle on pc library easy fast i could not ask for anything easier the experimental browser also gets the job done bookmarks and decent website compatibility as long as it doesnt use too much flash or java the device works perfectly for a college accessory and textbook device when needednot all textbooks are compatible with the lower end devices though that was the only downside to the cheapest one in the lineup my glossary of literary terms was sadly not okay with this ereadernavigating and using features like highlights xray dictionaries and the page functions took about 20 minutes for me to get the hang of it all again everything is set up to help the customer get up and running very easily the various swipes are easy to remember and incredibly intuitive at this point i can flip preview cancel and just all around enjoy the book i am reading without hardly any hassle at all i for one did not think the page turning was too sensitive on mine seems about right for such a device amazon clearly has some very mature software here that complements the kindle hardware in synergistic fashioni dont use too many of the community features like goodreads but that is there for you too if you want to be involved in the gigantic kindle community other great community functions that are less pervasive include notes on what people highlighted in the book which i found to be a nice feature and then you have other functions like about the book which gives you some really nice info about what you are reading the first timethe one thing some people are going to not like is probably the storage 4gbs is not really what i call enough space for the future luckily i do have a lot of delphi collections and my books fit on here nicely at this point i have about 23gbs left after dling 70 or so products amazon itself has its own helpful user guide for you to dl right off the bat so if you do ever get lost that thing should save you a lot of timethe resolution of the display seems fine to me and very close to what you would get in a normal sized book the somewhat dim display works very well for and is basically about the brightness of a normal literature page i was comparing it to a bunch of my books and came away quite pleased with what they have here of course a bit more resolution would be nice but for what is here you can still get fairly small fonts and good detail this is not a reader for the dark obviouslyanyway i dont think there is too much else to say ill update the review as i go along and take a note on battery life but for now this thing is a great little device cheap fast easy to use and all around a nice product to own with good and simple build quality it syncd up with my amazon account right away and there was absolutely zero trouble getting this thing to work correctly highly recommended to those on a budget or to those that do not have any need for the higherend tablets and readers unlike some of the other products this one doesnt have any inherent screen issues either,a nifty device
4.0,this is my fifth or sixth kindle over the years while i am a bit oldfashioned and love having a good old paper book this kindle works for me life changes for us all and mine is no exception we downsized from a goodsized home in the suburbs to an apartment in the city gone is the luxury of having an extra room to serve as an office and libraryi feel lost if im traveling without something to read there always seems to be some sort of delay whether waiting for a plane or train or just the doctor having a book handy is always the perfect remedy having a kindle is even better because its quick and easy to switch to something that i feel like reading at that particular momenti have had a couple of the other glare free or paper white kindles and have always loved them they all met their end due to serious use and ultimately something dumb on my end from pushing on a pen hard enough on my leather case to damage the screen underneath to an unexpected swim in the toilet ive broken a few the second to last found me buying the kindle fire sure the web browsing colorful and glass ugh screen were nice the biggest drawback was the battery that just didnt last and would run out when i wanted to read something the most did i mention i break things yup that one still worksif you can see through the cracks in the glassi finally wised up and got what i realized i needed a lightweight basic reader that holds all my content and the battery seems to last forever its not pretty and sometimes it gets a little tricky to change pages as the swipe isnt as crisp as the others i have had still there is no glare like the fire can have on sunny days its small yet easy to read with or without reading glasses as the font is adjustable i use a light leather cover and its held up very well even to my standardsif you are looking for all the bells and whistles keep looking if you are looking for a portable easy to use and see companion for your everyday travels and dont want to worry about your battery crapping out then this model is something youll appreciate great functional tool for the job,lightweight no nonsense reader for a practical guy

1.0,after using this for over a month ive come to hold the opinion that the older kindle models were much better i like to write notes lists etc while i read and now that amazon has disabled active content i have to keep pen and paper near at hand i also like to read outside or rather i used to the touchscreen can be triggered by flies so when i set my kindle down for a minute i often find ive lost my place because a fly had landed on the screen there are a few other quirks that are mildly annoying on the positive side the battery life is good i wouldnt waste your money on this device youd be better off buying a cheap android tablet and running the kindle app on itupdate the update issued in early 2016 has made the device defective after 1 hour 46 minutes with support they acknowledged the defect and i was told there was nothing they could do basically the made my device defective then refused to repair or replace it this company seems to have shifted from caring about whether or not you were satisfied with your purchase to getting every last penny they can out of you,i much prefer the older models
4.0,i love it however i wish the screen was bigger i couldnt find a glare free version with a bigger screeni love my kindle if i forget to take the hard copy of lecture notes with me to school i know i have my kindle with me id send the pdf version to my kindle,i wont panic if i forget my notes
2.0,not user friendly like the kindle keybad version you have to scroll through a long user guide to find a topic it is not intuitive at all like how to get the desired icon to show like how to make it appear by swiping i need to work with it more to see if i can understand but may return itit would be nice if i could get a hard copy version of the user guide,not user friendly like the kindle keybad version
2.0,this was my first kindle purchase and i ended up returning it after a twoweek trial period heres why 1 yes i am one of those people who was disappointed that there was no brightness control i found the screen far too dim much of the time no matter what font i chose 2 for me the interface was awkward and not enjoyable to use it simply didnt have the intuitive feel of other devices im used to 3 perhaps most importantly i dont consider the 79 price to be cheap as many other reviewers find it especially when the kindle fire hd 6 is only 20 more and offers tons more functionality for what it does and what it doesnt do 79 is no bargain if it were offered at half that price i might consider it though even then the lack of brightness control would probably be a dealbreaker,too little product for too much money
5.0,i bought this kindle for myself and it is a great reading tool that makes my life much easier usually i used my ipad to read some ebooks but this kindle is better for reading unlike my ipad i do not have to worry about running down my battery after hours of reading its also good and easy on my eyes since the device has the same brightness with everything else so no adjustments of eyes are needed more importantly i love word wise which automatically shows simple definitions above difficult words so i do not have to check the dictionary overall it is a light easy to use and convenient reading device for everyone,a great reading device that makes my life easier
3.0,im disappointed that ive lost my bookmarks and highlights on the 300 or so books that i had on my old kindle as well as syncing to furtherest point read this device would be fine for someone just starting out with a kindle but frustrating for an existing user at this point im reading new books on the new device and im reading my older books on my old kindle there may be a way of fixing my problem with bookmarks etc but if so it doesnt happen automatically i do like that its lighter than my old kindle,disappointing
5.0,heres a short reviewloving to read on a device is what the kindle is meant to dotexture the kindle 6 has a roughsmooth back finish and smooth all around the front and reading on this device is one of the most practical things i can do on my free time as it offers glare free screen it doesnt strain my eyes and i can pull it out of my pocket anytime i would like to readfeatures the home interface is simple and choosing one of my books is as easy as pressing and tapping my favorite feature of the kindle is that it has a dictionary i can check for words i do not understand but it only works when it is connected to the wifi networkdurability ive dropped the kindle once the day after i got it and it just bounced and it landed without scratches or dents i believe its made of high quality plastic that can absorb shockcon the speed at which a page loads when you flip a page is not as snappy as you would have on a smartphone thats the only minor problems this has but i guess it wouldnt be considered a problem to everyone else,small and compact
2.0,i like the touch screen but in all honesty would give it up in a heartbeat for the battery life these used to have i went from charging my old one once a month to charging this one almost every day i dont expect it to last more than a year because rechargeable batteries have a limit how many time they can be charged most of them 500 times when the battery is gone i will probably switch to reading on the kindle app on my phone to be honest i dont even use this that much and the wifi is never on unless i am downloading something i dont suspect that this would even last an hour between charge for most people,touch screen is nicebattery life is horrible
5.0,my dad has always has a passion for reading due to macular degeneration he is losing his sight and gave up on reading i thought why not try a kindle i was afraid it would be to techy for him and since he lives in another state i wouldnt be able to assist him well he loves it he reads one to two books a day i know because his kindle is linked to my account so i have been paying for them i dont have the heart to tell him so i will continue to pay for them he did pay for all my books while i was growing up and i got my love for books from him so is a small price to pay if you have someone in your life with low vision try a kindle my dad calls at least once a week to thank me and its been six months,he did pay for all my books while i was growing up and i got my love for books from him so is a small price 
3.0, pros 1 since the kindle paperwhite is only a fraction of an inch smaller than this kindle then this product can fit into a paperwhite case as long as its not a snapin case which is really handy because its almost impossible to find cases for this one see con 1 its a bit snug and the auto onoff wont work because the paperwhite mechanism is different but at least it fits amazon itself has made cases that fit this kindle but as far as i know theres only about 62 pretty much everything advertised3 i can go on my library website and borrow kindle books for free works so easily and ive used it several times just get a library card from your local or main branch and find your library on overdrivecom at least thats the site my library is on just ask a librarian if yours is different cons 1 like i mentioned before its almost impossible to find a case specifically for this kindle why because its only called kindle and all the other kindle models whether it be fire paper white voyage touch or another are also called kindle all these models especially fire which is also in its 7th generation are significantly more popular than this very good though rather badly titled model therefore it is impossible to find the very few accessories for this kindle while they drown helplessly amid the several hundred results for the kindle anythingelsebutthisone  like i mentioned its a very good product its just fallen victim of a rather obvious but still painfully detrimental marketing misstep2 it glitches every once in a while if i try to push too many buttons and then i loose info like how many ages i read in freetime that day but thats pretty rare3 the battery only lasts weeks if you keep it on airplane mode which is usually fine because it really only uses internet when youre shopping6 month updatecon 2 is becoming a bit more prevalent what does the glitch look like well the kindle stops responding without for a few seconds i usually notice when i go to turn a page and nothing happens a moment later the screen spasms in a display of blackandwhite rectangles before going white another moment and i see the loading up screen which is a picture of a boy sitting under a tree with a progress bar in the foreground after about 1020 seconds everything is normal except for the fact that its forgotten my page number and has returned me to the spot i left off the day beforemy kindle glitches several times a week i use it every day and it almost invariably looses my place in whatever book im reading its not that big of a deal to find my place again but it is a bit disappointing,great product with one rather sad marketing error

1.0,do not buy this kindlethis is a basic model the screen is a light brown and you can not brighten the screen it also blinks to black every time you turn a page the touch screen is not user friendly and a customer service rep even told me that this was the base model and the fire is cheaper a better product and has more features do not waste your money on buying this kindle,do not waste your money
1.0,hate it,one star
2.0,i have been a happy amazon customer for over a decade with a purchase history of six kindles for myself and family but this touchscreen display kindle is not in any way an upgrade from the previous version with buttons on the consolefirst the kindle will for no reason whatsoever simply change the font size usually from my preferred third smallest to the largest or occasionally again for no reason whatsoever to the absolute smallest its a piamore an obstruction however is the sensitivity of the touchscreen you can touch the right hand portion of the screen with your finger in order to advance to the next page but if your finger hovers a second over the screen it will quickly advance numerous pages as much as 1020 pages which makes determining where the hell you were immensely difficult i am in the habit of reading my daily new york times on the kindle and this causes perennial problemsanother troubling aspect with sensitivity is how by just holding the kindle if your thumb or a finger touches the screen you change the page or call up some featurethe touchscreen is such a problem that i have considered buying a used older version that no longer is offered new but the battery would be so old that battery life would likely be almost nonexistent i know that you can buy replacement batteries but that is a lot of work just to get a decent previous version of a kindle because the newer version is substandardamazon you arent apple i wont be buying your technology if its introduced faulty from the getgo especially when i can use other readers to do what the kindle doesi am leaving this review with two stars not because i am pleased with the reader which i have had for two months but because i am managing to still use it despite the impracticalities although i will buy either a new nonamazon replacement or an amazon working upgrade sooncaveat emptor,trouble in the kindle paradise
4.0,i give the reader four stars only because i give five stars only for a product that is truly outstanding this kindle reader is very goodbut not outstanding that said it delivers for the price previously i bought the kindle voyage and own both an ipad and an android tablet without going into detail each has a use for me except for the old ipad i felt i needed reader but did not feel like paying the price of another kindle voyage this kindle gives value for the price a feature i like about both the kindle and the kindle voyage is their size i can stuff them into the pockets of just about any of my trousers just as i used to do with my soft back books as a kid and pull them out at any time navigating them is easy however i have to say that i find my android tablet much more functional in this regard but one must keep in mind this is a reader not a tablet one needs ambient light to read not with the voyage though but cannot surf the net or take or download pictures as one does with a tablet on the other hand the kindle sips energy i am a voracious reader so i had to charge my tablet daily not the kindle reader i can drag the thing with me wherever i go and pull it out anytime anywhere confident that i will be able to tune out and read i admit i do bang it around did the same thing with my books as a kid still i did not buy the cover as i did with the voyage i wanted to cut down on its weight this has proven to be a good call at first glance the screen seems miniscule but after use one finds it quite sufficient the font can be modified as well as the size of the print to my delight the kindle also has the dictionary function that i used so much in my voyage and tablet i would recommend the old kindle as an everyday knockabout reader to anyone,the kindle delivers for the price
1.0,have not gotten to use it yet after seeing 6 chapters on how to use it and couldnt remember all it said was too much to begin with next i hate touch screen items i tried to find a 5th generation no luck except used ones no thanks and i really hate it when something works well and someone leaves it for something they think is better i liked using the buttons and page turners was easier to go back too sometimes u have to touch the page several times to do what u wanted it to only got it because i had just gotten many books added and i sure would appreciate gotten to read them on my old kindle i dont like the offer sections on it and next time wont add but maybe a book at a time if i ever get this one totally set up so i can get into my library to download things uggh,wish i hadnt ordered so many books before mine went out
1.0,i wanted to love the kindle i really did i am a book restorer so i did not go into this lightly i spent hours researching the pros and cons of ereaders comparing various ereaders etc amazon happened to be offering a monthly payment plan so that kind of sealed the deal for me a little over 10 a month until it was paid off excellent totally manageable and at first the kindle was wonderful i took it with me everywhere i got a sturdy case and took good care of it but it was my constant companionthen a few months after i purchased it just after i finished paying it off it broke i went through the troubleshooting process and the rep determined i needed a new one no problem these things happen i get a new one almost immediately and ship the old one backthen another few months later it breaks again this kindle sat on my bookshelf unless i was reading it because i was so scared it would break like the last one what is the point of a kindle if you have to leave it on the shelf and never take it out of the housein under a year i have had two kindles break i have spent the past few hours chatting with different reps trying to find a solution to this problem and i just got apologies and a small credit to my account while appreciated it doesnt do much actually i was promised a certain dollar amount for my credit and have received only half of what was promised my warranty expires in 8 days and then when this next kindle they are sending me inevitably breaks from the extreme wear and tear it gets on my shelf i will be left to either buy a new one or forget the kindle entirelyhonestly the nook is looking really good right now,i wanted to love the kindle

3.0,no flip page buttons no options for orientation no charger no support for active content lower quality finish a good value only at 49 during black fridaythe touch screen is ok although is easier to skip pages unintentionally easier to use the onscreen keyboard with touch than with the joystick of the previous versiondifferent dimension then the previous version so a new cover is required not from amazon though they are charging nearly as much for the cover as for the device and the same goes for the chargerspeaking of dimensions it is a bit shorter and much thicker feels quite chunky lower quality finish the rubberized back is gone edges are barely roundedstill beats anything else in bright light so try to get it on sale,less features higher price buy it only on sale 49 is about right for it
1.0,i bought it for my grand daughter and there is no back light on device i have a paper white myself and assumed this one had a back light i was on the phone with tech support for 1 hr and 31 minutes i had to demand a supervisor after and hour of not understanding the women that was supposedly helping me the supervisor was very helpful and was the one to finally figure out the back light issue i have to ask amazon why would you have an ereader with out a back light,no backlight
4.0,i have had this kindle for a few weeks now i have grown to appreciate it for what it is what i mean by that is this device met most of my expectations but i have found that i may have had unrealistic expectations i had expected that it would have the capability to display books in color it never occurred to me that a device made in this day and age would have a black and white only display this is not a complaint as such just headsup for others who might not have considered this i reread the description of this device on amazon and did not find any reference to it being black and white only i could have missed it or they may have rectified it by nowit is however fantastically suited for textbased book reading which is of course its primary function the fonts are a little chunky when viewed up close but resolve themselves very nicely when viewed at normal reading distance if the font size is increased slightly it becomes very comfortable for my mature eyes to read it is useful even on lowlight situations it is easily much more legible than a book for reading in any given situation it is much more comfortable to hold than most books i find myself overbending the spine on my paperbacks so that i can clearly read the print that is near the foldthe experimental browser has worked moderately well for basic internet browsing but is of course also hobbled by the fact that the device is only black and whitei paid 20 for the adfree version but received the one with ads i contacted amazon and got an almost instant reply with an offer to refund the 20 or send me another i opted for the 20 refund and am glad i did the ads dont bother me at all and if i truly dont want to see them i can turn it off i would almost say it is an advantage to have the advertising because it gives me ideas on what to read nextas a side note i will post a picture that fans of the hitchhikers guide will appreciate as soon as i finish my current project ,the facts as i see them in black and white
1.0,hey amazon im just letting you know that i almost bought this kindle tonight until i found out what special offers means so i will pay you to send me advertisements thanks but no thanks,special offers
5.0,this is a really neat device but is way more complicated than the older versions it is not totally obvious how it works and the directions are too long and complicated also i think that it is ridiculous that the plug is not included you have yo buy it that is crazy but i do have a spare very small and light may be a little too small although the screen side is the same i think what is upsetting is every time you have to get a different kindle the size changes so you cannot use your previous cover,this is a really neat device but is way more

3.0,this is my second kindle touch i lost my original one which was a first or second generation model i was disappointed when i received the new one the exterior has a cheap feel to it and it lacks some of the features my first one had like the ability to store and play mp3s and having a texttospeech feature that allowed it to read to you usually the later versions of kindles improve on the earlier versions this one went backwards,i was disappointed when i received the new one the exterior

5.0,the digital age of book reading has been great for me a voracious reader since the age of seven to be able to find download and begin to read a book within a matter of minutes is nothing short of amazing when it happened i could not make the switch from paper books to the digital variety fast enoughi purchased my first kindle years ago while i enjoyed reading books on it the screen left much to be desired amazon’s early kindle operating system was faulty in that it didn’t always recognize input when touching the screen the new version for 2014 has rectified many of those issues while maintaining its very small form factor but it has not all together eliminated the touchy os problems there is still a notable lag when pressing a button onscreen and there is also a delay in showing text while typing on the virtual keyboard none of these or other minor flaws takes away from how great the kindle isimg5325the latest kindle sports a 6inch nonglare screen in a very thin small formfactor that is perfect for people who dislike bulky tablets it has wifi plus a 20 faster processor than the kindle from 2013 a speedier processor means pages are redrawn faster on screen giving an even more “like a book” feel to the kindleimg5326the kindle on top of the ipad air 2 for size comparisonthe improved battery lasts and lasts and lasts from the time i started testing this kindle to when i needed to plug it in for a charge was almost two weeks two weeks amazingit is however not easy for me to recommend the standard kindle priced at 79 when you can move up to a kindle paperwhite for less than twice the price the kindlepaperwhite has a backlit or glowing screen meaning you can read it in a dark area not so with this basic kindle review unit which needs exterior illuminationpagea great kindle feature is that all your books can stay on the same page no matter if you are using kindle hardware or a kindle reader app on your ipad iphone etcwhile the text is not as crisp as i would like it is still easier to read longform than on a tablet thanks to the eink display i get eye strain from looking at my ipad for long periods of time but never with the kindlein the context of contemporary devices that do everything it’s nice to have a purpose built kindle that is designed to do one thing and do it very well let you read the kindle family has seen many changes over the years and keeps getting better and better for the price the kindle is an easy choice to buy if you use amazon and are a prime member there really is no excuse not to have a kindle just save for the superior kindle paperwhitemymaccom review rating 8 out of 10,my mymaccom review

3.0,i got this for christmas so have been using it for about 3 months i really enjoy reading most books on the kindle the text is very clear and as advertised works in bright sunlight the screen also is designed so that you dont really notice smudges or fingerprints while reading its much lighter and smaller than a paper book so its perfect for reading on the bus and i love that i can get ebooks from my library straight to my kindle the battery life is incredible i can read quite a few novels before needing to recharge and one of the biggest selling points of the devicehowever it is not a robust device i bought a sleeve for it to protect the screen and kept my kindle in the sleeve whenever i was taking it anywhere i still ended up with 3 scratches on the screen in less than 3 months so ive had to put a screen protector on my kindle which means i no longer have a glarefree screen it seems like its either keep the kindle screen as is unprotected and enjoy the glarefree matte finish but have lots of scratches or use a screen protector and read with glare but no scratches except the ones that are already there from the 3 months without a screen protector i am very disappointed that my screen scratched so easily because i was quite careful with my kindle in general another thing that i find irritating is that lint seems to get stuck between the screen and the black plastic casing and is very hard to remove this is more of a nuisance than a real issue until you go to put a screen protector on then the lint creates air bubblesoverall i would cautiously recommend a kindle to someone looking for an ereader but im very glad i didnt spend more than 59 on it bought during christmas promotions i would advise anyone to buy some sort of sleeve or case for your device immediately and use it diligently to avoid scratches on the screen id also advise getting a screen protectorbut give yourself a few days to enjoy how great reading on the kindle is before compromising the reading experience with a screen protector,great for reading but screen is very delicate

5.0,being my first kindle i chose the entry level priced model and am very happy with it i dont mind that it is not lit as i dont need to read it in the dark i love being able to download books to take with me on a trip although i still take physical books with me too cant help mysef  and i especially love being able to send my own material either saved pdfs or inspirational material ive written for myself to my kindle via my kindle email address as an attachment with convert in the title i cant remember where i picked up this tip but its a fantastic service i always keep my kindle in my handbag because my idea of hell is being somewhere even for ten minutes without somewhere to read lol i bought a kindle cover locally and like that i can hold it more like a book plus its protected in my bag ive looked at the fancier kindles but at this stage and very happy with this one,love having a kindle this one is an excellent beginners model
1.0,im giving it only one star because because you do not enclose a paper instruction sheet with it i like and have read two books on it but imi but i have been unable to read anymore because i cannot figure out how to get to my library to start a new book i bought some instructions downloaded to my kindle but imi but it is kind of hard to turn to a specific ssection to find out how to find a book to read i finally found a dummy book for it but it has yet to arrive i am reading on my redman my kindle pretty girl is sitting idle so since i had to pay for instructions wjhich should have been included forold farts like me you onlyget one star i might up it if i can understand the dummy book get it up readable i have been very satisfied with my kindle fire but am not with this help help crash,i like and have read two books on it but imi

5.0,i won a kindle 6 at an awards dinner as a door prize lucky me so i opened the sealed box and the unit was already turned on and was in spanish it took me over an hour to get it back to us english since i cant read or speak spanish i have an 8 tablet before this came along so its not new to me the thing i did like with this the battery last a long time and its smaller then my tablet and handier to read with and use the app used in his kindle wasnt the best for selections of reading material i wanted to get magazines subscriptions just for the kindle but of course the app didnt or couldnt go there so then i had to go on line with the computer to check them out  after you set up your account and register your kindle with amazon you can buy your books and reading material and have it sent directly to your kindle over wifi to your kindle email address to read and have the kindle will down load it on the unit for you to read i thought was really pretty coola friend of mine said there where places or websites where you could get free books to read so i am going to look into that soon after i read the ones i haveoverall i think this the right size 6 to have about the size of a paperback book the print can be changed to bigger or smaller so its not a problem to read easy to carry around and use i love mine its better then a tablet because it doesnt light up the screen the battery last a lot longer then a tablet thanks and enjoy the happy reading,just like having the public library in your one hand holds that many books

5.0,i was a legend in elementary school for the number of books i read and spent hours upon hours of each day reading i eventually taught myself to speed read in 3rd grade and from 3rd to 6th grade i read nearly 12 of the books in the school library i was a true book worm and have the plaques and rewards from my 6th grade teacher buried somewhere in a basement as time went on i grew out of reading actually i grew into other things i still loved to read however needed to go to school work 2 jobs etc etcthings in the real world have slowly returned to a calmer flow for me and i have really been having the craving to start reading again i mentioned this and my wonderful lovely fiancee ordered me a kindle for christmas i have powered through 5 books since then and figured i have used it enough to write a reviewmy first impression when unboxing and feeling this my first ereader i was shocked at the weight very light and the screen not glossy in the slightest it came with battery so i pressed the button on the bottom and it powered up the screen flashes each time it redraws the image displayed which was weird at first but now i really like it gives some feedback as to when you actually press the screen while readingthe screen is nice textured smoothly yet it isnt glass smooth like the fire or android tablets feels like a plasticy paper basically i like this as well helps to remind of the old analog medium there is some glare or wash out perhaps when a very white light is shone directly on to the screen ie led flashlightlantern however you can mitigate this by using a light that is not as brightno backlight no problem i wanted something that was more like a book not another gosh darned gadget i have like 4000 different screens i stare at all day long and wanted something that didnt feel digital i use an old school book lamp which is awesome considering i have had it since the late 90sthe kindle daily deals are great tons of books changed daily for like 2 bucks how can you go wrong with that the lending library is also quite nice just one more reason to go with the amazon reader vs the othersthe only negative i have about this reader is that my fiancee has requisitioned the use of it as of this past sunday and told me i can have it back when she is done i do not know when she will be done with it so i am ordering another one for me and one each for my mom sister dad and brotheroverall i am sold on the ereader wave ill definitely keep buying these thingsalso the roocase for the kindle paperwhite fits this thing wonderfully and is way way cheaper than the amazon case,so good i ordered 5 more lol

5.0,i wasnt too keen on the idea on getting an ereader call me a romantic but i do love holding a physical books since it comes with perks that ereaders dont ie they smell nice never die out on you look beautiful on shelves in your room can bookmark pages with awsome bookmarksetc but ive had to change my view on things since ive actually run out of room for all my books my father had bought me a nook when those first came out but the screen made my eyes sore and it wasnt as enjoyable and also my brother and me ended up completely ruining it so it was time for a change i chose the most basic of the kindles since all i really want to do is read and save space and money im also super bad with technology and dont really need anything fancy this kindle does the job i absolutely love it its got so many cool features that blow my mind its feather light and super thin so it takes up zero space i can take it with me everywhere and so it allows me to read whenever i have time this is honestly a pretty good investment if you are an avid reader with a book wish list that never ends with the kindle you have a bunch of books at hand at a size smaller than a paperback,call me a romantic but i do love holding a physical books since it comes with perks

4.0,while i have a 55 smartphone and have used it with the kindle android reader app i am finding that this kindle is a more immediate media and easier to read in very bright light i am doing more reading of ebooks this in combo with overdrive access to library ebooks and the many ebooks available on amazon especially samples which give me a preview for books im waiting for loaners and freebiei now have a wealth of material both downloaded and stored on the amazon cloud the experimental browser is especially handy for reading news web sites and my email accounts im hoping to see future updates that will make it more efficient in accessing all online material the unit is fast for reading i like the link to goodreads the dictionary is handy text options are adequate the monthly free purchase of one prereleased ebook was an unexpected surprise and the ads are not distractingi appreciate that with the addition of ads the reader more affordable and available at a price point that made it attractive to me for night reading i can use my smartphone and the syncing feature keeps my reading progress seamlessly coordinated between the two devices for accessories i also purchased a verso ereader clip light offered on amazon for 899 a discount available in one of those reader adsit works great for both reading and as a handy bedside night light i also got the fyy® classic slim fit folio leather case for kindle at 688 on amazoni figured it would protect the unit while i used it traveling the landscape features of the case will not be used because this kindle does not have screen rotation and is only used in a portrait orientation im hoping i can read it inflight with just the overhead cabin seatlight ill update this review once i had the opportunity overall with the flexibility it offers i am glad i made the purchase,first impressions of this reader are positive
1.0,i havent even got this to work yet,one star
2.0,i liked many features of this i just wanted a basic device and according to the description this would be it it would hold a lot of books though i only read one at a time it has a bookmark feature you swipe to turn the page so far so goodonce i charged it and loaded books on i found that i was having difficulty reading even next to a lamp changing the font didnt help this version advertised that it was like reading the printed page not so the background of the page is gray the text is a very dark gray not quite blacki compared this with a paper book im reading and the difference was startling the paper book was blackonwhite thats what i consider normal even an old paperback with yellowed pages has more contrast than this grayongray devicethere was no way to change it so im sending it back and getting an earlier model paperwhiteand before someone asks yes i did know this version wasnt lighted but with an actual white background and crisp black text i wouldnt have needed a light since i can read a real paperback just fine,difficult for me to read
1.0,i wish i had never bought this did not realize that the screen did not light up so night time in bed reading which is what i bought it for it is hard to use and understand i would suggest going ahead and buying a kindle hd wish i had,waste of money for sure
5.0,i tend to get frequent headaches im not sure why i am so sensitive to things but such is life so things like tablets and ereaders i am very picky about if something is too bright or has a weird look to the text i get a headache i also read nonstop i love to read i needed something to satisfy my need to take my library everywhere and something that wouldnt leave me with a migraine at the end of the first chapter this kindle was amazing for both it is super light weight and portable ive been able to fit it into relatively small wristlets and clutches i take this everywhere with me and i dont have to carry a large purse to do so not only that but i love the ink technology when reading it looks like an actual page and sometimes i forget it isnt all in all i love kindle and this kindle was perfect for me,five stars

5.0,i bought this for my wife who hates reading on the ipad she absolutely loves this thing and can hardly put it down so far shes read 4 books on this kindle and has only used half of the battery life im even amazed at how much the screen looks just like the page of a book i highly recommend this product,the right touch
1.0,terrible hate it ,one star
1.0,i had the original glare free kindle that gave me the lines of death i loved it this one has almost no battery life i have to go to the cloud and download everything to my kindle its thicker and more cumbersome than the original i do not like the page turn function in comparison to the original this one will jump multiple pages every time i set it down even momentarily i do not consider the more updated version to be equal to the original,i loved it this one has almost no battery life
5.0,my first kindle was the kindle 2 it was still pretty expensive back then but i loved it at the time i was doing a bit of travelling back and forth between coasts and i was always either lugging a bunch of heavy books with me or spending too much money at the airport for more so the price was justified at the timemy first upgrade from the k2 was the first generation kindle fire that i received as a gift for christmas 2011 i was impressed at the time that the fire was a fraction of the price and was also a tabletunfortunately my eyes just didnt like constantly reading on a backlit device and i wanted more freedom in my tablet experience and passed that on to one of the kidsi eventually got an ipad mini and decided that i wanted to go back to a regular eink kindle no frills so here we arei love this kindle because i wanted simple no frills no lights and that is exactly what this is if i absolutely need a light i use a clip on book light or my ipad which i can handle using the kindle app in short dosesi thought i would miss the keyboard and page turn buttons from the k2 but i dont flicking the screen or pressing the side work just fine for mei also have back one of the features that i missed when using the kindle fire or kindle app collections i have all of my collections neatly ordering all of my books instead of a giant list or that annoying carousel i am so happy the collections feature is still a thing on the eink kindles,know what youre buying five stars for the kindle being exactly what the product page says it is
3.0,this is a good replacement for my old kindle which last about 5 years but it is missing the audio component of the last kindlefewer features for the exact same priceas it happens i had one audio book and so the loss was not that great but i dont recommend it for people who have many audiobooks,not recommended for people who are replacing a kindle that has lots of audiobooks
5.0,can i have one for free im just a little kid😥😥😥😥😥😞😞😞😞😞😞😖😖😖😖,five stars
1.0,do not buy a 79 kindle it has no lighti was excited to get a new kindle for christmas as i have been reading kindle books on my ipad for a while i now find out it is nearly useless as it has no screen light so you can only read it in a bright roomthis is a disgrace to amazons other great products and they should stop selling kindle it does not have the basic functionality expected,nonfunctional basic do not buy

2.0,ive had a kindle keyboard for years and when it quit on me i bought the new generation 7 touchscreen i wish you still made the kindle keyboard i am not at all happy with the new one the new way you have set up to deal with collections sucks if you are holding the device in your left hand you have to turn the page with your right hand thats just a couple of the problems with the generation 7 i talked to one of your chat line people and was told that there have been a lot of complaints about the new 7 and that the engineers are working on a software update to fix some of the problems my recommendation to you is to make a new generation kindle keyboard and make it exactly like the original you would sell them like hotcakes i would personally buy a half dozen just so i would never have to go through this again,i am not at all happy with the new one

2.0,i have a kindle paperweight 2 a nook simple touch a kindle keyboard and now this basic kindle touchright off the bat i will say that this is the worst ereader i have usedwhy i dislike it1 its light but feels cheap really cheap its boxy and ergonomically awkward to hold2 the background screen is white which is good but the font is somewhat blurry and smeary compared to my kindle keyboard which has sharper fonts and better overall contrast3 backround bleed you can see previous page shadows on screen the page sometimes doesnt fully refresh i have tried looking under settings to solve this issue to no avail customer support says this is normal my kindle keyboard and nook simple touch do not not have this problem4 sensitive touchscreen i love touch screens and i prefer them to buttons i have no issues with this version not having page buttons like so many people demand i personally dont care but the touchscreen is way too sensitive and glitchy any little slight touch will jump pages bring up the menu and cause a complete distraction if your really deep into a book not coolthese are my main gripes with this particular kindle device yes it is very basic and i do like that it has 4gb of storage as opposed to last years model which has only 2gb not that you will likely ever need 4gb but still i do enjoy the lightweight factor but i think that anyone interested in an entry level ereader should really consider getting a good second hand kindle keyboard or nook simple touch i personally love the nook simple touch and believe is better than this kindle in every way imaginable although i would advise to stay away from the new nook glowlight as that device is severely limited unless you are completely immersed into the barnes noble ecosystemthis kindle is not bad but considering this is amazons 7th generation kindle offering i expected sharper fonts and better functionality not to mention a much better design yes this is basic but that doesnt mean it has to be cheaply made which this device definitely is i love kindle and although they dont support expansion sd slots i love the amazon ecosystem and their customer service is second to none this is what keeps me coming back to them,unacceptable for a 7th generation kindle

5.0,after a few years of using a kindle fire primarily for reading and finding that impractical due to its weight and screen glare and after months of going back and forth on whether a plain old kindle would be worth the investment i took the plunge why did i wait so longi love how light it is i love being able to read in direct light again i love the integration between amazon and my library system so now borrowing books is a twoclick process i remember having to use a usb cable for the first few years they offered digital books ugh i adjust the text size frequently depending on what or where im reading at 41 ive discovered my eye sight is not what it used to be and sometimes needs a little boost i look up words on the fly its almost always in my purse since it takes up so little room and adds so little weightseriously i love this little piece of technology,only wish id bought it sooner
2.0,hate that i cant read it in dark only with light on,two stars
5.0,i love this simple ereader unbeatable for the 60 price who cares if i cant use apps and has limited internet capabilities i already have enough devices that do those things i love the booklike printi thought it would be nice if there was a backlight for reading at night but after researching the print technology which makes it viewable even during the brightest hours of the day i realized that doesnt matter a simple booklight works just fine to resolve that issue and there is no glare when you use a light on it plus a backlight would not only drain the battery insanely faster but would make it more like reading a tablet or laptop increasing eye strain i like that this looks just like a book when reading i appreciate that it does not contribute to the eyestrain one experiences from staring at electronic screens all day,love it

4.0,great for travel but i still prefer my kindle fire hd i purchased this basic kindle in preparation for a vacation i knew id be out in the sun a lot and my kindle fire screen just isnt conducive to reading in sunlight i chose this version of the kindle because i knew id have my fire hd for reading at night so didnt want to spend the extra money for the backlight although i bought a voyager for my mom and she is really enjoying itthis basic kindle was just what i needed for the trip i spent several hours over a couple of weeks using this without having to rechare and was able to stay up on my reading its lightweight and fits great in a pocket interestingly i think the kindle app features are better than the ones on this basic unit still i would recommend this to anyone who needs something lightweight and convenient for reading out of doors,great for reading in sunlight but i still prefer my kindle fire hd
2.0,after i purchased this reader i found out that it will not download from the public librarys in canada nowhere in the info for the device did it mention this fact i would not have bought this reader had i been aware of this rather severe shortcoming i do not intend to buy books from amazon forever  i will change readers and buy local instead,misleading info
3.0,i didnt keep itit was not in any way like my first kindle which finally died after 5 years or so amazon was great took it back and i will buy another as soon as i decide i bought this touch since it wasnt back lit and i have read enough about electronics and lighted things to know they are not conducive to good sleep but i really didnt like it it constantly changed font sizes when i was dozing and touched it i would be on strange pages for no reason except for dozing and touching random things it would probably be good for someone who had not had a really good early one but not for me so for now i do not have a kindle i am looking,gave it an ok but sent it back

5.0,this is my second kindle i had bought the 2nd generation kindle in 2009 but i love this one more the small size so much lighter and i can read my books a lot better i bought the 79 version and i do not mind the ads or suggestions at all in fact i welcome the suggestions for books to read the ads do not get in the way of your reading experience so save the 20 bucks this kindle is meant for reading only and that is why i bought it if i wanted to play games or web search i would have bought the kindle fire i just want to read and this kindle is just made for that love how it fits in my purse and doesnt take any room i am really happy with kindle they are the best in ereaders,best choise i made was the 79 kindle
3.0,i am absolutely not happy with this purchase,three stars
1.0,have had many kindles the original the fire and the paper white bought this one to replace the original just to read on the beach it loosesits place the fonts jump out every few pages and very often it takes way too many swipes to get to the next pagewould notrecommend it wish i had purchased another paperwhite one other complaint cant down load the few games that i like on to it,not a good kindle 
5.0,its great for reading in normal lighting conditions i knew it didnt have a back light when i bought it and although having one would be nice it isnt necessary for me i got it to supplement my ipad and iphone to take on trips and in public when i want to read without either draining my phone battery or carrying a heavy old ipad2 its very sensitive to touchpressure on the screen im still getting used to if i put it face down or it brushes my shirt it changes the page which is a little annoying overall im happy with the purchase and it does what i wanted it to do if i use it enough i may upgrade to a backlit one in the future,great for reading in normal light
5.0,i love my kindle i have hundreds of books on my computer for several years now but until i bought the kindle i didnt have a comfortable manner in which to read them im retired so i have plenty of time to read and ive made good use of my kindle in the short time ive had it i consider it one of the best investments ive made in many years,best investment ive made in years

4.0,i previously had a kindle keyboard that served me dutifully for five years that is until my habit of reading in bed before falling asleep ended up with me planting my knee right in the screen in the middle of the night and cracking itlooking for a replacement i didnt really want anything fancy i just needed a simple ereader that wouldnt hurt my eyes with the ridiculous amount of time i spend glued to the screenthis kindle isnt all that different from my previous version i do notice the text seems crisper and consequently slightly easier on my eyes no this doesnt have a back light but i dont really want one if theres not enough light to read by comfortably i probably shouldnt be reading in the first place my eyes get enough abuse as it isthe page turn buttons are gone but i dont really miss them its actually easier to lightly tap the screen as opposed to the buttons on my previous kindle and makes for a more fluid reading experienceim also slightly thankful my old kindle broke and i could justify the purchase of a new one the touchscreen makes everything so much simpler and faster especially typing thank goodness they dont make the keyboard anymore haha even if i do leave fingerprints everywherethe internet browser while hideously slow and really not meant for browsing the internet is also a bit faster than the previous version but this is an ereader if youre looking for something that does it all id look at the more expensive models for my purposes when i just want to look up an article online that i meant to read later it does just finenavigation through the different features is straightforward everythings easy to find plenty of storage tooone thing i do miss is the ability to listen to audiobooks it doesnt seem to have any audio output at allso for an entry level ereader this is great and the price is reasonable,if theres not enough light to read by comfortably i probably shouldnt be reading in the first

5.0,even though i didnt realize includes special offers meant advertising would appear on my kindle i still love it the ads which appear as screensavers when im not using my kindle dont bother me at all neither do the small banner ads that occasionally appear at the bottom of the screenwifi connected effortlessly as did my hundreds of great free book downloads from amazon and i just love the simplicity of barely moving a muscle to touch the screen to turn pages i also really love the ability to just touch a word to see its definition and to have a listing of all the new words ive learned amazing bookmarks are also wonderful allowing me to be reading several books at a time without ever losing my place i have so many great books downloaded i feel like a kid in a candy shop hurrying from one delicious confection to another and not being able to decide which one i like the mosti have spent many relaxing hours reading my kindle so far and felt no eyestrain whatsoever i am surprised and delighted at how much i am enjoying electronic delivery of books i really thought i would not like using an ereader and knew i could just send it back if i didnt like it i am elderly and beginning to have difficulty holding up books and the size and weight of my new kindle 6 glarefree touchscreen display wifi is just perfectonce again i have been completely amazed at the delivery speed of amazoncom i live in hawaii where shipping times can be ridiculous but never with amazon orders always arrive just as estimated or even beforei also ordered the new nupro folio type cover to protect my kindle while travelling it was 10 less than its kindle counterpart and i am very happy with itmy only difficulty has been in finding out how to use all the amazing capabilities of this little gadget amazons online instructions are somewhat cumbersome to use and i had trouble finding the instructions on my kindle until i did some experimenting kinda wish there was a hard copy booklet included but i am terrifically happy that i made this purchase with small monthly payments and i know i will treasure and enjoy my kindle for a long time to come,love it

5.0,the new kindle ereader was and is exactly what i expected i purchased it to replace my old ereader which no longer worked because i got such good service from the old one i declined the upgraded readers that were offered at discount and instead ordered the closest thing to my old ereader when the new one came i quickly put it to work only to discover that it was defective and worked no better than the old one i printed a postagefree label online making a request that it be replaced not refunded but when i got the confirmation it noted that a refund would be given as soon as the returned item had been received because i wanted a replacement not a refund i called amazon customer service to straighten it out the response was swift and exceptional the representative not only understood where the mistake had been made but corrected it and then ordered a replacement this was on a friday two days later on sunday the new ereader was in my mailbox quick service is one thing sunday delivery quite another but thats what the representative specified and thats what i got the new reader has new features that set it apart from the old chief among these is a very easytouse touch screen for changing pages as well as for a number of other functions the glarefree screen sets it apart from tablets providing a high quality of readability even in direct sunlight this was true of the old one too and was a major reason i chose to go with an option close to what i had before the touch screen eliminates the old pagechange buttons which means fewer moving parts to break though that never was a problem with my old one over all i have to say i am delighted both with the product and with the service the failure of the first reader was unfortunate but those things happen from time to time with new products the level of service after the sale was so good that it removed any negative effects the failure of the first product might have left the replacement ereader was in my hands well before amazon received my returned item back which shows a high level of concern for providing amazon customers the best possible service well done and i am greatly enjoying the new ereader,excellent product even better service
1.0,i regret this purchase assuming it was lighted it is not therefore almost useless,therefore almost useless
3.0,you get what you pay for the more expensive models have better features the touch screen isnt best a little sensitive pages turn at the slightest graze and it tends to flip multiple pages at a time some pros are its size and battery life its small enough to carry anywhere and the battery can go weeks without needing a charge,the more expensive models have better features the touch screen isnt best
1.0,cannot connect to wifi or registervery complicated and it is veryaggrevating,one star
3.0,it has a scratch on the screen the thing is usable but just not the one you would be happy with,scratch on the screen
3.0,i love the paper white ereader i got this one for my birthday just a day ago and while the touchscreen is neat i really do not care for it much i bought the first edition of the kindle with the keyboard and the side buttons to turn pages and it felt as close to reading a book as i could possibly imagine on an electronic device your finger could just rest on the button and you turn the page now you have to tap which that itself isnt a deal breaker i can handle that but the device also lost a great feature with the case i had for my old one that snapped right into a cover and had a light that went off the battery of the kindle perhaps there is something out there like that and i hope there is but i was hoping to use the one i had it was very nice quality i highly prefer the old version of the kindle i didnt buy this kindle to play games or ooh and awe at the advanced technology all i wanted was a device that would hold my books that i could take anywhere and read whatever i wanted at any time instead they try to make this ereader into some type of tablet i dont consider it a tablet i dont want a tablet if i did the paper white kindle would be the last thing i would choose,touch kindle is ok by disapointing
1.0,returned it,one star
3.0,i have been considering purchasing an ereader for a few years now however each time i read the reviews and consider all the additional pieces such as cover charger etc that i need to buy i have finally decided to just purchase my books one at a time i still like the idea that i can open a book turn to my bookmark and continue reading where i stopped if i come to a word that i dont understand i can grab my websters dictionary and look it up wowi never have to worry about my book running low on battery power and so long as i pay the energy bill each month i usually have plenty of light to see the pages i can also pick it up and carry it anywhere and even drop it without damaging it and my book does not come with any unwanted advertisements or useless warranties to purchase one more important item to consider is that i can either keep my book pass it on to a friend or donate it to charity in short this is just not for me,by a real book
5.0,love all the kindles this was a present for my 80 year old mom she is getting the hang of it bc sometimes she doesnt want to get out of the house and go to the public library bad weather or not feeling up to par she doesnt do all the adding of books and taking care of the small details that goes into checking out and returning books i do that but for reading it she likes it fine the kindle fire makes her eyes red and puffy as the screen is hard on her eyes but the e reader does noti also have one but it is an older model love my ereader nothing is better,love the kindle ereader nothing better
1.0,i own a kindle and i purchased two books from amazon however i am unable to find the second book i have therefore wasted 1299 i am at a loss as to what to do and i can find no help from any where,i have therefore wasted 12 99 i am at a loss as 
3.0,i received my kindle 6 glarefree on time while setting up the kindle the touchscreen would not let me select not to accept a 30day free trial of kindle unlimited i had to accept it then go into myaccount and cancel not sure if this was a glitch or a ploy by amazon i mainly purchased this kindle in order to read outside in sunlight pool park etc my very first time i used the kindle outside i had a problem with the touchscreen i would tap in the area for next page and font size would popup instead i was no where near tapping the top of the kindle page where you would get change font size menu i had not had this problem inside i considered returning the kindle but continued to use it to date the problem has not reoccurred hopefully i havent screwed myself and down the line it returns i find the resolutionreadability of this kindle as borderline it is definitely difficult trying to determine which book is which in the library especially when a book series has pretty much the same cover with a different title once a book is selected the reading is acceptable however if i had it to do over again i would probably buy the kindle 6 paperwhite for the resolution and backlighting,resolution borderline acceptable
1.0,got this for my 9 year old son he cant even play games on it i wanted him to use it for reading but also play educational games to improve his math skills this is a big disappoitment it is also not user friendly and is hard to navigate i wanted a kindle with no ads when i requested the ads be removed i was automatically charged for it without authorizing this charge to my credit card,got this for my 9 year old son he 
5.0,i was using the same kindle for about 5 years and it was the original gray screen with the letters buttons on the bottom although it still worked it was cracked and bruised from falling off a car etc i didnt need anything high tech as i have a tablet but i dont like reading on the tablet so i bought this new kindle before vacation it has some nice upgrades from my prior kindle feels sturdier and is easy to hold and read on the beach love it,love my new kindle
1.0,not worth buying first one broke within a year just died this one xzct same but you cant change the brightness this is my third kindle tells you sometthing,dont buy it
3.0,i wanted something light to use for traveling that can hold my books i purchased my kindle from amazoncom and registered it on the us kindle storepros light easy to use long battery life screen has no glare and you still need a reading light which i dont mind it is easy to flip pages with one hand holding the kindle from either side the special offers i was worried about only display on the screen when the kindle is turned off so its not as intrusive as i expected i expected annoying popups so this is definitely better good value i got it on sale and you couldnt beat the price for any other ereader comes with a builtin experimental browser but it loads very slow and i would not recommend this be used for browsing the internet as a tabletcons very difficult to browse kindle store directly from device unable to sort titles by price they are displayed only by popularity rating and release date as it is not as responsive as a tablet having to click on every title to see the price turns browsing for books into a long ordeal i recommend browsing and buying ebooks on a desktoplaptop does not allow you to purchase books from your usbased kindle store while abroad this is very important to those customers that are buying this for travel you will be forced to change your home country in the settings and will have access only to that countrys kindle store with the prices and product availability on there next day youre in a different country same thing if you dont download your books ahead of time you can just pretty much forget it if this would have been communicated to customers on amazon i would have skipped buying the kindle inaccurate product description see point above terrible customer service for any issues you have with kindle being told by email to call instead of receiving help over email while youre abroad is not good service black and white display only if you plan to order magazines through kindle you will lose a lot of the experience in the blackwhite colours,cute and light ereader but not practical for traveling due to download issues with us kindle store
1.0,i have a kindle fire and this was just too basic for me probably good if you are not used to color apps etc returned it,probably good if you are not used to color
4.0,i am so happy with my kindle i love everything about it i can read in bed while traveling because it just so cutely fits in my coat pocket i love the paperwhite edition even more because its glarefree and that really does the trickthe only thing that i would recommend amazon to work on is possibly the touchscreen because it is not very touch sensitive but thats just a minor defect in compared to how amazing the kindle is overall i am so glad that i got this because i get to now catch up with my reading even during my super hectic work schedule would totally recommend it,i am so happy with my kindle
1.0,i read in bed this kindle has no light no back light wtf all kindles are supposed to have the light what a ripoff,i read in bed this kindle has no light 
5.0,this is my first kindle i think i have the slowest internet service in the us and it still downloads a 500 page book in about one minutei received this 3 days ago and have read 2 complete books and done some research on the web it is exactly what i expected after reading other reviews it has everything needed to be a great reader enough features to make it a great tool for internet surfing and the sizeweight are great for portabilityread before you buy so you understand the different features available on each model i did not want the ads so i paid a little more to get mine without the special offers this unit is not lighted if a basic uncluttered reader is what you want this is a great unit for you,super pleasantly surprised by the speed of downloads
1.0,impossible to read at night without a lightfalse adversting self adjusting internal light not as advertised,one star
2.0,i had the awesome keyboard kindle that had 3g wireless and suddenly it froze and stopped working so i went to replace it and this is what came up as the replacement im not a real touch screen person because if you handle this kindle anywhere except on the edgesthe thing advances or backs up i also didnt see the small print that said this replacement or upgrade kindle was wifi only which is a pain when traveling and the wifi needs to log in even in free wifi zones without the 3g which is 3 times as expensive as my original keyboard kindle and this wifi only reader i have to really plan ahead when purchasing my books and cant just order up the next book any time anywhere this kindle has the ability to read the screen in the sun but i dont think this is close to being an improvement on the keyboard kindle that i adored,i had the awesome keyboard kindle that had 3g wireless and suddenly it 
1.0,our family has had many kindles and this one is the most difficult to work with wish i had ordered any other,unfortunate choice
5.0,i had an older kindle that was wonderful but it was a little clunky in that it was gasp about the same footprint size as my ipad mini after i poured coffee on it in a crazy accident at a conference it was heartbroken for our anniversary my wife bought me this new kindlei love it heres a quick breakdown staring with the piece i worried most abouti was afraid of the ads being obnoxious and intrusive but they are almost invisible to me as someone who sees much much more distracting things on the internet daily the ads are for books so its not like im getting things pitched to me that are outside of my realms of interest for all the scariness of thinking im going to get ads consonantly shot at me its no problem for mewhats great is everything else the touch screen is responsive but not hair trigger the display is as clear as anything the controls all hide themselves when i dont want them and the spring into visibility when i need them its light and fits easily into a bag or even a pocket on a jacket or cargo pants so yes i 100 recommend this if youre looking for a kindle,this is the best special offers included
1.0,it was a mess up with this product they gave me an iphone 6 case instead of this beware of not getting the right product at the right time,it was a mess up with this product they

5.0,all the reading im doing on lighted devices is killing my eyes this is the convenience of an ereader with the nonlighted service of a printed page much easier on your eyes and you can change the font size to suit you look words up and search wikipedia with ease in a pop up window then get back to your book the touch screen does take a little getting used to if you are used to older kindles but i think its great they still offer a nonlighted version,nonbacklit kindles rule
1.0,just for the the kindle fire,one star
5.0,i purchased my kindle 6 at best buy a week or two ago for 5999 the same price that it was on amazon the same day but i wanted it now so i went there insteadthe kindle is a little odd if you are used to an ipad or other tablet and are expecting more however it does exactly what it is designed to do1 provide you with wifi to access your kindle cloud books2 easily allow you to search and purchase kindle books on amazon3 eink no glare my big issue with no backlight thank you jesusof course there are a few advanced features such as the dictionary but that is pretty much it this little device has got me excited to read more which is awesome i just finished my first kindle experience and i must say my eyes did not grow tired at all as they do on ipad phone or laptop,does what it is supposed to
1.0,i bought the kindle during black friday for 4900 i was charged 7900 normal price i wrote email for correction and recieved email back with reassurance that the cost would be corrected it has not been corrected yet other than that the kindle is great just what i wanted,other than that the kindle is great just what i wanted
5.0,i just received my kindle today its my first one im impressed its small light and aside from a few minor kinks really easy to use being new to kindle i dont see what the issue is with the lack of buttons for turning pages i did some research before my purchase and that seemed to be a problem well it turns out you dont even have to swipe the screen to turn the page just tapping the screen does the job ultimately the only thing i had to change was the special offers feature i bought mine with them and to be fair they were largely unobtrusive after a while however i opted to pay the 20 fee to unsubscribe from them i think its just me but the device now seems more like my own having special offers made it feel like i was renting my kindle from amazon aside from that its been smooth sailing i hope to use this kindle for years to come and though i still like the feel of a real book it definitely beats lugging them around,a solid alternative to traditional books
1.0,i didnt like it ,one star
1.0,the touch screen seems to be extremely sensitive when you dont want it to be i was constantly finding that i had been jumped backward or forward half a dozen pages and the font size kept jumping up to maximumi also had problems with it randomly freezing and then rebooting amazon tech support suggested a number of things none of which helped i finally returned it for a refund this was my 3rd kindle ebook reader but now im a kobo glo hd owner it was less expensive than a comparable kindle and also makes it easier to download and read ebooks from my local library,moving away from kindle
1.0,not what i expected,one star
4.0,this replaces one of the original kindles its taken some getting used to its thicker than my old one but smaller overall i like that i can change the font size the touch screen is a little too touchy though if my thumb happens to be over the edge when im reading the heat from my thumb turns the page when im not ready to turn i do like the other a aspects of it although now i have to buy another case as the ones i have are now too big for this one overall so far i like it but i wish my old one had not died,i like that i can change the font size
1.0,print too small,one star
4.0,i love it except when i do something that brings up a popup and scroll down in the popup then it likes to lock up and i have to reboot kindle thats a bit maddening ps as of nov 18 i am no longer having a problem with locking up when scrolling popups a pleasant surprise,solid value and great except 
1.0,no back light,haha no
5.0,i bought one of these and now carry it almost everywhere i go stuck waiting in line or at the doctors office or somewhere else unexpectedly you are prepared i am not sure what the max capacity is for one of these but its in the thousands of books if i were to be marooned on a deserted island id want one of these loaded with all the reading material that id want for the rest of my life along with a solar charger of course,get one
1.0,sorry but not offering a light or including a light in the case is complete crapvery deceptive on kindles part very very unhappy with this product would not recommend,avoid thisno light crap
5.0,ive had 3 different models of kindles from one of the earliest with the keyboard and wifi3g to the paperwhite with the lit back to this one and my opinion of them remains unchanged they are the best thing to happen to people that love reading and honestly this is the best model for most people this is why🔘 touch screen nearly everyone is used to touch screens by now and this kindle is no different its easy to turn the pages but now it is also easy to type notes or search a book even compared to the older models with a full keyboard since im so used to touch typing and one smaller thing turning the pages via the touch screen means i dont have to reach to the corner of the device to turn the page as i did with the older model with the edge buttons🔘 eink display look like a real book seriously its only 167 ppi but thats part of the reason it does in most of the paperback and hardcover books ive read in the past the font was always almost a bit grainy just naturally due to the printing process at the time and i know this isnt intentional here with the kindle but thats what it reminds me of and why it feels like a real book🔘 no back light not a downside to me since any place i read i would have enough light anyway i have a lamp at home planes have individual lights and my office has plenty of lighting studies have even shown that reading in low light does not damage eyes it only strains them temporarily and finally and this is huge if you read before bed the lack of a backlight means less blue light directly into your eyes to affect your brains sleep cycle so youll fall asleep more readily🔘 crazy battery life definitely related to the eink display and lack of a backlight the kindle will stay in standby mode forever seriously i charge it once every month or two when i use it sparingly and when i take it on 12 week vacations i never have to charge it this is honestly the best thing about it since sure you could use your smartphonetablet to read books but both of those will rarely if ever last as long as the kindle and thats assuming you have them in airplane mode at the lowest brightness its nice to have a device that you can pick up always knowing its got charge🔘 slightly thickerheavier i say this since compared to the older hard buttons entry level model its a tiny bit thicker as well as heavier this is insignificant to me but its definitely noticeable likely due to the added hardware of a touchscreen display🔘 wifi only obviously used to sync book and it works great at that and quickly since books are pretty small in file size you can even look up your kindle email address in your amazon account and mail yourself personal pdfs or documents theres also a web browser in the kindle though so you could use this device as a last resort if your smartphonelaptoptablet are out of battery🔘 file storage this is actually really nice since you can save files just as if it was a usb flash drive onto the kindle as well as manually load books from your pc if you have any availableoverall this is an amazing device and indispensable for those that love reading but dont have space or money for a library also great for travelers who like to pack light such as myself,handheld library w near infinite battery life
1.0,needed kindle,wrong machine
1.0,when did the kindle change to a piece of garbage this is my fifth yes fifth kindle ill admit i left one on a plane and i accidentally packed one in an outer luggage pocket but the other two just died im not even mad about that after owning and using them as long as i had i understand it cant last forever however my last one just stopped working yes i recharged it and rather than trying to get a replacement i decided to just pay 80 for a new one what did i receive a giant piece of garbage its ounces heavier its thicker its casing is straight up cheap and it lacks the basic functions im ready to start using the nook i received years ago as a gift and walk away from kindle and kindle unlimited,when did the kindle change to a piece of garbage
5.0,im glad i finally switched from reading books on my iphone and ipad to an actual ebook reader there isnt anything i can say that hasnt said before about this the screen is great for reading i read about 45 hour a week on my kindle and my eyes dont hurt like they did when i read on my ipad and iphone i can read while waiting for the bus and its light and compact to fit into my bag easily and quicklythe lack of backlight doesnt bother me because if its dark i just turn on a light as if i was reading an actual book,im glad i finally switched from reading books on my iphone 
1.0,my other kindle had a bulb on it so i could light the screen this one doesnt i have no light and cannot find how to turn one on i like to read at night if u cant help me it is going back also 3 days after i buy it you sell it for 2000 less than i paid kind of rotten i cant read at night as the screen doesnt light,disgusted

5.0,im a diehard reader like 23 a week and have been known to dig into a book and never come out of it until the book is done love reading i wasnt sure id like the kindle because i love everything about paperback books the first book i read on mine was a little awkward ill admit but once i got through it i was hooked i dont use any of the extra features except the font style and size but i resize according to reading environment for instance i read every night before i go to sleep if its a little dim in the room i just enlarge the font and im good to go i would definitely buy this again and fyi you can now borrow books from your librarys website and load them right onto the kindle i can check out a book from my library at midnight if i want and have it just doesnt get any better than that,like 23 a week
1.0,didnt like it i had to return it,one star
1.0,my granddaughter is 12 and loved the book kellies diary i bought her for christmas unfortunately the rest of the series are only available on kindle kindle was having a deal where it was only 5059 i bought one for her so she could read the rest of the series and any other books she wanted after all the digital books are cheaper she can put what she wants on her wish list and this grandma will oblige her she had the kindle for a week before the screen frozen i have sent it back will go one step up and get ther the hdx fire 6 and see how that works ive told all my grandkids that if they read i will always buy them a book if they want,screen froze in less than one week
2.0,this kindle is very hard to use everytime i sit it down the pages flip back and forth it is always changing the size of the words it just drives me crazy like the first kindle i got i started using it again,when i bought it i read wrong and thought it 
2.0,i had an old originaltype kindle with the keyboard at the bottom and the screen messed up this new one is more like an ipad touch screen cloud storage etc i asked and asked about getting the categories books games etc transferred to the new kindle no help there i was told everything will be available no its not i dont care for it the actual reading screen is a little smaller all my books are in the cloud my categories are gone and none of my games transferred i have been unable to get any real help from the customer service people they only speak broken english and dont understand what i am asking about and put down in their notes a problem that is what not what i said at all the games i had were scrabble kindle word games and solitaire games ive tried to purchase new games but ive been unable to get them for the new kindle everything is for the older one i cant even find where i had customer service add the new device and mark the old one as gone deleted etcif youve never had a kindle this would be fine if you like an older kindle it is not the same i have an ipad and wonder if i would be better off getting the kindle app for it,this new one is more like an ipad touch screen
4.0,this is a good deal for the most basic of kindle devices you can flip the pages reasonably faster than previous models although i have seen it lock up and need to be reset after flipping the pages blazingly fast as was claimed to be able i was also surprised to see that it had no speakers or headphone jack i have come to expect those as basic features on a kindle aside from that it is pretty easy to control and the users manual and tutorials do a good job of explaining how to use the basic controls the screen looks clear and has good contrast and there are several fonts to choose from one thing that was annoying is that if you turn off the wifi to conserve battery power it complains and asks for you to connect for nearly everything besides selecting a different book i also would like the freetime setting to include the ability to store things besides direct kindlepurchased electronic books such as pdfs and other documents,good for a cheap ereader
5.0,i love reading but i am consumed by a digital age i spend so much time playing video games and on social media i hardly give myself the time to sit down with a good booki have a phone a computer and a tablet each with access to the kindle app but the lights can often cause extreme fatigue when reading for long periods of timei could pick up physical copies of books and read those but often times the font is too small for my bad eyesight and larger books can be hard to read due to the pages curvingenter the kindle this ingenious little device fixes every problem i have experienced with digital and physical readingbecause it does not light up i do not experience the same fatigue as when reading on my other devicesi have the ability to increase font size all the way to the point of each letter being about 12 tall the flat design makes it easy to read in any position i can even put it on a tablet stand and read handsfreeit is extremely lightweight and does not cause my arms to become tired like large hardcover books do in some positionsthe library of books is incredible i can read almost any book i want though there are many that are not yet on the kindle storethe battery life is phenomenal i havent charged it in 2 months and am just now getting a low battery alert it takes a standard microusb connectionover all this is an excellent device and encourages reading in the digital age,excellent for people with poor vision
5.0,i already have a larger kindle but i wanted a smaller one to carry around for when i have to wait somewhere this one fits the bill i just got a soft sleeve for it rather than a case like my other kindle because i wanted to keep it light and simple it has some extra features like share which i do not use i read the instructions to figure out how those features work and how to avoid them because i dont use them this is one powerful reading machine in a small form i like the lack of a physical keyboard on this model because i rarely use the keyboard feature and not having a physical one reduces the size and weight of the unit in less space than a paperback i can carry several books depending on what reading mood im in well done amazon,a great reader in a small form
3.0,updated review after 6 months the touch screen is getting touchy it doesnt just turn a page it may skip pagesinstructions suck but once you figure it out it works fine a lot of help posted on google doesnt apply to this model i like being able to adjust the fonts easily this one doesnt have a back light so its not going to work well if you read in the dark or low light situations i cant read in bed without the lamp on,nice size not the best choice for low light situations
5.0,this a an excellent little device ive had it for 2 months and i love it i have used a paperwhite and thought it was excellent and would get one of those if i wanted to spend that much but for the price this represents an excellent value the design is great and i think it feels higher end the touch screen is wonderful and the lack of buttons gives it a clean look that i really like the battery life is likewise amazing and is measured in weeks as opposed to hours or days i prefer the eink display over that of a tablet because it helps with eye fatigue i always get headaches if i stare at a tablet or computer screen for too long but dont have that issue with the kindle in short if you want something to read books with buy this device you wont regret it,great for reading books
5.0,i had a first generation kindle and broke it this past summer i really like the touch screen on this one i am enjoying the 30 day free trail of books as well my 11 year old daughter really likes the option of pushing on a word and seeing the definition when reading so happy with my purchase,i really like the touch screen on this one
4.0,grabbed this when it hit a low ball price on amazon and have not been disappointed my main kindle it the color one but his one is great as a grab and go and i like how much longer the battery lasts and enjoy the ability to synch my reading progress across both machines and several books,super capabilities for the price

1.0,most worthless pos scam yet sold on the internet you buy a book for nearly the same price as the paper version but you can only dl it to a select device and you cant transfer to other devices i cant transfer my collection from my laptop to the new tablet i got without rebuying the whole dmned set and supposedly amazons been working on that yeah for over two years now and the morons cant figure out simple data transfer yet i got ripped off by the product and again by the books to read would have been better off telling these ahats to shove the retarded tech up their tailpipe and stuck with the paper versions,actually deserves zero stars

5.0,i am tickled pink i love my kindle fire hd 89 i really do but and these are really big buts for me1 it is heavy to pack in my purse like really excruciating after an hour2 it is a battery hog and that is an understatement3 even with the amoled screen the glare is piercing to my eyes in bright sunlightthis little reader solves every single complaint i have with my fire i still will use the fire at home and at night the fire beats thisthe screen even under direct light has no glare it is like looking at the page of a paper book battery life wow and is it lightweight uh yeah furthermore the touch screen means you can easily read with one hand and turn the page what more could i ask for a light yeah but i have my fire for thatthe only drawback i can honestly see is that when delivered mine had a small smudge this drives me nuts so they are replacing it i think the screen might be kind of fragile so i am buying a case to protect it,ahmazing
5.0,i bought the kindle for my son who has dyslexia being able to adjust the font is very helpful for him i sent a request to amazon to consider adding the dyslexia font to the kindle and you did this font is really miraculous for people with dyslexia my sons reading speed is about twice as fast with this font and his love of reading is multiplied by about a million also we have 3 more of these kindles for the other readers in the family and we all love it i didnt think i could make the transition from paper but i might like the kindle even better its so light in my hand and the appearance of the screen is very similar to paper personally i wouldnt want one that is back lit since it would be like reading on a tablet which i think is wearing on the eyes after a while and is stimulating rather than relaxing when reading before bed thank you again amazon,thank you amazon
5.0,i ordered the glarefree kindle basically to use outdoors since my kindle fire is very difficult to use outside because of the glare on the screen this simple kindle has exceeded my expectations its very lightweight making it easy to slip into my purse and take anywhere it connects to my other kindle so i can read from either one and it will know my location in the book i would highly suggest it for the person who loves to read outside to enhance the kindle experience,great outdoor reader
3.0,the ads are annoying and the only way to retrieve the book one is reading is to turn the machine off and then one is able to swipe the ad away if this kindle is for a senior citizen do not purchase as it is confusing on how to get rid of the ad instead of just leaving the book and able to turn it back on later to where you left off there are annoying ads to bet rid of my mother is 80 years old and cannot figure out how to use the kindle without my assistance in hindsight i should have purchased another kindle type without ads,the ads are annoying and the only way to retrieve the book one 
3.0,got this as a replacement for my keyboard kindle which died of old agethe prossmall and light enough to fit in my purse print is clear and easy to read and customizable so you can pick the font face and size that are easiest on your eyesthe cons1 not really in love with the touch screen it seems really sensitive ive blown on it before to remove a crumb and the page changes the kindle tends to get turned on in my purse and when i take it out to go to lunch it is on a completely different book and the font size is either huge or tiny as it gets touched by things in my purse2 another meh to me is that the screen can apparently be bruised if something touches it too hard theres a small smudge on the screen that is not removable its not really in the way but its in the perfect location to make me occasionally look at a word twice3 and finally i am so not in love with the interface making a collection is time consuming and confusing and some of my books for whatever arcane reason show up in the book list multiple times i cannot make it stop i dont know if this is specific to this hardware of if its a universal problem but its really annoying when trying to organizeoverall not bad i like that its not backlit since i work on a computer all the time and can get eyestrain wish i had my old keyboard though if you get one get a case though and be ready to rebuild your collections i wish amazon would create an interface on their website where you can create your collections that would transfer to a new device when an old one dies creating collections on a touch screen is a pain in the tail,got it as a replacement to my keyboard feel a bit meh about it
4.0,its been over a year since my kindle paperwhite quit on me and i havent read a book in that time even though i love reading when i saw this for 49 i decided i get it so that i could hopefully get back into reading instead of spending all my free time online it came with a month of kindle unlimited but i havent used it enough yet to comment on it ive had it a few days and ive only read one book so far which really wasnt that good but this does remind me of how much ive missed having a kindlei wish i would have found these when my grandpa was alive as he loved old westerns and had a massive collection of books it was getting darn near impossible to find him a western he hadnt read and i think this would have helped out a lotreading on this is so similar to looking at a piece of paper in a frame its almost eerie it still fascinates me and if it wasnt for having to tap an edge to turn the page and accidentally tapping edges while im reading id forget i was on an electronic deviceyou need light with this one just like you would with a regular book but i cant say that is a downfall as like i said its the same with a regular bookthe only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is that sometimes when id tap to turn the page it would turn multiple pages and id have to start scrolling back to find where i was atall in all its a good product at a good price and im pleased with the purchase,even though i love reading when i saw this for 49 i 
1.0,i loathe this device when you dont intend to touch it it does something when you do intend to touch it to turn the page or go back or get a definition it does nothing since amazon is now only offering touch devices i believe i am done with kindle readers as the multiple kindles that i have die off i will use my pc andor my ipad to read kindle books that is assuming that amazon works out the bugs in those apps failing that i guess i will go back to physical books it was nice while it lasted but amazon has gotten too far off track for me,not good
4.0,the kindle is a great product i really like the touchscreen interface and how easy it is to move back and forth between pages and books the organization system is nice and i like having access to the unlimited library for 10month i ended up buying the adfree after purchase because it really was a little annoying id recommend getting that right offthebat my only major complaint is that to turn the kindle on when its been off or asleep for more than a few minutes you have to hold the tiny button on the bottom for a solid 1520 seconds its kind of annoying but not enough for me to give up the benefits of the touchscreen i hope they fix that in the next iteration,touchscreen is great readability is awesome ads were annoying power button is a hassle
3.0,i am not a touch screen person and find it hard to manipulate i have yet to get my settings the way i prefer them i would be much happier with the original vanilla verson of kindle,i would be much happier with the original vanilla verson of kindle
5.0,i like to read but since i am retired i have only been able to afford paperbacks since my eyesight is not what it used to be the contrast and clarity of paperback printing is not consistent and can cause eye strain however the kindle is a perfect answer to my problem the contrast and clarity of the words allow me to read without eyestrain  also kindle books are reasonably priced and i can check out books on line from my local library through overdrive,easy to read
4.0,my only complaint is that you cant adjust the brightness of the back light on the page,four stars
1.0,i couldnt decipher the instructions so ive been winging it what in the world is a wifi,one star
1.0,another piece of amazon crap i have never owned a kindle that lasted more than 6 months heck not even 4 months my latest kindle up and decided today not to connect to wifi i have a dozen things connected to my wifi but the darn kindle decides nah i dont want to connect to wifi any morein the trash it goes why do i try to use those stupid things the android app works great and i guess ill have to stick to that my third kindle in the trash same with the fire tv tried that too was unreliable 12 the apps didnt work but of course why would amazon want hulu to work think about it,another piece of amazon crap
1.0,if you just want a reader it is fine there are no bells and whistles on this model,one star
3.0,i found out after purchasing it that you couldnt download any free games onto it,three stars
1.0,so many kindle types i bought this on sale later to learn it was only a reader,disappointed
1.0,disappointed that there is no brightness control when reading in the dark,one star
1.0,slow,one star
1.0,was looking for something to play games on we returned this item,one star
1.0,it did not meet my expectation had to return it and get a kindle fire,one star
3.0,i dont like the touch screen i miss real buttons i miss the keyboard i have the second generation kindle i say go back to the original drawing board get back to basics and make it the way it was at least you stuck to the real eink on this one,i dont like the touch screen
4.0,i like the kindle but i really should have opted for the paperwhiteon the plus side i do find the fonts crisp and clear and have no problem reading them once a suitable in a size that suits me is decided upon there is a reasonable selection of fontsthe slightest movement of my hand or repositioning in my chair requires an adjustment of the lamps position also i have found the screen far too responsive all too often not meaning to i cause the menus to appear or the page to turn when i had no intention of doing so i also find it rather difficult to discern the titles of books in my library when they are displayed as covers very small images in greyscale are not the best way to find things and i have found no way to alter the size of those images the alternate view of titles is just a list i tend to recognize not only the title but the blurbs which remind me why i wanted to read that book i really wish there was a way to display those covers in larger scalebut all in all i am glad i finally got my kindle have been reading every day and adjusting to the downsides mentioned,glad with reservations
3.0,this is not as good as previous versions i really miss the brightness control but my main complaint is it is just finicky if i move it sometimes it just cuts out and gives me the ads screen and i have to go back in to where i was sometimes its just not responsive and i have to completely reboot it i think this would be okay if it wasnt inferior to all the other kindles i had before and not just a little bit this spontaneous cut out is reminiscent of my cellular service where i cant make a phone call from my living room and have to go out on the back deck if i touch this kindle wrong it defaults to the advertising screen,this is not as good as previous versions
5.0,i love it it is easy to set up and fun to read it lives up to its non glare screen purchasing an ebook was fun and easy did not want to stop reading last night the first night with the kindle it was so comfortable holding it and of course the story that i was reading was interesting but mostly it was the novelty of the kindle obviously my first one anyway the bottom line is that i really do love it and how did i ever live without it for so long thank you amazon for the great sale price too,my first love
5.0,im so pleased i bought this kindle for me its hard to convince myself that a kindle is needed in addition to my laptop smart phone and just hard copy books in general but ive been proven sorely wrong on those objectives i will stop at work sometimes and read from this kindle because my eyes start to hurt from looking at my computer screen all day the special tinted screen is excellent at protecting your eyes and the tablet is small and lighter than most books battery life is long i have gone months without needing to charge mine due to the devices minimal use of batteryas for the functionality of the kindle its better than any hard copy book although it doesnt have the refreshing smell of a new book from your home screen you have the option to select a book you can have more than one book on your kindle at once you can also search for or select a book ad that amazon offers you on your kindle if your kindle is connected to a wifi and buy it on your kindle from your amazon account while reading your book you can tap words and get definitions of the words you can also tap characters in your book and the kindle will give you a quick background on who the character is and their part in the story you can highlight parts of your book as well as leave notes in certain places that you can look back at lateryou can also buy a book on your laptop or any device that you can use amazon on and it will upload the book to your kindle when your kindle accesses internet if you want to demo a book to read a sample and see if you like it amazon will send you a sample for free that you can read on your kindle as well if you have amazon prime there are excellent deals on kindle books as well as a whole library of free books you can read,a worth while investment convenient size long battery life and unique capabilities
5.0,love this reader my favorite part is that you can highlight a character and it gives you a description would be nice if it were personalized to wherever you were in the book do it doesnt spoil anything for you but its not that bad battery life is awesome too it kind of sucked finding a case for it because its just called kindle not paperwhite or anything but i found a nice one for like 5 that was universal overall in very happy with it,love this reader
4.0,this is a great basic reader i love the book marking the dictionary how easy it is to buy and download books its easy to read the ads arent intrusive ive had mine for a week now and i am excited to read againi took off one star for some annoyances for the way the device responds sometimes if you have a book open and the screen locks it doesnt easily unlock other times it doesnt always sense when your finger taps the screen id say this happens about 10 of the time or less its not a deal breaker but it can drive you a little crazyby the way it comes with a cable that you can plug into your computer and charge so you dont need to buy anything extra,this is a great basic reader
3.0,as a basic ereader the latest kindle does a great job i have no complaints for what it was meant to do but there is one thing that bothers me and that is the battery life after only about a week of using it it seems half my battery is drained after reading through 300 pagesnaturally i was thinking that maybe ive gotten a faulty battery there was no manual or technical details in the amazon description to see the battery capacity i then saw some very small wording on the back of the kindle itself to see input 525v max 500ma it hit me ive been using too high of a current to charge my battery and as a result have deteriorated the battery health the charger that amazon suggests to use has a 1a output or 1000main my opinion amazon is pulling some form of planned obsolescence not only is 1a the most common output for a usb charger but its next to impossible to find one with a slower charge im going to end up charging my kindle from my computer whenever im already on it from now on in efforts to keep the longevity of the battery computer usb 20 ports output a maximum of 500ma,less battery life than i thought
5.0,if you want to read books on something cheap but have access to hundreds and hundreds of books you like and not have to carry the physical book this is a great thing to have only issue i had was you must have a light source if you want to read at night i knew that when i bought it so it is not the kindle or amazons fault that one is on me of course you can download the app for your tablet for free i love these things they were designed and built just for me,gotta have thing
4.0,if i had readresearched more carefully i wouldnt have bought this and just bought another kobo no epub that means to read any of my current 1600 library i have to convert them also no pdf the ad at the bottom of the fist screen is very annoying and the ad on sleep screen is annoying other than that it is ok for what it does clear text lightweight good size it has a nice feature where you or anyone you preallow can email you documents to read but not pdf im just rating it down 1 for the ads and not using all common formats,works well easy to read no epub or pdf
2.0,the screen is rather dark and the quality of the ebooks is poor compared to how they look on an ipad bit disappointed overall, rather dark and the quality of the ebooks is poor compared to how they look on an ipad
1.0,my credit was not applied off the purchase as i was advised by kindle tech support i am contemplating returning this device,my credit was not applied off the purchase as i 
3.0,i was disappointed that it doesnt have a light up screen for reading in darkened room other than that its good,i was disappointed that it doesnt have a light up screen for 
1.0,i cant get to the toolbar to turn the light on i have followed the directions and even reset the kindle still no light,i cant get to the toolbar to turn the light 
1.0,i returned the kindle back to amazon the same day it was delivered i am still waiting for a refund to show on my bill,still waiting for refund
1.0,it is stuck in spanish and i cant get it to english it came this way and i cannot resolve it waste of money,waste of money
1.0,if you are replacing an older kindle and use audiobooks bewre this piece of crap wont support them,this piece of crap wont support them
1.0,you get what u pay for which isnt much tried to get my mom into the technology age but she and i hated it,pass up on this one
3.0,would like the paper white better but think it is too late to exchange i will call about changing it,would like the paper white better but think it is too 
1.0,the kindle would not let me download any word games to play i was extremely unsatisfied with it,unsatisfied
1.0,this is without doubt the worst kindle i have ever usedit has touch screen controls that are frustrating to use constantly distracting the reader with unintentional changes caused by the slightest whisper of contact even contact with the frame alone will sometimes result in unintentional activation of some of the features eg change font size on this reader then often requires repeated contacts to activate a wanted feature eg change font sizeperhaps someway to program and lock in some features like font size would make this more user friendly why does amazon would sell such a productperhaps they need some of us to go back to paper i know i look for real books much more frequently nowsteve,promotes reading books printed on paper
5.0,i am new to these ereaders just bought a kindle reader i love it its small enough to carry in a purse even with my nice padded case of course i love being able to download and store a lot of books but ialso love being able to change the font and print there is the ability to book mark a page and change the margin i havent tried reading in the bright outdoors yet because its winter here but i love to read on my porch during the summer so the glare free feature will be nice at first i regretted not having a built in light but reading in the dark with a light is not good for the eyes however that feature might be handy if i am traveling on a plane when i dont want to disturb those around me in a case like that ill just have to get a book lighti purchased a nice padded case that has a sleeper feature that helps me save my place one tap of the lock screen and im where i left off thats right one tap or swipe turns the page lastly the price was affordable i have a new iphone a new tablet and now my new ereader of the three this reader is my favorite electronic device,love this device
5.0,this is my third kindle and i have liked all of them but i love this one my daughter convinced me to get this one and i am glad she did i have ra so books can be hard for me to hold that is one reason i love kindles i love how lightweight this one is i love that if i dont know a word i can just look it up on the kindle before i had to make a list to look up on the computer later and that was a pain i love the screen and how easy it is to use i love that i am not constantly hitting buttons on it weather it is the page buttons or the keyboard or whatever button got in my way at the time the one complaint i have is that there is not a case with a light available for it so if books are hard for you to hold and you understand technology well enough then i highly recommend this kindle for you i think it is the easiest one to use so far but i have never owned a kindle fire,love it
5.0,as good as the original kindle maybe better i had my other kindle for 8 years and i dropped it in the bathtubfried it i love the fact that there is no glare so i can use it out in bright sunlight dont spend the extra 20 bucks for the no advertising because its no big dealits just advertising for other books available that might be usefulsmall great clarity and just a great little device,as good as the original maybe better
1.0,its ok,one star
4.0,my kindle paperwhite stopped working last month for no reasonwhich bothers me but i still liked the product but decided to go for unlit version i thought it would be exactly the same just wo the light but its actually slightly thicker and plain plastic shell so i see why many users added paddingstickers to help grip it had i known this i probably wouldnt have bought this version but since i have it now im perfectly satisfied with it,which bothers me but i still liked the product but decided to go for unlit version
1.0,do not like checking on returning it no light and you dont have audio very dissappointed on this product pages not easy to turn very hard to read ,do not like checking on returning it
3.0,i am disappointed in the quality of this product vs the older generation kindle that i had to replace the materials are cheaper feeling and i already feel like i cant expect this one to last as long as the one i previously had for many years the touch screen is interesting though it takes some getting used to and it can be a bit difficult to navigate,not as nice as the older generations
1.0,i bought it as gift to some one speak arabic i didnt know you cant read arabic books on it so i am not using another piece of junk in my house,bad e book
5.0,i bought this kindle for my 10 year old reluctant reader to keep her focused on reading and not playing games that you get on a tablet or searching the internet by getting her this i know when she has it shes reading and is not distracted by apps and games,very nice
1.0,i was told you could play games on it but since its in black and white it isnt for games i will be returning it and purchase a different one,i was told you could play games on it but 
3.0,i like the paperwhite screen it is easier on the eyes then reading on a tablet or computer it is lightweight and holds a charge forever however it is only really good for text for music books or text books any graphics are virtually illegible,good for text easy on the eyes poor for textbooks or music books
1.0,though it was similar to my broken kindle fire 7 but no back lite noemail music or web just thought white antiglare 6 inches,misunderstood product details
3.0,i never had a kindle before or anything like it and this was a birthday present with absolutely no instructions on how to even turn it on i was at a loss to start with there was nothing i could find that actually told me what type of kindle i had i spent hours on amazon and anywhere else i could find trying to find out what version it was and how to work it no one to talk to no basic instructions anywhere and i was about to just get rid of it finally was able to get it working but the manual was of little help to me because i needed basic steps to even get started your customer service online helped somewhat but still left holes on what i needed to actually use the kindle finally found your videos and they were helpful but when i went back to gather further info the videos were no where to be found it took me 2 weeks before i could finally load and start to read a book not everyone is technologically savvy and some basic instructions in the box would be a great help to those of us who are starting from scratch,or anything like it and this was a birthday present
1.0,not what i expected and there are no instructions to tell you how to set it up it was a waste of money and its still in the box,it was a waste of money and its still in the box
2.0,i got this as a gift bc i won it from a school raffle at first it seems great but the wifi on it is extremely slow and most of the time its not even working if you want to do something simple on the experiemental browser like checking your email or going on to amazon dont even think it will always work because it crashes most of the times and extremely slooowwwww to send your document files over transferring to pdf the sizes and format is all bonkers after it converts for you however if you save your docx as a pdf file and then send it to the kindle its viewable just very very small fonts versus the docx extreme crazy huge fonts lol even then the kindle decides when it wants to save the file and when it will not for instance sometimes i send the file over to the device and keep pressing the sync button to update and show the file it doesnt work keeps saying no new files wth so you wait like maybe when its in a good mood then it will download the file not sure if i got a lemon but this was a brand new kindle out of the box they purchased at full cost other than that their promotion features of this kindle having the easy navigation to skip pages does not work with every file or every book some of them does not allow you to use that feature sadly all in all it was quite a disappointment to think i could use this to study my notes instead of printing out notes to save trees and cost ive read books from here too i do like the older version of the kindle with the buttons at least they are functional unlike this one gets frustrating sometimes,krazy kindle a mind of its own
1.0,this tablet is not what i wanted so returning it its probably fine for a reader but i wanted something for a kid to play on,its probably fine for a reader
3.0,is good,three stars
1.0,5 stars,one star
2.0,did not know it didnt light up would rather have ordered an upgradeit is just ok probably good in bright sunlight,would like to exchange it
4.0,my 5button kindle died so this replaced it i like the touch screen…easier to enter text for searches etc it is a bit thicker than my old 5button kindle though and the edges arent quite as rounded good replacement though,nextgen is pretty nice
2.0,i have the original kindle keyboard and love reading on it but dislike how cumbersome it is to navigate or type using the keyboard and buttons the screen is also so yellow that it can be hard to read im 50 if that helps when i saw the ad for this new kindle 7th gen it said the font was darker and the pictures of it show a whiter screen i was thrilled that it had a touchscreen as wellwell the screen is actually more yellow than my original kindle keyboard also the font used on the home page list of books is so fine and pale that its really hard to read and you cant change it the keyboards home list is dark and clear highlighted sentences are really hard to read unlike the keyboard i was so disappointed to see all this and am puzzled as to why amazon would take a giant step backwards in the nontouchscreen aspectsi also dont like how slippery it is to hold i like to use my kindle naked since it keeps it lightweight the original keyboard had a slightly rubberized back it also looked a lot nicer but that alone wouldnt turn me off the new onei only paid 50 for mine on a black friday special but its going back its not worth buying a new kindle just to have a touchscreen it sounds like the paperwhite is probably a better match for me if it truly has a whiter screen but 119 is way too much for me,disappointing
2.0,i have discovered i am a true bibliophile im just not one that enjoys reading a book from a semi computeri love the feel of a hardcopy version of a great book to read in my hands,give me a good ole hardcover book to read please
5.0,ive had a kindle since they came out and have never been disappointed the main and most important feature for me is to read in broad daylight outside on the patio at the beach in my chair or anywhere beside all of the other features of amazon this is what sold me when my kindlekeyboard screen cracked i went without for a while but decided i missed having my library with me and looked at all the numerous versions of kindle out now not like when i first bought one but it all came back to the ease of reading and the portable size the one feature i always thought the kindle should have touch screen to turn pages this one had so i tried it i love it same clear good reading and the added feature of touchscreen sometimes i miss the free 3g for browsing and downloading books anywhere but nowdays im usually fairly close to a free wifi connection so its not a big deal it also seems that they eliminated the earphone jack and the texttospeach feature on this kindle but i rarely used those features anyway i bought a kindle to read and it works for me i would order this version of kindle again,and have never been disappointed the main and most important feature for me 
1.0,after two years of use my kindle stopped working i was very happy with the product but its very disappointing because now the warranty is over and i had to begin reading from my ipad,a twoyear product
5.0,ive only had this for 2 weeks but absolutely love it so far and this is coming from a dedicated hardcopy book reader maybe its because im reading in a digital format as opposed to a physical one but having the kindle makes me excited to rrad again its super light weight and i really like the handy dictionary tools among its other features super happy that i bought this i only wish i bought it sooner  ,excited to read again
1.0,agreed i would not buy this solely because it doesnt even come with a power adapter thats poor business practice as far as im concernednot to mention horrible customer service,no power adapter
4.0,i really miss the kindle that was not touch screen this is fine and i can read clearly but occasionally i touch the screen or it gets heated up and clicks when i dont want it to it works fine but its mildly annoying,mildly annoying for a heavy reader
3.0,it was a birthday gift i really wanted one with a builtin light not happy with it but my husband didnt know about a light so now im stuck with it through no fault of kindle,no builtin light
5.0,i bought 3 of this i like it better than the new ones the new one has glare direct light to my eyes make my eyes tired easily kindle 6 glarefree touchscreen just like reading books without the weight of a think book we all love it,just like reading papers no direct light to my eyes
1.0,if i had known that i could not get the interactive games on this kindle i would never have purchased it it is really a waste of money all you can do with this is read books,not at all satisfied with this a waste of my money
5.0,i really never saw myself as wanting one of these type devices ive always been a hardcore real book person however after reviewing this particular device and catching it on sale 59 i decided to take the plunge i love this reader it is very simple and straightforward easy to navigate ive not purchased any books yet but did borrow a few from my public library transfer rate was very quick amazon is the middle man on this so you do need an amazon account to borrow bookssome of the reviews i read mentioned that they did not like the touch screen vs older versions having buttons personally i like the touch screen the other issue folks talked about was the device not having a back light again i dont see any problems with thisthis unit features 8 different font sizes 6 different fonts and 3 different display settings for line spacing and margins respectively i did some tweaking to suite my personal tastes and have been very happy with the way i can read the size is just about right to be held with one hand the screen is easy to read once you get it adjusted to your liking the battery i cant really comment on yet ive charged it fully but not sure of how long it will last the only thing i was surprised about was the fact that you cannot completely turn the unit off when you hit the power button on the bottom of the unit you are given 3 options cancel restart and screen off i have been using the screen off option the unit has a nice feature involving a dictionary if you touchhighlight a word you will get a display screen from the on board dictionary complete with definition of the word there are also links for wikipedia and goodreads to name a few for these you need to be connected to wifi this wasnt very intuitive there is a mode called airplane mode in the settings when you are in airplane mode the wifi is disconnected to connect simply take the airplane mode offas with any device you have to take in to consideration what you want to device to do for you for me i chose this not only for the good reviews but because i was only looking for a device to use for reading books not surfing emailing etc this is why i chose this and not a tabletthe only additional purchases i needed to make an have done so were for a case and a power adapter this unit comes with a usb charging cable but i prefer to use a regular wall power adapter i found one marked down at walmart for 10 the case i did find on amazon and will review that separately,i love this reader
3.0,cool device but no back light no text to speech reading no apps and decreased battery life just makes this device feel like a big step back without an equally large price cut,cool device but no back light
5.0,got a kindle on the amazon prime sale for my book worm wife my oldest 9yr old dayghter whom we have tried to get to read all summer stole the kindle and has been reading nonstop she gets up to to read now she even uses the built in dictionary to try and learn unknown words and highlights them for us to teach her the word later if she cant figure it out,got a kindle on the amazon prime sale for my 
1.0,i sent you a review on this item already it was such a scathing report i dont believe you would want another i will say that amazon was prompt in its refund thank you,i sent you a review on this item already 
3.0,my kids showed some interest at first but now they are not using it i think its because it lacks backlights so you cannot read it in the car or some dark places and sometimes its screen flickers one per every 6 touches now i realized that the backlight at least is an option that you definitely pay some money to,my kids showed some interest at first but now

4.0,features its awesome being able to select words and have them defined and amazing that you can select a characters name and it will tell you who that character is this helps me a lot when i get names mixed up its also nice being able to adjust font type and size and see where you are in the book and how long you have left to readtouch screen works great better then expected typing is no problem it is some times annoying when you turn a page not intending to though this can happen easily sense this touch screen seems to respond to any pressure not just finger tips so anything that touches the screen and pushes down on it will turn the page i knocked a star off my ratting because this can be really annoyingbattery life incredible i have not charged it sense i got it and its been 10 days i read every day for hoursergonomics looks good and feels good its possible to do page turns with 1 hand and i do it but its not ideal normally you have to use your other hand to touch the screen to turn the page but this hasnt been a problem and i feel reading is much faster with this with a real book i find my self turning over in bed to read the left page then turning over to read the right page but with this kindle i can lay any way i want and read with out adjusting also with a real book sometimes your arms gets tired but this thing is so light its not a problemglare i have only had issues with screen glare twice and both times it was indoors but for the most part the anti glare screen works great even outside in the sunbook marks its easy to book mark a page and you can book mark as many spots as you want and jump to them at anytimegetting books its actually harder then i thought particularly when it comes to sharing books maybe i am just still learning but nothing was as straightforward as i had hoped i had to have my friend who owns a kindle walk me through how to get a book she shared with me and i had to do it all on my computer on amazon i wish when someone shared a book with me it would just pop up on my kindle saying so and so share this book with you accept wouldnt that be so much easier,pretty good

5.0,i love this device when they first came out i was against them only recently after watching some videos by others did my interest get peeked enough to write out a procon list the ereader won by a lot yes the regular book is very special and unique a classic always but the ereader makes it more efficient and user friendly the device is very light weight and easy to hold compared to regular paperbacks and hard covers two of the best qualities for this device is 1 it can hold several thousands books no more bulk carrying or having a hard time deciding which book to bring with you out of the house you bring them all 2 the builtin dictionary and online wifi ability to search further on words terms and phrases pricing for ebooks tied for pro and con as some books can be very cheap while others either the same or more expensive than the actual book but the other pros outweighs this cons in the end you will save money throughout buying your collection you will also never have to buy an addition copy due to losing the book giving it away or damage that can be very easy one book i had bought 4 times due to poor binding style but now i will never have to buy again id highly recommend the ereader to anyone it doesnt mean you will never buy or read a regular book i still own books but mostly all my fiction and smaller novels are on ebook format while picture books and larger history study or research books i buy in regular format,best alternative device for books
4.0,fired this up for the first time it charged quickly i havent had a chance to rate the battery life yet dont bother with the 20 usb charging adapter i used the standard 5 v one that came with my android phone and it worked perfectly with the usb charging cable that comes with this kindle the screen feels different in texture from my first generation kindle fire more texture less glossy i do like the eink although the way the text dissolves when i turn a page takes a little getting used to not a deal breaker books download off wifi just as fast as they do on my kindle fire so no noticeable difference there i like how light the unit is was pleasantly surprised at the experimental browser under settings i was able to read articles from the bbc and check my fb page it is a slow browser and of course everything is in black and white or gray scale however it will allow me to check my email top news and social media in the remote small towns of the maritimes as long as i can find the local public wifi spot since i expected only an ereader that was a pleasant added value i left off one star because i think it is switch and bait marketing on the part of amazon to offer a kindle at a good sale price and then not ship it with a part needed to charge it that happens to cost as much as the savings from the sale price,mostly impressed
1.0,i got this device as a gift and now find that amazon charges too much for digital books i thought when i bought the paperback i would get the digital copy since the website said begin reading now,ebooks cost way too much
2.0,reading on a kindle has become a tolerable experience pages flip with relative ease and there is a minimum of page refresh distraction unfortunately absolutely everything else about the experience ranges from annoying to impossibleon the hardware side the capacitative touch screen is insensitive and imprecise attempting to highlight text for example is a fiddly affair with the position of the cursors especially the endpoint often seemingly placed at random adjusting the cursors to the desired start and end points can be difficult even impossible every action seems to move at a snails pace my original ipad almost five years old now is a speed demon in comparison wifi connectivity is slow cantankerous and sometimes unreliable regardless of the actual signal strengththe software is a mess full stop it is slow ugly and violates just about every usability protocol for example important functions are often nested several layers deep because the menus are context sensitive a desired function may require several extra steps to access as it is only available in certain contexts the exact opposite effect context aware menus are supposed to have the software keyboard is particularly slow and unresponsive and its spelling suggestions can be bizarre forget a passcode or parental control password you have to reset the entire device which includes reregistering the device including reentering your amazon password going through the how to guide a step which cannot be skipped and readding all of your content manuallyamazon freetime unlimited which i subscribed to for my daughter is perhaps even less well laid out than the full kindle experience further the books included are rarely of any quality skewing towards product tie ins and lowrent graphic novels adding books from my full adult library which should be easy requires entering the parental password twice for no reason whatsoever after all the user has already entered the password to edit a freetime profile why should it be entered again to add booksin conclusion i dont expect this review to change anyones mind least of all amazons after all kindles keep selling and amazons selection of available content is nigh unbeatable if all you want to do is carry around a library and read its tolerable for any other purpose the headaches and frustration mount i couldnt for example imagine using a kindle for school where functions like highlighting and note taking become more important perhaps by the 15th or 20th generation the usability and responsiveness will rival a first gen ipad or for that matter my long departed handspring pda one can always hope,unbelievably clunky hardware and software
1.0,not at all pleased,one star
5.0,love it love it love it im enjoying my new kindle very much i enjoyed the older one with the keyboard as well but unfortunately it was stolen out of my bag at the west palm airport purchased this one and its great getting used the much smaller size of the overall kindle but its much easier to carry in my pocketbook and i love the touch screen feature as well great job amazon as usual,love it love it
1.0,the device does not work as advertized the touch screen does not sensitive enough navigation very poor and there is no way to customize or program interface for my personal view turn on and off takes too long i do not recommend this device to my friends i would try to exchange it for the better one,navigation very poor and there is no way to customize or program 
4.0,item came quickly with amazon prime made for it citron covered which i will review separately just opened it set up was a breeze five minutes i did expect and hope the screen would be a bit brighter than my old gray screen nook but i knew it didnt have back lighting im new to readers having only had the one other fore mentioned this item is small and light weight just what i wanted i can drop it n my purse or carryall and never be bored again on buses breaks appointments i was disappointed that books i have previously bought on amazon did not pop up immediately though books on my wish list did that tells you that they were intentionally held back guess like a previous reviewer said ill have to pay 299 each if so thats trifling of amazon similar to having pay for some of the older amazon movies on prime to be streamed to your tv thought i could save and not get netflixi did not order the bllack cover with my order i checked first to see if they had any of the colors left that were advertised with the item dont know why they offered only black with check out i waited to order the cover afterward after being sufficiently convinced it was the same one for protection of the device i took a chance and did not buy the protection plan love the 59 dollar price glad i didnt shell out the 79 price last monthduring set up amazon introduces you to a number of features of your new device which i found helpful such as highlighting notes dictionarybattery was half full which helped with set up also mostly everyone has a power adapter around so dont waste your money ordering the extra 1499 cordthis kindle is strictly for reading black and white a reader verses a book is better if you need to adjust the print size why strain your eyesalso the lighted background issue can be solved with a light made for readers glad i saved my old nook light but if youre reading in bright light you wont need iti was back and forth nook or kindle as far as i know the nook does not have a screen password so if you accidently lay it on the table and walk away anyone can just pick it up and so to speak leaf through i was pleasantly surprised to find a screen lock on the kindle just numbers so you dont have to remember a long complicated passwordsorry this is such a jumble just trying to post this right away overall i am glad i purchased this although i dont see much difference between it and my old simple nook except for the password protection which by the way still works fine but i buy most of my books on amazon and had trouble getting them on nook i get my barnes noble books on my ipad kindle app but so far not on my device as well as some books i bought on amazon maybe im doing something wrong my ipad is too big to carry around comfortably and too much of a magnet on the bus i checked out the ipad mini which i plan to also get which no matter the size of the ipad allows for reading of all media no matter the source and color but this little light weight kindle no glare has its own advantages carry to the beach or park throw in purse perfect for every day convenience im sure when i discover some of the other features ill grow to love it even more,quick easy set up light weight convenient
1.0,wasted my money,worthless
5.0,i have been tempted to get this newer kindle for a while but i could never convince myself to pull the trigger because i already own a kindle keyboard which ive had and loved for years the prime day sale finally got me to buy the upgrade and im glad i did it has a noticeably higher resolution screen than the keyboard model which makes the screen easier to look at for long periods of time it also feels much lighter weight to me which makes it easier to read in bed when im holding the kindle at sometimes unusual angles the battery has also been stellar so far as i havent needed to charge it after the first charge out of the box and its been the better part of a month with relatively light use its still sitting comfortably at around 50 batteryif i had to make a complaint its that it no longer has the page turning buttons that came on my kindle keyboard its not exactly hard to just tap the screen which is surprisingly fingerprint resistant but this means you have to turn the page with your right hand because the left side of the screen goes back a page rather than forward i also realize you get these buttons with the voyage along with a higher resolution lit screen but for the amount that i read i couldnt justify the large additional costall things considered i am very happy with the new kindle and i feel the upgrade from my kindle keyboard is significant enough to justify the cost,a nice upgrade from my kindle keyboard
3.0,needs backlight,three stars
4.0,i got this for my fiance she loves it it actually looks like real paper this is a great product the battery has lasted for a week and a half so far and that is constant use however i did not like that all my information was already on it including my credit card information if i was going to give this as a gift to someone they would have all my information so if you buy this as a gift open it yourself and take that information out,great product topoftheline very happy
3.0,i am disappointed that it did not have a light in it i ordered a replacement for the one i had that had froze up it had a light so i guess i thought they all did still like reading on it just wish it had the back light for night time,i am disappointed that it did not have a light in it
3.0,would like this better if i hadnt owned the previous version the touch screen doesnt add much for the functionality and i liked the side buttons better thinker and heavier but not bad not having controls on the bottom makes the screen look smaller and off center but that is just esthetic,miss my old kindle
1.0,i returned it,one star
5.0,so my kindle 3 finally crapped out on me it was a sad day since that thing had been handed down to me and gone through a lot it survived drops spills a busted and twice repaired usb port lost buttons and exposure to the elements in other words it was a true workhorse unfortunately one last drop was its untimely end and the screen finally succumbed to the abuse it had handled for 2 and half yearsi was a little weary about purchasing a new ebook reader as i prefer real concrete pages over electronic data but i had a lot of good memories with the past kindle and the thing served me well when amazon ran a valentines day special for the newest generation at a measly 60 bucks i couldnt resistits true ive had the device for less than 2 weeks and its true maybe its quirks will come out later but i dont see that happening the kindle 7 is a piece of technological art its not pretty in that sense but its a work of art in what it does and offersi mean itll hold thousands of books and the battery will last hundreds of hours ive used my continuously for a week and the battery is still more than half full not only that but its touch screen has wifi and is just the right size and speaking of right size the options for text size range from the very minuscule my favorite to the ginormous perfect for when i try to read at the gym its super light intuitive and insanely easy to useyeah it doesnt have a light and yeah its boring black and white but you know what who cares its for books books dont have lights and unless its a childrens book a coffee table time or a collectors edition the novel you just paid 10 dollars for is heavier takes up more space and most assuredly isnt in colorseriously though this kindle is awesome and i havent been happier with a technological device since my iphone 6 sure i predict ill be getting an ipad in the future but until then the kindle 7 is my ereader of choice and worth every penny,worth every penny
1.0,this is junk,one star
5.0,i purchased this model for my mom to see if she would like it not big on new technology as a rule she loves it mom enjoys reading on it even uses it every morning as part of her devotions with her bible loaded on the kindle it is easy to use compact the text display size can be adjusted for her comfort and i dont think she has missed a day of using it since she received it on christmas,mom loves it
1.0,hard to read,one star
1.0,crap device,one star
1.0,my kindle died at one year 3 months it was replaced one year and three months later the same exact thing happened to the new kindle both times it refused to charge  the charging port is poorly installed with an inferior design the only thing amazon had to offer me was a reconditioned one for 110 dollars or 20 off a 17900 model so figure that you will get two years usage out of a kindle it is a disposable product they wont tell you that but if you google the kindle you will find that everyone knows it i am pissed that you can sell something that has failed time and time again and not admit in your advertising that the design is limited why would you not want to fix an engineering problem so your product lasts longeroh i know why you can sell more that way i refuse to buy a new kindle i bought a galaxy tablet shame on you amazon made in america used to mean something no wonder now why our economy sucks,amazon has failed me
5.0,amazon does it again with another great kindle the touchscreen is easy to navigate although i do miss the buttons from the previous generation a little great display and stays charged for such a long time,kindle is great
1.0,my original kindle has been stolen so i read the reviews here and found that i will not buy another kindle until amazon brings back the page turning buttons and the buttons to select items on the screen i dont like touch screens and i dont care why other people do the only value of free speech is to disagree with all of the people who are wrong the touch screen on my kindle fire is extremely annoying because the artsyfartsy frisco designer insists on tiny buttons one fourth the size of a normal mans finger even when there is plenty of room for much larger buttons art or is it hubris has trumped function it seems that amazon is beginning to acquire the habits that drove general motors to bankruptcy they want you to buy what they want to sell instead of selling what you want to buy i dont have to have a kindle i still want one but i want what i want if jeff bezos likes touch screens then he can buy them from himself microsoft wanted to jam touchscreens down everyones throat but lost hundreds of millions on windows 8 join me and vote with your wallet,i wont touch a touch screen again
5.0,absolutely love it i have a kindle fire but could not read it outside even if it was cloudy due to the glare i got my kindle paperwhite and started reading outside all the time no glare perfect for me i love to be outside in the summer when it is nice and love to sit by the lake and read now i can anyone that is an avid reader and loves to be outdoors needs this one,absolutely love it i have a kindle fire but could 
2.0,would be better with back light,two stars
5.0,i purchased this kindle on one of the black friday deals i have six kindles two paperwhites 2 earlier ereaders a kindle fire and this one needless to say i like my kindles this one has the touch page turner like the paperwhite at a much lower price it does not have the lighted display but for the price its really great very happy with it needless to say i read a lot so i always have a kindle ready,needless to say i like my kindles
1.0,no backlight cant use it indoors,returning the kindle 6
2.0,i have to say that the way you have turn off the wifi is really bad to turn off wifi you have to go to the settings and turn on airplane mode come on that is ridiculous not only that instead of having a sliding switch that points to on or off you have a button the button reads on when it is actually off and off when it is actually on not intuitive i fly maybe once every 2 years airplane mode is the last item on the list i want to see when i go to settings connect bad bad bad early kindles way way way better, way you have turn off the wifi is really bad to turn off wifi you have to go 
1.0,bought one for each of my parents for christmas only to find out 2 months later it does not have a light so you cannot read in dark really i have double check specs for even most basic features extremely not happy about worthless,no light wt
4.0,i love my kindle this is my first kindle ever and i love it the only thing i really dislike about it is that the screen is incredibly sensitive and lint always gets caught on the insides of the screen had to give it 4 stars because of those two reasons but other than that i love it its so much lighter than having my regular books especially when it comes to traveling,why didnt i buy this thing sooner
1.0,i did not realize what i was buying you could only use to read books i got this for my daughters christmas present i had gotten a kindle fire for christmas last year and love it can i return this 6 glare free and exchange for something like my kindle fire thank you,can i exchange the glare free for a limited del fire
4.0,i loved my kindle keyboard but it just died i have a feeling my twoyearold stepped on the screen so i needed a replacementthis is the option i went with and i am very happy with my choicebefore purchasing i was worried about the touchscreen – i thought the screen would get dirty from constant touching and that it wouldnt be very responsive compare to hard buttons neither of these concerns is an issue the screen stays clean and the touchscreen is very responsive – almost shockingly so i would venture to say its the most responsive touchscreen ive ever used on any kind of device the pageturn time is also shorter so this device feels fasti will say that it feels quite a bit cheaper than my previous kindle there is no longer the nonslip material on the back which i miss now its all the same hard plastic it also feels sort of hollow and flimsy compared to the solid heft of the kindle keyboard its also kind of boxy still feels nice in the hand overall though and its a pleasure to usefinally and this is purely based on my memory i think that the contrast on this might be slightly less than my previous kindle but its close and certainly isnt an issuethe special offers are not intrusive at all some of them actually are useful eg books i may be interested in useful accessories etc i wouldnt shy away from saving some money and putting up with the offersoverall a very nice kindle for the money recommended,touch screen is fantastic special offers are not obnoxious very nice reading device for the money
1.0,couldnt download my textbook,one star
4.0,i purchased the base model for 79 with advertising and in general i am happy as many have said the advertising does not really get in the way and currently is just for other books and when the kindle is in standby i recently purchased wired to read on the kindle and discovered i need the fire the fire is only 20 more so i am wondering should i have made that purchase instead seems like a great deal compared to any of the tablet prices for the most part i am happy but still getting used the gestures and making mistakes that turn pages when i dont want to overall not bad but seems this space is moving very fast in price and performance, for 79 with advertising and in general i am happy as many have said the advertising does not 
2.0,i prefer the kindle fire,two stars
3.0,i finally needed to replace by 6 year old keyboard kindle and bought this i am honestly disappointed in all the adds so many adds recommendations etc taking up the whole screen though the touch screen function is nice it doesnt feel worth all of the advertising pop ups,disapointed
1.0,dont waste your money,one star
4.0,ive been on something of a minimalist kick as of late envious of those adhering to the 100 or sometimes even less things challenge to eliminate clutter live more simply avoid retail therapy etc the kindle has been more or less on my radar since it came out but around christmas time last year a special promo sale on this the most basic model finally caused me to pull the trigger for the cost of a few books or to be fair the cost of the last technical book i bought i thought this was a very smart buy not only did i have a number of pdfs and kindle books i had already bought but i wouldnt worry about my things count or clutter level when continuing to buy booksthis reader is the most stripped down of the kindle line possibly ever though it does include a touch screen the form factor is good its the weight and dimensions it should be the display is good im surprised when im asked about eink type displays many more people than i would have guessed do not realize the difference between a screen like this and phoneipad display amazon probably doesnt help this matter by selling both backlit and androidderived tablets also under the kindle name the screen is worlds easier on your eyes than the laptoptablettv lcds were all so used to the text can obviously be adjusted to where you like it this must be a godsend for people who would ordinarily seek out largeprint books which are special orders and obviously not available for every bookthe touch screen functionality however is not that great its just not what were used to which to be fair is on much more expensive devices like the ipad while it works especially for opening books changing pages and such its tedious if you try and use it on the browser for example the way you might on a tablet although its not perfect id probably rather have this over a physical keyboard a la the early generation kindleson that note the kindle includes an experimental browser i think its quite literally called the experimental browser even which is a good way to manage the expectations of anyone using this feature its an utterly charming way to surf the internet if you ever wondered what the web would be like on a compact bw mac from 1991 here it is for me it tends to crash a lot as well but when its working properly its pretty cool seems to have a good amount of trouble connecting to public wifi that sends you to a portal page i havent looked into kindlefriendly web sites yet but i remain intrigued by this feature and glad its therethe battery life is excellent one of the best features for this in a world where noones anything is ever charged the features this particular model lacks only serve to prolong battery life i also appreciate that when connected to a computer this shows up as a drive and files can be dragged and dropped store purchases just show up when the kindle is on wifi and purchases are directed to send them there a wise choice considering how frustrating apple is with regards to the way itunes is required to manage those devicesall in all i am really happy with this product,i thought this was a very smart buy not only did i have a number 
1.0,i find it very disruptive while you are trying to read by font changing sizes or something popping up with movement of the kindle i read for relaxation not for more stress please return to the buttons i also liked the way you could archive your book once you read it so only the books you havent read were on the kindle i have read the instructions for use and still havent figured it out for this model i would not recommend it,kindle 6 inch
3.0,getting used to it,three stars
5.0,i love my new kindle is the first ive ever owned so i dont have anything to compare it to and therefore no complaints it works well for me and i dont think it moves slowly at all i dont mind the special offers because they dont interrupt your reading experience and only appear on the locked screeni like that there is no back light because they tend to bother me and give me headaches however the screen is darker than i expected so i bought s clip light so i can read in bed its a little heavier than i expected but i love it and im reading again like the recommendations too i really have no place to store books so its great to have a library without having to find somewhere to put it i wish i could buy one for all my fellow straphangers on the n train,get a kindle and read instead of talking on your cell phone on the train
4.0,bought this kindle for my nonkindle husband to use he had been using my fire hd and had difficulty with glare i hated it when i wanted to play on the fire hd and he was just reading so i picked this one up at a great price very happy with the tablet as he no longer has been complaining of eye strain headaches it is the low end of the kindle line but is a great product for the price we can take it with on vacation and not worry so much about it it reads well and does everything that we need it to do,great product for the price
2.0,my appetite stopped workingcant charge it anymore,dont work
5.0,amazing i love the kindle the new design is wonderful for children too its about the width of a standard pencil and weighing only 6 ounces there are no bulky books to carry as with all kindles the kindle 6 is a dedicated ereader meaning children will stay focused without the distractions of a computer or internet which i think is a great idea also most notably you can comfortably read the paperwhite in bright sunlight without any glare which is one of the biggest advantages to using an ebook reader compared to a iphone also i love that the amazon book store has there books so cheap like 99599 for some books the screen is front lit led lights along the edge of the display shine down onto the digital page not from the back of the screen like many other ebook readers and tablets do so over all i dont see any cons in this e reader and its budget friendly as well i recommend this to anyone that likes to read many books but at a great price as well i recommend this for ages five and up,great budget friendly e reader
3.0,it is small and i wish it had a light on it,three stars
5.0,i bought this to supplement using my ipad mini as a kindle i had resisted buying a kindle over the years since i had been using my iphone and ipad to read my kindle library i enjoyed the fact that i could read in the dark and ignored the fact that the sun created blinding glare to me the trade off was worth it though i liked the fact that i only needed one electronic device when i was on an airplaneto me it was the best of both worldsrecently i needed to rethink my stance on a kindle though a situation came up that required me to leave my ipad and iphone behind so i ordered a kindle fortunately i ordered it when they went on sale for christmas so i only paid 59 for it what a bargainsince i received it i have been extremely happy syncing it to both my home wifi and kindle account was easy downloads are lightning fast this is probably because all it does is show books no email or anything else to slow it down reading on it has been a breeze you can customize both the font and font size navigation happens by touching one of the edges of the screen there is a built in dictionary for words i am not familiar with overall this is the perfect gadget for reading in addition the black and white rendering of pictures in the books is excellentthe kindle is very light so it is easy to hold for extended periods of time it is similar to not the same as the new paperback book size so it is easy to handle there is also the added benefit of it not closing in the middle of a paragraph it synced right up to everything else so i didnt loose my place in any of the books i was readingthere is a built in web browser i played with it for about 2 minutes and have never looked at it again it was slow and the graphics are lacking this one doesnt play music take notes have a voice recorder or anything like that there is no built in light despite the background being pretty white this is the bare bones modelif you want an ereader this is the model i would recommend if you want a way to browse the web and watch movies as well as read a book take a look at a samsung or an apple tablet this is the one duplicated electronic gadget that i wont mind taking with me on a trip it is so light that ill hardly notice it is there,perfect ereader
3.0,i regret that i didt buy kindle that has light,i regret that i didt buy kindle that has
5.0,love love love this kindle i bought two because of the sale one for my daughter and one for me my daughter loves hers and i cant put mine down it is such a nice size that it can fit into almost any size purse it does not light up but it never claims to in its description plus having no back light is so much easier on the eyes the touch screen is nice and my daughter and i are having fun with the word wise and the dictionary it is also nice that it holds your spot i can jump around to different books and not have to worry about what page i was on i love that it is just an ereader and that you cant go on any social media with it it helps you read more by being less distracted by different apps i also didnt want my daughter having access to the internet i just wanted it to help give her more of a love for reading not something with games and apps we are so in love with our kindles it does everything it claims we took them out side and had no glare worked perfect i also love that the books are cheaper and we can carry all our books on this little device i highly recommend this kindle if all you are looking for is an ereader if you are looking for a tablet than this is not for you,better than i imagined
1.0,you cant change brightness screen to dark,cant change brightness in screen and almost useless
5.0,ive been debating about getting a kindle for a long time and finally took advantage of the sale around mothers day i am thrilled with this product i found the first review that was named most helpful really make up my mind i didnt know if i wanted the paperwhite with the buttons and the built in light but the review was so helpful that i chose this one and am not sorry i did sometimes my eyes are sensitive to the light in the computer and was concerned about that so i thought i can just as easily use a clip on light if i want to read in bed with husband sleeping the prices for reading materials are so much less and i am still learning about getting books from the library etc its so easy to use and i havent had any problems tapping the screen to turn pages etc its a simple device to use and great to take along when i have appointments or just want to read i love that it is lightweight i only wanted mine for reading purposes and didnt want all the bells and whistles i have nothing negative to say about this great device i wish id gotten one sooner but i did save money on the sale if youre debating about getting one for reading books i highly recommend this one read the one review that is titled know what you are buying i found that so helpful,sometimes my eyes are sensitive to the light in the computer and was concerned about that so i thought i can just as easily use
1.0,too small returning for kindle fire,one star
3.0,theres two ways to review this as a standalone product or comparison to a nook eink reader of the same size ill mainly focus on the comparisongood syncs easily with amazon and prime features open up free options the background on the kindle is slightly lighter than on the nook that offers more contrast but really is a matter of personal taste whether you would consider that a good or bad thing ive read for hours straight on both and suffer no more or less eye strain on either charging the kindle is easier and more universal than the nook the nook requires nook specific charger and even micro usb cable to work properly while the kindle seems to work regardless of cable or plugging into a number charger typesless than optimal i have yet to find a battery percentage on the kindle the nook has the icon and an easy way to get to a screen that shows what percent of the battery life remains that little icon on the kindle doesnt offer enough information to know whether you have 30 or 5 leftpage numbers the nook automatically calculates how many pages your book has based on the font and size you choose and then gives you a display saying page x of y the kindle gives you different options including page but it doesnt give you page x of y itll give you page number and x complete which again lacks specificity like the battery meter the nook has a touchscreen like the kindle for page turning but also has 4 buttons that can be configured for one handed reading and page turning without have to touch the screen i typically read with the item resting in my left hand which means to turn the page on the kindle i have to bring my right hand up and either swipe or touch the right side of the screen with the nook i can set the lower left button which i can reach with my left thumb to turn the page forward so my right hand can hold my drink or shoveling chex mix in without worrying about dripping spilling or getting the ereader grubbysimilar screen size case size although the kindle feels lighter i dont have a scale for these light weights and i havent checked the specs on both to compare but it does feel lighter the nook on the other hand has more of a rounded back which gives it a softer feel again that is personal preference on whether you would consider that a good or bad option in either case i dont have big hands and they both rest comfortably for long periods of timethe kindle is a solid performer but if comparing to the nook id give the nook a slight edge in the area of form and function when it comes to searching for books the next in the series and some other software type areas the kindle wins especially with prime,comparison
1.0,impossible to read due to grey screen,one star
5.0,amazons customer service is fantastic the first kindle i ordered was stolen off of my porch and amazon replaced it for me no charge the kindle works great and i normally hate touchscreens id write a longer review but there are so many books id hate to take away time from reading them,the kindle is great but
4.0,is good but has limited possibilities,four stars
3.0,the screen is great and it works quickly but it is not as functional as amazons earlier kindle touch some of it is just a greater familiarity with their older version but a lot of it is a loss of functionality for example it has no audio capability now takes a couple of different menus to shut off wifi and an extra swipe to actually turnon the device which i dislike it is a nice basic ereader which is what i wanted but it is a shame that kindle actually seems to be moving backwards in terms of their device capabilities and design,not as functional
1.0,get a paperwhite this thing is rubbish,buy a paperwhite not this pos
5.0,i just got this in the last week but so far im in love with it its easy to read on the letters are very crisp and its easy to turn pages i dont have very large hands and its the perfect size kind of like an actual book but thinner i like that i can buy books straight from the kindle and dont have to go and plug it into my laptop to sync it fits easily in my purse or bag and seems pretty sturdy i waited a really long time to get an ereader because i just really like reading on paper better im glad i waited because this version is really great i still kind of get the feeling of reading on paper and my eyes dont get tired like they do on my ipad or others so far its been a great addition to my bookshelf,but so far im in love with it
5.0,can this be read in the bright sunlight,outside reading
2.0,i was addicted to thread words and a few other word games on my old kindle when it broke i thought this model would be a comparable replacement this kindle does not support any games i am so disappointed also it is a different size so i guess i just have to throw away my nice leather cover with light i miss my old kindle,does not support games like thread words
5.0,just got my kindle today and it is perfect it came with all my account info already set and all i had to do was download my books and sign into my goodreads account it is a much better reading experience than my phone and the screen is easy on the eyes it charged quickly and the touch screen responds well i was very glad i got the version without offers as the screen is too small to find ads not bothersome it was certainly worth the 20 to not have to see any ads from the moment i opened the box,solid buy
5.0,i purchased this kindle to read books it does just that it doesnt have any other featuresi own a tablet that i use for the other functions i wanted an inexpensive and convenient way to carry a large number of books with me this fits the bill it is light weight and a perfect size that i can slip into my purse and take it everywhere also if i accidentally leave it somewhere im not out 100s of dollars like my tabletthis kindle is perfect for reading outside when we are camping i struggle to see my tablet in the sun this kindle is not lit so you cant read in the dark i dont tend to read in the dark so it is not an issue for meit all depends on what you want to use it for if you want a way to just purchase and read books this is the kindle for you if you want to surf the internet or read email look at another modelthe last kindle i owned was one of the originals and didnt have a touch screen you had to change pages by pressing a button this is leaps and bounds beyondlove it,love it
4.0,i thought id never stop reading paper books i love the feel of turning the page and the smell of the paper the older the better but i read a kindleonly book on my moms kindle hd and finished reading it on my husbands kindle ereader and i was hooked the display is very easy on the eyes and much better than reading on a phone screen its incredibly portable and is easy to store on my bedside i read a lot more now than i used tothe touchscreen is sort of annoying sometimes though its hard to turn the pages with one hand and if i set it down facedown for a second then there are several inadvertent pageturns and other adjustments when i pick it back up my husbands oldergeneration nontouch version is easier to handle i expect that the next generation will be easier to handle,converted me from a paperback lover
5.0,im a lifelong avid reader and waited so long to get a kindle because i didnt think id like it was i wrong i used to drag a paperback around everywhere 2 or 3 if i was traveling was lost if i finished it before getting home to the stacks of books waiting to be read but i had not been reading for fun in a couple years and stopped carrying a book with me due to business demands and ive really missed it now this just lives in my purse i can grab a page or two or a chapter whenever im stuck in line or a waiting room or out to eat alone turn it on im back into the world of the book at the place i left it i love it im back homeive had this for about 6 months and have only had to charge it about once a month my only regret is that i did not get the paperwhite so i could read it in darker rooms easier without having to turn lights on or use a booklight i think that will be my next gift to me i know i wont be without a kindle again,i didnt think id like it was i wrong
5.0,this is my very first kindle i was really not sure what to expect when i ordered it i had always just read books but i saw how much cheaper e books are and thought i would try it out i did a lot of research trying to find the kindle that would be best for me i dont need a back light or buttons that turn the page when pressed so this very basic model was perfect for me i am very happy with my purchase and at only 79 this is a steal,my first kindle
1.0,my kindle has been mostly a frustrating experience mostly because i find it impossible to turn back a page or two without losing my place entirely i have reset restarted etc countless times and find it impossible to get any help from amazon,frustrating experience
3.0,replaced my original kindle which i thought was great this one not so much the touch screen is too sensitive close the protective cover and the page changes if i dropped something on the screen i have to shut the kindle off in order to clean the screen dont know how but the kindle regularly changes the font size sometimes larger sometimes smaller it was much more convenient to have the forward and back page on both sides of the page its difficult using my left hand to advance the page original software allowed me to organize my books for me my wife whats next to read whats already been read etc although the new software has collections books are in multiple places amazon took a simple useful product and added too many features just because you can doesnt mean you should,not as good as the original
1.0,difficult to download sliding screen not great do not like,one star
5.0,this is a great basic reader it has no bells and whistles it is not in color and you cant play games or watch movies on it which is just what i want it is small and compact and i can take it with me almost anywhere it is easy to setup and easy to use when you purchase kindle books you can have them delivered right to it which is great its no glare screen is so nice compared to my ipad which i had been using to read i can read it at the beach on the bus in front of a bright window really anywhere there is no backlight but a simple reading light can help with that i highly recommend this reader to anyone who wants a good basic reader,great basic reader
2.0,why did i pay for something only to be bombarded by ads really,pay to look at ads nice amazon
5.0,i love this kindle its slim compact and so light to hold its great to be able to read clearly when im outside with no glare reflecting off the screeni previously read books using the kindle app on my ipad mini but now i realize how bulky that was and on sunny days i had to tip the ipad this way that to try and find a way to read with no glare that doesnt happen with my kindlethis kindle does not have a backlight but im fine with that as i dont feel the need to read in the dark,love my new kindle
1.0,im used to a pad thought i would try this and hated it,and hated it
4.0,nice e reader i do have some thoughts for amazon though i work with the elderly and have taught them to use the basic kindle a lot of them cannot get used to the new touch screen models they often hit multiple pages at once cant figure out how to get to the home page or ge to the book they want to read you maybe losing some of your market,nice e reader
1.0,you need instructions to read the instructions argh,one star
5.0,i love how lightweight and small this kindle is its the perfect size for reading on the go or even just lying in bed almost like reading a small book the glarefree touchscreen and eink combined are very easy on the eyes and allows for long better reading without headaches or eyestrain,i love how lightweight and small this kindle is
3.0,see comments included under user guide ,three stars
1.0,i was misled by your rep when i requested an item as much like my kindle touch which quit working and he suggested a kindle fire i told him i already had a kindle fire and he suggested a kindle 6 the kindle 6 i discovered after receiving it was not able to play audible books this is not a small difference to me in the comparison of a kindle touch and a kindle 6 i sent it back and found one on ebay, your rep when i requested an item as much like my kindle touch
1.0,ordered it by mistake so i returned itsorry,one star
2.0,not backlit so how am i supposed to read in bed,two stars
4.0,its for christmas so i really havent used it,four stars
5.0,first off i bought this at a great price 49 during the 2014 holiday season deals i am very happy with this purchase i have to admit i havent read many books in the past i didnt seem to have the time or want to sit and read a clunky book i normally get my reading fix from the internet or articles from a newspaper since i bought the kindle ive found myself reading more and wanting to read more booksthe kindle is light weight and simple to navigate at a little over six and a half ounces the kindle is easy to hold with one hand and when im done it disappears into my cargo pocket the touchscreen is very responsive and after about five minutes i knew all i needed to know about navigation and settings setting up the wifi was a breeze even with password protection downloading books and pictures were fast and simple even while using my horribly slow satellite internet service as for the special offers included with my kindle i thought that when i bought it id be seeing adverts popping up everywhere the only times ive seen an advert was while it was in standby mode so i dont have a problem with amazon showing me a few random things from time to timeanother great thing about the kindle is the battery life ive only had to charge it once since i bought it and that was 27 days ago that being said i turn off the wifi when im not downloading books or syncing i also only read about an hour or two a day so results may vary for some buyers really the only thing i could wish for the kindle is a microsd slot i know that it has cloud storage but i really would like to have multiple sdcards for multiple genre categories it would be nice for my personal preferences all in all this kindle is great and ive recommended it to a dozen people so far im very happy with my purchase and i will continue to use my kindle for as long as it lasts,perfect for my needs
3.0,very easy and nice to read lightweight and size is great the one with light is really better but plastic cover is too soft and breakable so you must take extremely care or buy an extra cover for make it durable,great product to read but take extra care as too soft and breakable
1.0,this product was advertised as 4999 order 11531348756279403 but this on my credit card r 9999,one star
5.0,my husband has been reading ebooks on his iphone with the kindle app he asked for a kindle reader for his birthday because we already have apple products i didnt want to get the kindle fire we dont need android as well as apple so i decided to go with one that is only an ereader instead i have the paperwhite and i love it because i will sometimes turn out the light and read in the dark so i dont keep my husband up he isnt likely to do that though so i decided to go with the base model it has good resolution of the words and is easy on the eyes now he can start borrowing more books from the librarys ebook selection,birthday gift
1.0,ok the product showed up broken customer service couldnt get me a replacement in time for christmas,product was damaged upon arrival
5.0,wonderful readerwas surprised at how lightweight it is i love reading and this little gadget makes reading my books easy and super portable i was able to pick up a nice little black cover for it to keep it nice and protected travels light fits in my back pockettrick to the battery life after opening your book of the hour place on airplane mode,loving it
1.0,worked one day then light went out no reason look elsewhere pay more but you times worth more,one star
3.0,my older kindle died on me and this was the cheapest and simplest replacement unit i could fine i was used to using buttons to turn the page access the menu etc this unit has screen sensitivity while it is much faster than the older kindle i find that it is difficult to avoid inadvertent screen touches that change the page or change the fond or something else the surface of the frame front and back is smooth and slippery it would have been very helpful to have used a rubberized surface,ok but difficult to hold use
1.0,the kindle is worthless to me because i cannot download books and amazon help cant help,one star
4.0,if you want a good e reader this is just fine no glare on the screen as with a tablet it is not lit in any way so you need to read it like a print book with lighting responds well to touch so turning pages is easy as is looking up words and notes i downloaded a shakespearean play and the notes were underlined for easy reference you can access the notes and translations to modern english with one touch i havent used xray yet download is quick even with a soso internet connection the device is comfortable to hold i have mine in a booktype casepro easy to read screen comfortable and light easy to navigate responsive reasonable pricecon no audio for audible books no internal light may be a con for some but not for me,if you just want to read with it its a great choice
2.0,i expected that this would be higher quality can barely read the screen it needs to be brighter with better resolution,disappointed
5.0,bought this for our 10 yr old daughter for her birthday she just loves it she really loves the kindle free time function of it where she can earn badges by meeting reading goals as a parent its great because you can decide which books are available on kindle free time and there is a password required to leave kindle free time essentially you can control which books they have access tothere is also a parental controls section where you can turn off options such as access to the kindle store you can limit or exclude access to your personal library so kids cannot access your adult booksbattery life is great controls are super easy its all touch screen it also has a builtin dictionary that doesnt require wifi access,great for parents and kids
2.0,the kindle itself is too small and lightweight it is not user friendly,new kindle
4.0,the kindle is light weight and easy to handle i have had fun going to various ebook sites and browsing ive found quite a number of free books i like not being a techy it took me a while to get the hang of it i think it is going to be a lot of fun to own,the kindle is light weight and easy to handle
2.0,cant read in the dark wish it had a screen i could read in the dark,no light
5.0,amazing dedicated ereaderfirst off i want to say that i had complications syncing some books that arent directly from amazon initially i downloaded them to my computer and then transferred them to the kindle via a usb cable but this did not sync them to the cloud in order to sync them you must email the file to your kindle this will then sync the books to your library you can find the email of your kindle by going to settings device options personalize your kindle under sendto kindle email it will display the email you should send your books to once you email the files they will automatically load onto your device and sync across all devicesso far i am impressed by the device and will probably enjoy much more reading in the future being able to just have the book with you in a few seconds without having to obtain a physical copy is really usefuladditionally its also really useful being able to tap and hold on a word and having its dictionary definition pop up,great device in order to sync nonamazon ebooks email the file to your kindle
1.0,i love my old basicmodel kindle and ive refused to buy any higher version as much as i covet the paperwhite display and do you know why its not because im cheap its because i hate touchscreens i want to press physical buttons i do not want to get my greasy fingerprints all over the very same screen i am trying to read and now youve gone and taken the buttons away it looks like when my current kindle dies ill be shopping for a refurbished old model and not buying new even though id willingly pay a premium for the buttons i want do you hear me amazon i will pay more money if you take the touchscreen away keep that in mind the next time you decide to upgrade your merchandise,bring back the buttons
5.0,bought this as my wifes valentines day present she had an old kindle that was so primitive it made me cringe watching her use it yhis kindle is easy to operate and the pages are white just like the pages of a novel or magazine i am going to buy one for me,my wife loves kindling
1.0,no whysper sync feature was a disappointment very easy to set up,one star
1.0,there is no case with built in light offered that will work with this device,warning
5.0,these kindles have worked great with my kids as parents our favorite part is that we immediately logged each one we received into kindle freetime and had the books wed already assigned to their profiles show up you know safe books not the plethora of free erotica floating around amazons cloud sheesh we then got to snicker as we watched our kids whine and complain that they couldnt get into apps like you can on the kindle fire and play minecraft 247 were evil like that a minute later theyd figured out the simple touch screen commands and found the books and then they disappeared to read some of their favorites blessed blessed quiet thank you amazon,no you cant kill zombies but you can read
3.0,five months and many books later i havent changed my opinion of this kindle reader i would gladly trade it in for an earlier modelmaybe im old school but this kindle is inferior to my older one1 i miss the page turn paddles that made my previous kindle so easy to read i now have to touch the screen in the right area to turn pages2 with my old kindle i could dive deeper and deeper into the dictionary and pop out when i was done with my new kindle i get a first level definition but no ability to define words in the definition or link to related topics i also cant type in words to explore as im reading3 my new kindle is subject to unintended interactions via the touch screen i dont know about you but i often read before i go to sleep or more precisely as im going to sleep this means that i may interact with the screen when my fingers slip or my glasses fall off or i too often jerk awake and discover that the font has been adjusted to microscopic or gigantic or that ive paged forward or backward to some indeterminate point in the book im readingoverall i preferred the previous kindle whose screen broke when i dropped it on a hard floor as i fell asleep i dont think the touch screen has enhanced my reading experience overall,kindle touch screen not an improvement
2.0,i was very disappointed i spent a lot of money for a black and white unlit kindle my son got one for almost half that was lit in color and many more features this was truly a waste of money,i was very disappointed i spent a lot of money for a 
4.0,unfortunately my last kindle got left at a hotel that refused to send it to me that bad review went on another site so when i went to get a new one i had to go with the new touchscreen version not that its badits just different i like my kindle as simple as can bei use it to read books and nothing more and had no issue using the side buttons the finger swipe took a bit to get used to the new kindle is also bulkierdue to the touch technology im sure but i liked the light sleek design of the last versionlastlythey say pages turn much fasterbut if anything the page turn feels a bit slower to me and after using the device only a couple times its already been freezing on me a bit at the base of it the kindle is still the best ereader out there in my opinion and when this one eventually goes either through technical failure or loss ill surely get anotherbut ive gotta say i do miss the last generation a bit, hotel that refused to send it to me that bad review went on another site so when i went 
3.0,it is totally different from my sony the icons are all there but hidden i am having a very hardtime adjusting to it as a matter of fact have thought about returning it,it is totally different from my sony the icons 
4.0,i have owned a kindle keyboard for the past 3 years and have really liked it but i started getting black lines on pages and have to flip back and forth to get rid of it since i am unsure how long it will chug along i decided to bite the bullet when this was on sale i will say that the pages are much easier to read on this kindle and can even read in sunlight which i had trouble doing on my other one this kindle is much lighter but i actually prefer it a bit heavier touchscreen very responsive but i do prefer the physical buttons i realize that everything is going to touchscreen and most folks prefer that but am of the aarp generation and change is not always my friend i did find that i kept accidentally turning pages at times so i got a case which seems to help and adds a bit of volume which feels better to me since it is so much smaller than kindle keyboard one of the definite improvements is that apparently your collections are kept in the cloud so when i have to eventually replace it wont have to spend all that time reforming my collections my one big complaint is the reading progress option my old kindle has small black vertical lines along the bottom so you can see progress in each chapter this kindle gives the options of locations time left in chapter or book or nothing hate the locations option since it means nothing to me how about an actual page number option as far as the time left in chapter it is way off it currently shows i have one or two minutes left of reading but still have at least 6 or 7 pages left apparently my kindle thinks im a speed reader extraordinaire these are just minor annoyances and i can easily live with them since its so convenient and easy to use battery life is very good depending on how much im reading charge can last for one week if reading a lot or a lot longer if not reading too much battery will drain much faster if you leave wifi on so i just turn it on occasionally to sync or to download a book setup is very easy just make sure to have wifi available and know how to connect to it or you will be really frustrated i would also recommend getting a cover for it to keep screen clean and help prevent you from accidentally turning pages1218 update well i dont know if just coincidence but i received an update today you now have the option for a page number thanks amazon,pretty good
1.0,i hate it had to buy a light just to read it i didnt realize what the back lighting meant and it was a gift so i really really hate it buy something else,i hate it
5.0,i am completely in love with this product of kindle its not bulky and not even of odd size you can hold it for hours and feel just like you are reading the book the text appears just the way you see them in a book its glare free and i was amazed to see it and read in it because i hate reading the ebooks and was against buying it but my husband insisted that we should atleast try it to see and decide and now we literally fight to get our turn to read on this amazing device one more thing the charge of this kindly device is for days its been 4 days and u have lot charged it and i read for almost 2 hrs dailyi strongly recommend it,perfect for bookworms like me
2.0,i am a little blind and have little knowledge of wii am a little blind and know little of its usages i need more time to get used to it,i am a little blind and have little knowledge of 
1.0,wish my old kindle hadnt died because this 7thgeneration version is awful first unit would not access the network second would not hold a charge this does work but the users guide is totally worthless for starters it cant be accessed if the unit isnt working yes i can go to the computer and the online pages if i am at home but the online pages are worthless toousers guide doesnt answer a lot of basic questions such as how to make the reader show page numbers instead of locations or time remaining to finish the bookdownloading books or other items from the cloud to the device must be done one item at a time even at 30 seconds per item for my 263 items thats more than two hours so im supposed to download just what i want for the next few days but i paid for all 263 items and i dont always know which one im going to want two days from now so im supposed to buy a 3g unit which can access the network when im away from home why didnt amazon tell me that before i paid nearly 100 for this version and why should i have to keep spending more and more money to access what i have already paid for for me its back to hardcopy books except when im going on an overseas trip and by my next overseas trip ill have investigated competitors in hopes of finding one that is truly customercentered and less exploitative than kindle,expensive hunk of junk
1.0,how could you not have a brighteninglight feature we assumed this was standard and ordered this for our son please add that to product specs,how could you not have a brighteninglight feature we 
3.0,not much better than the previous one i had the paperwhite basically same features just reconfigured except for the touchscreen system the buttons have disappeared no problem with that except that the screen is ultra sensitive if you so much as breath heavily on it or try to swipe off dust or hair your screen will change very annoying with the undisplayed menu it is hard to remember where things are but keep tapping everywhere on the screen until you find what you want you spend so much time tapping the screen instead of getting ahead with your reading this is the problem with technology updates just as you have mastered your device it conks out and you have to replace it with another and learn everything about it conks out buy another learn the buttons repeat same with software you have not even used or learned half of when yet another version appears and you feel medieval if you dont buy it,too sensitive touchscreen
5.0,love it,five stars
5.0,no i am not a dinosaur but i do have a vision challenge took me this long to buy a reader because i was concerned it would be harder to read than print on paper turns out to be so much easier to read totally unlike a laptop or tablet screenwish i had bought my kindle years ago i now give them as gifts to my dinosaur friends,wish i had not waited so long
1.0,i like to read at night without disturbing my wife unable to do that with this kindle and i dont like the backlit screens at night glare is too hard on my eyes needs to redesigned to plug in an led case love the eink please fix,no plug in for cover led light
5.0,to be honest i have always been very wary of having any ereader i have found the technology of electronic ink to be fascinating and have been interested in ereaders for a while but i just love the feel and convenience of an actual bookthen my wife won a kindle at a contest and gave it to mei have to admit i do love it it is much easier for me to find the books i want to read and the touch screen makes it easy to navigate the best part is the fact that i can look up works or wikipedia articles by just tapping on a word or phrase i can highlight phrases and bookmark them to come back later which has been very useful in books rife with latin i can translate words of other languages in the same manner and if i run into a word i dont know it saves it to the vocabulary builder so that i can look it up later and actually improve my vocabulary with the ability to scroll through pages quickly it turns out that the kindle is just as convenient to navigate as a book and more convenient when it comes to dictionaries and the like while i do miss having page numbers i like enjoy seeing the percentage of a book i have completed while my ereader will not replace books for me it is a very good supplement to them another format that i will enjoy,convert
2.0,it was not what i needed i needed to be able to adjust the background light a fine product just did not fit my needs,a fine product just did not fit my needs
5.0,came fast easy to use just bought a kindle from amazon love it so cool downloading free books and books for under 200 awesome to have a library going on in my pocket almost said pants smile emoticon i recommend you all get one it is awesome,i suggest you all get one never thought it would be so awesome having a library in your pocket
1.0,i returned my other kindle because it would not charge now i went to charge this one and it will not charge,another dead kindle
1.0,i wish that i could rate the kindle that i received but i cant even figure out to open one of my books,i wish that i could rate the kindle that i 
5.0,i have been a kindle owner for the past 5 years until this past june when my keyboard kindle died and since the price was good and in desperate need to get one again i bought the new kindle and im loving it so far it was fairly easy to work but it is kinda weird not having the keyboard around anymore but it does make it much easier to work knowing there is only one button on the device now instead of 30 or more granted i only had it for a day but im seeing a much improvement in my reading over reading on a phone hopefully this will last me for the next 4 or 5 years and when this one dies i will be back to buy a new kindle whatever that may be,awesome device for bookworms
4.0,i have been addicted to my kindle for years now and im pleased to report that the younger generation did not let me down a few things need getting used to it downloads for example not via the nearly ubiquitous cellular signal but via the internet if youre at home and have wifi all the better if youre in a public space the wi fi may be nonexistent or expensive and may be especially inconvenient for people like me who download a daily newspaper on the other hand im assuming that connecting via the web newspaper readers will no longer be hit with weekly access fees when travelling abroad a fair tradethe device itself is smaller lighter and every bit as agile as my previous kindle the display is crisper and pages turn instantly with the lightest of touch navigation is robust though it takes some trial and error to find all the available functionality best of all the price has gone downonly one carp why exactly did my previous kindle suddenly die after several years of dependable operation planned obsolescence could it have been repaired no matter how nifty the product a long life trumps unneeded innovations,and im pleased to report that the younger generation did not let

5.0,i picked this up used to use as a pdf reader as eink displays are easier for some of the things i do black and white technical documentation i did not intend to actually read books with this i started messing around with it put one of my pdf technical ebooks on it old out of copyright electricians book that google scanned and was actually disappointed with the display performance i rightly suspected the books scan was poor and started playing around with the experimental browser and was instantly reassured of the displays quality then i decided it was time to look at some of the books i got on kindle apps in the past mostly free classics i quickly discovered i couldnt stand to read tale of two cities without the discussions we had in english class back in the day i set out and bought a few small ebooks about some things i was interested in and read them small books i then decided that ebook reading is right for me which i never would have suspectedthe only downside is the experimental browser needs a little work i dont expect miracles but i would like to be able to read news sites without it crashing i didnt expect this feature at purchase but if this were updated a bit so i could read cnn fox news bbc etc without the browser crashing out it would be perfectrundowndisplay exceeds expectations sharper than i imagined sharp as or sharper than a printed pageconnectivity excellent wifi and usb connectivity that works out of the box on a maccontent availability perfect content from amazon and from pdf files can easily be loadedease of use took me a few minutes to learn but perfectbrowser needs work but not really the reason you buy one of theselastly i now love reading i used to be like who has time and space for books now i can actually read and enjoy it,you will regret not buying this sooner
1.0,several years ago i had a kindle which i liked and used often unfortunately i lost it when i finally replaced it recently with what i thought would be the same item i received a kindle whch is smaller more difficult to use and not at all pleasant to work with i shall probably only use it for ordering books rather than as much as i did my old one in addition i was forced to accept a free trial of prime before i could go on im not interested in getting prime it cost more than i would ever save i would return it but i just dont want to go through the hassle,several years ago i had a kindle which i liked and used often
5.0,i was looking for a reader for outside as far as the extras i already have prime so those didnt determine my choice great little instrument lightweight fits in purse bought a cover to protect it found one thru amazon for 20 just to protect it nice cover,recommend for someone that just wants a reader with no bells and whistles
3.0,i expected more,i really expected more
5.0,the kindle ereader makes reading so enjoyable i love being able to hold up this very light weight device without trying to hold pages open at the same time it is so easy to use and i love that i can take hundreds of books with me wherever i go the kindle ereader was a revolutionary device years ago but it still holds up today as a great device even in a world of ipads ipad minis iphone plus android tablets and smaller laptops the lack of strain on your eyes when reading makes this a much better ebook reading device than all the other tablets out there,still relevant in a world of tablets
1.0,i was disappointed that there was no screen lighting to allow reading in dim or dark environments i ended up sending my kindle back and buying the paper white version that includes back lighting 40 more seemed steep for that one feature but i really wanted it that being said i love my kindle paper white,i was disappointed that there was no screen lighting to allow reading 
5.0,after years of debate we broke down and got ourselves two kindles the basic model but 7th gen exactly what we need and wanted no back lighting but hey thats why theres the sun andor lamps right ,love them 2
1.0,very disappointed in product worked for only 3 yrs and now it no longer even charge when i called the support they told me after all you have had the device for over 3 yrs it no longer works suggest you buy another kindle some attitude would not buy any product from amazon with that kind of attitude,called support they told me to buy another after all i had it over 3 yrs
4.0,this review is targeted to those completely new to kindles since i noticed most of the other reviews seem to assume familiarity with other kindle productsmy background for the past five years ive been doing most of my book reading on either my ipad or iphone yes i find reading books on my phone quite comfortable actually the problem with both of them is the light theyre just too shiny to read in bed while im trying to fall asleepeven with the invert colors option turned on it was either get more and more paper books inconvenient or try something else hence the basic kindlei chose the basic kindle because despite reading a ton of reviews i couldnt figure out what was so great about the kindle paperwhite119 or kindle voyager199 compared with 79 for the basic kindle they have more bells and whistles but the core functionality appears to be the same so far i think i made the right choicecons1 it feels very cheap and plastic compared to an ipad but this is not surprising considering the price difference2 the screen responds very slowly scrolling through a large amount of text is painful but in reality this is not a problem since page turning inside a book is really the only thing you need to do most of the time and that part is fine3 if you dont pay the extra 2000 you get ads at the bottom of the home screen but these ads are not too obtrusive i dont plan on payingpros1 the screen is perfect for reading in bed because it emits no light its the same as reading a paperback of course you would need to have a lamp on but i think thats good as i dont think reading in the dark with just the light from an electronic device would be good for your eyes2 you can browse and buy books directly from the kindle warning your account is charged and books download instantly when you click buy there is no confirmation screen this is convenient if you know exactly what you want but its easier to do browsing on a regular computer due to the aforementioned painfully slow screen3 easy to use stays charged for a long timei havent tested their claim of weeks but based on the low power usage i could believe it automatically syncs across all your kindle device all the good things you would expectoverall i think this is good value if you1 read books in the sun where screen glare could be a problem2 want to read in bed and dont like the bright light from from most electronic displaysi cant say if the other more advanced kindle versions are worth the extra money but so far im liking this one,a review for total kindle newbies
2.0,not bright enough,two stars
4.0,okay truth be told i think the best ereader on the market is the kindle paperwhite hands down however i got the regular kindle on sale for 30 cheaper than the current retail so of course im going to get this one instead of the paperwhitethe entry level kindle is not bad and honestly i like this one better than the previous generation which is what my boyfriend has i dont know why some people have a hard time navigating this kindle because i have had no problems with it yes sometimes i double click on a page by mistake but i can easily swipe back and i like how i can touch the top of the screen so i can get to the main menu truth be told i am a slow learner with electronics and i thought this version is easier to navigate than the last version with the last version i had a hard time going back and forth to the main menu and worrying about losing my place not with this kindle and its so easy for me to put bookmarks on this device that way i can flip through different pages and books and go back to where id like to readand i like that this kindle is easy on the eyes previously i was reading on my ipad which was such a pain the antiglare makes it so easy to zip through the pagesother tidbits no backlight kinda wish it did but this is the economy kindle dont expect to read this in dim lighting make sure you download overdrive or your local librarys app so you can send kindlefriendly books directly to your kindle ive borrowed several books that were transferred on my kindle no worries on late fees since the book is automatically returned when the loan period is up i dont know why amazon shows videos of all their kindles hovering over water this thing is not waterproof but i think most people know that you can browse the internet on a kindle but i dont recommend it for some moronic reason i did that out of curiosity and it froze my kindle shouldve known better given that its 4 gbsoverall im pretty satisfied with my kindle i expect to read on it for many years to come,easy reader
1.0,but i dont want touchscreenamazon please please bring back a version without touchscreen ugh please,nooooooooooooo
5.0,i already had the several nooks but after getting amazon prime i decided to get an kindle for the free monthly book loan program the kindle special offers are shown on the locked page the ads do not interfere with reading a book with wifi the books are easily downloaded there is no glare in the sunlight tap the edge to turn the paper nothing easier the added dictionary is great what i like most is the ability to get information on the characters with just a touchupdate 03082015i had stopped using the actual kindle for about a month through prime free book download the book is only available on the actual kindle not through the kindle app on my phone fine but i carry my phone more than my kindlewhen i wanted to go read the book i had down loaded i realized i forget the correct name it took a few minutes to find the bookit would be nice if the kindle had a recent read tab if its been a while the recent read tab will still have the book near the top at the present time the only categories are by recent download author or collectionit is nice that pdf formatted books are able to be downloaded so many authors allow you to get their book free online i download on my phone and send to my kindle it appears as a doc on the kindle and on the phone appother than the problem reading free prime book i am extremely pleased with the kindle so much so that i have ordered the kindle fire for my daughter who preference had been her nook hd,with wifi the books are easily downloaded there is no glare in the sunlight
2.0,sent it back,two stars
5.0,as somebody who is a book lover i have always resisted the readers theres just something about holding a book in your hands and smelling the pages i know im a nerd but with a purse that already weighs more than it should carrying around my current book isnt always feasible that is why i gave in to the social pressure and decided to give the kindle a try needless to say im not disappointed ive had the unit for nearly a month now and while i dont use it everyday i certainly do use it with regularity but i have yet to charge it from its original charge blew my mind while that alone makes it amazing having access to a virtual library in a unit that weighs the same as a paperback book is more than i can put into words i can even change the font so if i forgot my cheaters i can still manage to read the words and i literally just have to tap the screen to turn the page while im still not willing to give up the real thing i definitely consider myself a fan of the kindle,im not disappointed ive had the unit for nearly a month 
3.0,i bought this as a gift for someone havent opened it yet but i just wanted to say that the box it came in had no packing peanuts or padding of any kind just the small kindle box in a bigger box please pack better especially electronics,please pack better especially
5.0,its really sad that a company try so bad to your customers in spain and charge them twice on their cards and make excuses to return the incorrectly charged now we depend on master card,its really sad that a company try so bad to your customers 
4.0,i bought this when it was on sale for 20 off the usual price lowering it to a price i was willing to pay in order to experiment with an ereader i initially had the free offers version but found that often the kindle had trouble waking up from the ads when i swiped to start reading that was very annoying so once i decided that i liked the kindle and wanted to keep it i was really happy to find that i could just pay the 20 difference to have the kindle updated to remove the ads havent regretted getting rid of them since i wish there was a light built in and if in the future i decide i need a new ereader ill probably want to get one with that feature but for now im happy with my experiment i still really enjoy reading actual paper books but i also like reading them on the kindle it always remembers exactly where i am in the book even if i have to check out an ebook more than once in order to finish reading it thats a wonderful convenience i use this a lot on the go since its small relatively light and easy to use my ipad is much more cumbersome and heavy it doesnt go too many places with me any more this kindle will display the pictures in a book but not all that clearly its not made for impressive graphics im okay with that this is just a good basic way to read books if youve been thinking of trying one out go for it amazon gives you 30 days to decide whether to keep it or not,that was very annoying so once i decided that i liked the 
4.0,this kindle replaced my old keyboard style kindle when i fell and it went out of commission i have had this one for about three weeks i love this new version but am having some frustration with the touch screen it has a hair trigger and too often i find wikipedia and other stuff popping up when i only wanted to turn the page sometimes it goes forward when i want to g back and although i consistently set it to the font size i need it somehow changes even when i am sure i was holding it only by the cover and not touching the screen i have been using a kindle for about four years and would hate to do without i assume that my new touch screen kindle and i will soon be comfortable friends,i am optimistic but
1.0,do not like the touchscreen,one star
4.0,great deal on this it still costs more than a fire but this is a touch screen i had last purchased a kindle e reader in 2011 and it was one that had a small keyboard on the face of it as well as audio capability this new one does not have audio capability so totally discounts the ability to use audible on this device i do not like full color devices to read with and for now this will do but i am disappointed that my older kindle died as it was perfect this one seems a bit smaller with the viewing area being smaller than my previous 6 inch kindle i dont mind the touch screen ability but do dearly miss the audio capability,miss my old kindle
1.0,this was an impulse buy on primeday that i wish i hadnt made i usually love all thing technology but i do not like this not one little bit the screen flickers i cant read at night with the light off i am very disappointed with it,do not like it
1.0,i am very disgusted with the kindles with the touchscreen a friend gave me a kindle several years ago and i loved it it did give me good service for years before it finally just gave out the kindle i had you clicked the side either side to turn the page i could not afford a new one so my daughter gave me hers and got a kindle fire her kindle is only about 2 years old and i hate it with the old one i could find the last page i read without any problem this one jumps around or jumps to the first of the book and you have to search page by page to find where you were sometimes when you press to turn the page it doesnt turn the page or skips ahead several pages sometimes i dont even have to touch the screen and it turns the page with my old kindle i could delete books i have already read this one i can not now the only kindle you offer without having to touch the screen cost 199 i thought the policy of any company was to make better products not worse products at better prices not so with kindle,older kindles much better than the newer ones
1.0,do not like touch screen,one star
5.0,i finally got a kindle because i had to take a 3week trip to rotterdam from california i knew i would never be able to carry as many books as i would need especially since we were going to need to carry a number of things back with us it was a long flight with layovers both ways and sleeping was nearly impossible in the cramped planei loaded the kindle with ebooks i had a collection by one of my favorite authors and there are lots of free books to download and i decided to try kindle ultimate while i was at it and packed it into my computer bag it saved my life during the flight and the trip both my husband thinks i should have gotten the one with its own lighting but now that im home again access to a reading light is not an issuethe text is amazingly clearreally my graphics geek husband marveled over itand being able to adjust the size means that even if ive forgotten my reading glasses i can still read they dont always make it from one room to the o read more,the survival guide to overseas flights buy a kindle
1.0,totally user unfriendly ,one star
5.0,ive long been an ereader skeptic however after finally trying my wifes kindle i decided i had to get my own im thrilled with it and heres whytravel i read a lot and i read fast i usually go through a book in the course of the plane flight alone add a couple more books to cover the flight back and the trip itself and the weight and volume start to add up with the kindle i can bring a dozen books and take up less than the weight and volume of onefinding new authors i found my favorite authors by borrowing books from the library in my teens now that im in my forties a lot of them have died or retired and ive read everything they wrote new books are too expensive to gamble with beating sturgeons law and with two kids i dont have the time to get to the library with the kindle i can check out lots of library ebooks without leaving the house and find my next generation of favorites for purchase,i found my favorite authors by borrowing books from the library in my 
5.0,i love the kindle voyager i just have a few questions about it it says i can read it in total darkness and it is smart enough to know it and change brightness i have not seen this occur also it says i can change the brightness myself and i cant figure it out i would like some feedback on this,i love the kindle voyager i just have a few questions 
5.0,i never thought i would trade in my books for an electronic reader but i was given the kindle 6 touchscreen as a gift and i love it this device reads just like a book completely glarefree and the screen has the look of paper friends and coworkers who have the kindle fire or more expensive readers were so jealous of my kindle when i whipped it out during a flight on a recent group business trip it will be perfect for an upcoming vacation to china where i would have otherwise had to pack several books for a twoweek tripone note you will need an attachable lighting device if you would like to read from this in a dark space,perfect reader
1.0,i got this as a gift and it is worthless you can not adjust the light its to dark and can not read anything without eye strain i can not return it because it has been opened i even handed it to others and they said the same thing it is to dark its hard to believe a device in this day and time it does not have a brightness option,to dark to read no adjustment option
1.0,i hate this one i paid extra for no special offers im getting all the ads i called the telephone number to have this removed he went into my computer i gave him the info to remove the ads then he wanted to sell me a safety program for my computer and the kindle i wanted to discuss this with my grandson he said the ads were removed and i hung up the ads are still there my old kindle was so simple i only used it to read books from amazon and my local library this one belongs in the trash can,i hate this one
2.0,too small no light cheap,two stars
5.0,this is an excellent ebook reader i also have an ipad but reading at night often keeps me up because of the backlight i like the design of the kindle because it reads like a regular book and i sleep well after reading it it also reads well in bright sunlight or in areas where there is a lot of glare the pages are easy to turn with the touch screen display naturally it is not as fast an an ipad but it serves its purpose and performs wonderfully compared to older ebook readers the page turns and general operation is faster so it feels more natural,this is an excellent ebook reader
1.0,good my son likes it,one star
5.0,i was looking for a dedicated ereader to avoid distractions from a tablet and the eye strain of a backlit screen so i opted for the traditional kindle the offers are not at all distracting when turning it on and its very responsive and easy to tweak and customize its light even with a cover and easy to read with just one hand on the subway and fits great in my coat pocket i live in a new york apartment and i dont have the space for a ton of books that i want to read so i want to start using the kindle for reading to save space and be able to take it when i travel years ago i traveled crosscountry by train and the weight and bulk of even just a half dozen books was a pain out of 100 books on my wishlist only 2 or 3 are not available on the kindle and are cheaper so i can definitely see this as my goto for reading books,love it as a straightforward ereader
1.0,still too soon to tell,one star
1.0,if you enjoy over paying for what basically feels like left overstock buy this kindleif you want a smaller more legible kindle get the paperwhite i actually thought i was buying that one didnt think these were even made anymoregreat case of buyer beware,if you enjoy over paying for what basically feels like left overstock
5.0,i love this i bought this to read my books outside without having the glare that tablets have and im very happy with it warning though it is just for books thats all i wanted for but just saying it doesnt do what a tablet doesi would highly recommend kindle fire cheap and does just what i need,love this
2.0,i bought this on prime day aka grandmas got for candy for you oh wait thats just sugar free mints day but should have just gone with a paperwhite which would have been nice if they had put that one on sale i bought this one for me and a paperwhite for him this one feels cheap and the plastic on the back is hard whereas the material on the back of the paperwhite is smooth and is almost a rubberized serface also it actually is much nicer to have the light options of the paperwhite the paperwhite feels much nicer and looks much nicer with the higher resolution screen and optional light if you can afford the extra money just get a paperwhite youll be glad you did,the paperwhite is much better and worth the extra 
3.0,its okay but not very handy i was unable to load nook books onto this i couldnt get many popular android apps like nbccom it works well for amazon supported things read kindle books watch amazonprime etc but it was hitmiss for other features i also couldnt get my bluetooth speaker or headphones both are common brand products to synch with this system,lukewarm
5.0,this is my first ereader and i love it the touch screen is so convenient and it keeps my place in the books i am readingits true the screen is not lit from within but thats not a problem for me as i dont like to read in the dark its very easy to operate and anyone could learn how to use it in no time at all im very pleased with this purchase and i will purchase more kindles in the future,great product
1.0,got this as a christmas gift ,yuck
5.0,i love the new kindle book it is small enough to fit in my hand light weight reads so incredibly well and is simplified although i like my kindle fire and my samsung tablet i tend to want to play more games than read with the book all i can do is readand it is so nice to have no distractions the screen is also wonderful i have no difficulty seeing the print regardless of lighting the dictionary works well the xray has been incredibly helpful and i do really enjoy the vocabulary builder i have often gotten the meaning of a word from context as opposed to looking up the word in the dictionary the vocabulary builder has not only added to my vocabulary but has also added shades of meaning to the text thank you amazon for a wonderful product,i love my newest kindle the book
1.0,i shop at amazon all the time and ebooks are less expensive on amazon but am very sorry i moved from my nook i have been in technology for 30 years but am completely baffled as to how this piece of trash works would love to read my books but can download the app so i can read and dont even talk to me about the battery life its non existent what a royal pain will never make the mistake of buying a reader from amazon,piece of trash
5.0,this was much better than i thought it would i think i could have like some better instructions though being a first time kindle users it took some time to figure it out all in all i lover it i would recommend this to everyone this is a kindle to read so dont think you will be able to internet stuff with it like a tablet for those of you that are use to that i can read outside with the sun and lot of light with no problem i got a light light to attach for the dark areas or it could be my eyes,kindle 6 glarefree
1.0,unit description was very poor i wanted something to replace my damaged kindle fire i didnt realize that this is 1 just a reader 2 in black and white only the nonglare display is so dark as to be almost unreadable indoors and the screen does not rotate i am returning the unit for a upgrade tablet,unit description was very poor i wanted something to replace my damaged kindle 
5.0,waited along time before i purchased a kindle i did not think i really needed a e reader when i have at tablet and a pc i needed it lol the reading experience is totally different after working on a pc all day and trying to read on a tablet it gave me dry eyes this is so much better it is easier to hold than my 7 or 9 inch tablet i love the fact it will fit in my purse if you are going to read or any length of time the kindle is the way to go my battery life has been good also after i download a book i just turn the wifi off mine came with a partial charge and it only took a couple of hours to charge it to full,do not wait buy a kindle love it
2.0,usb drive mode makes no sense,two stars
4.0,i love that kindle touch is still antiglare its what i love best about it the screen doesnt hurt my eyes which is very important for me the touch screen is superfast you barely have to touch it its very responsivei only have issues with the font size and the wireless i wish there was a font size between font size number 5 and 6 like in my first kindle font size number 5 is either too small or font size number 6 is too big there is no middle groundplus i wish there was a simple turn wireless off option like in my first kindle rather than the airplane mode otherwise its pretty cool,fast touch screen but issue with fonts
1.0,did not like this one at all,one star
2.0,this model is bit disappointing compared to my previous one with the physical keyboard this model has many defficiencies copared to the old one the worst of which is that it consistently flips pages on own which is very anoying i loved my old kiddle with the keyboard and wish it were still available new for purchase i am not agaist new technology but they went backwards with this one,the worst of which is that it consistently flips pages on 
1.0,it just wasnt what i needed,one star
3.0,the screen is clear and bright as i knew it would be but i miss the one handed convenience of the original kindle where i could hold the book in the palm of my hand and use my thumb to turn the pages this worked great whichever hand you wanted to usethis one definitely takes two hands to use one to hold the device and one to hold the stylus or to touch the screen not the best of solutions for folks with a stroke or other hand use issues you have to put the book down on a table every time you want to turn a page,good but convenience of use is an issue for me
3.0,disappointed that it is not in color ,three stars
5.0,hardware the dimension is just right and it is really light the nonreflective screen surface ensures that this device can be used under various light conditionssoftware it has minimal features and thus is really good for users who are easily distracted by apps etc the sole reading function makes this reader a musthave,splendid
2.0,cannot find the book i want,two stars
1.0,did not fit with my kindle,one star
5.0,this is my third kindle my first was a kindle with a keyboard it was fairly light but somewhat of a hassle to enter information the keyboard letters have worn off which makes it even more difficult to use i got a fire but did not like it as well because it was heavier and the charge port is sensitive and it is very difficult to get the cord in just right to have it chargethis kindle is much lighter and has the touchscreen i have only had it for a couple of weeks i really like it it is lighter and smaller than my othershowever there are a few things i dont like it did not come with any instructions i am not having many problems with this since i owned other kindles but it could be a problem for a first time buyeralso the touch needed to turn a page is very light and sometimes more than one page is turned i havent gone into settings to see if i can adjust this yet so maybe it is not a real problemi would recommend this kindle,my favorite kindle
5.0,i am so much in love with this kindle way more than i thought i would ever be just was planning on using this as a transition to a tablet but now realizing that i wont be buying one at all kindles glare proof easy to read easy to use layout and this kindle made me fall back in love with reading again,can i be the new kindle spokesperson
3.0,i really like this kindle particularly the size however i gave it a 35 because it does not have a back lite almost every reading device does these days and i assumed it would as well i enjoy reading in the dark and really miss this feature my bad i should have read carefully all things considered it was a great buy for 4900 if you do not need the back lite get it,good but
4.0,i usually read my books on my windows tablet or my nook but hated the glare when im at the beach so when amazon had their crazy sale in the summer for prime members i got this kindle for 49 to have just for the beach it is perfect for the beach it weighs about 1 lb if that and it fits perfectly in a quart ziploc bag to keep out sand i download all of my content from my tablet and im good to go my beach vacation was awesome i dont really use this on a day to day basis as i prefer the tablet but i do take it with me to my hair or dr appointments that i know are going to be awhile probably will take with me on my plane ride in january just so light an portable will fit in my pursenote this doesnt have a backlight cant read at night without a light just think of it as a paperback without the paperrecommend for certain applications,hated the glare when im at the beach
1.0,nowhere does amazon say what generation this is digging through the reviews i find it is a gen 7 touch put this information in the damn specsi wanted a lighted case for it i cant be sure any of them fit lighted cases have specs that say doesnt fit this model doesnt fit that modelnever saying what model and generation it does fit i read the reviews on these cases and many people have to send back products because they dont fit wtf put the damn models and gen numbers in the specs of the products advertised on amazoni think the real problem is that amazon has too many generations of kindles and the emphasis is on getting people to buy higher end kindles a paper book is starting to look better and betterfyi i had a older model d01100 what gen that it i havent a clue that i loved but cant replace that is now a paperweight because replacing a battery requires glue removal with a hair drier idioticget your shi together amazon or customers will bail,a paper book is starting to look better and better
5.0,love the new touch screen its lightweight easy to use and small enough to put in my purse and take with me the screen is great i get headaches starring at a computer or phone screen for too long and this screen doesnt do that to me i can read for hours and hours,love the new touchscreen
1.0,does not have a light and not in color,not what i wanted
4.0,i am a first time kindle buyer ive wanted one for quite sometime and after using the app on my phone for years i finally decided to purchase this onei enjoy the touchscreen and dont understand how so many people have a problem with it its not that hard to not touch the screen while youre reading i also like the size and feel of it in my hands i actually like how the back is ridged because i find that it gives a better grip than something with smooth rounded corners one thing that i thought would be a problem after reading reviews was the text many people said it was pixelated and i began to worry that it would be a waste while i dont know the quality of other kindles i find the text of this one to be good and easy to readmy one and only complaint is its not backlit i did order a reading light though so hopefully that will fix the issue,i enjoy the touchscreen and dont understand how so many people 
1.0,my kids cant even play ah game dry are all sad,madness what to do
5.0,i love it i really liked the page turn buttons on my kindle classic and worried i wouldnt like touching the screen as much but the transition has been painless the menu is intuitive and easy to navigate great upgrade,i love it i really liked the page turn buttons 
1.0,waste of money spend the extra money and get a fire,one star
5.0,i love it i got this as a promotion on amazon where they let me split up my payments and im so glad i took the offerim able to connect it on wifi and also i can use it with my overdrive app and download library books to the device the only downside to this is that it dont have a light but i ended up getting a light from amazon that clips on it i still would much prefer a lighted on but i couldnt afford it and im glad to be able to get me a glare free device i would recommend this for vacations and long trips if you are a book lover,great for the beach
1.0,well below expectation poor quality,poor quality
4.0,i didnt like touch screen before but this one is so easy just touch the screen with a gentle press of your finger and the page is turned better than the kindle fire i bought for my husband a couple of years ago i also like that i can turn off and turn on thewifi,kindle 6 glarefree touchscreen display wifi
3.0,no back light must read in a lit area,three stars
4.0,nice device but not the model you want if you love audio books this is a nice kindle fast with no delays with the touch screen but it has no voice nor any speakers so you cannot have it read to you something i treasure in my other kindle and it wont play audio books either this is probably one of the reasons the battery lasts so much longer than older versions up to a month the look and feel is very nice and not heavy at all it costs 25 to remove the ads on it if youd like to do that i took one star off for the shopping cart symbol always at the top of the screeni really dislike this type of thing on any reader i am reading and do not want to be prompted to go shopping by my kindle also there you will find a g for good reads which seems odd to me even though i know it is owned by amazon but then so are many things like audible for which there is no letter this one does have a dictionary and if you highlight sections it will translate them to your choice of many languages it has wifi so you can order a book and download it in seconds while you are sitting in a starbucks or anywhere else there is free working wifi i find it much easier to hold and read in a case and that is the solution to not turning pages accidentally much,audio book lovers should not buy this model as there is no voice no sound nor speakers
1.0,i bought two of these right before christmas as gifts my friends were over the moon upon opening their presents however after complete silence about the readers since then ive finally wheedled it out of one of them that this is so small they dont use them i completely wasted the money i spent on these and embarrassed myself with my friends,an embarrassment as a giftgiver
5.0,i love love love my basic kindle i bought a kindle fire a couple years back because i live in a city and take the train to work every day and was tired of lugging around books to read but i quickly discovered the kindle fire was just a bit too heavy in my purse and holding and it needed to be charged more often than i would have liked so i got just a basic kindle and its wonderful it weighs practically nothing so i can just throw it in my purse wherever im going its nice to have multiple books with me and it downloads ebooks quick and easily the battery life last forever i can go a week or more without charging it if youre a book worm who travels i highly recommend it,i couldnt live without my kindle
3.0,i have not used it enough to rate it,three stars
1.0,dont waste money for this product,one star
5.0,i love my new kindle i bought my first kindle in approximately 2005 have had it ever since its traveled all over the world with me i have never had a problem with it until recently it just did not want to work right anymore i think the switches offon might have finally worn out after 1112 years so i invested in a new kindle i couldnt be happier with it it takes a little getting used to as it is a touch screen rather than a next page bar requires only the lightest of touches to respond i would recommend this kindle to anyone looking for a great stay at home or traveling companion,my new kindle
5.0,my kindle came before it the date given which was an added bonus after tinkering with it for a bit i have come to love it it was easy to obtain the books from the cloud and store onto the device it also has a super simple user interface which is what i was looking for this does not have a back light which i was aware upon purchase but thought that it should be stated the dictionary and highlighting options work well and i am rather impressed with them as well the batter lasts for some time and as an avid reader i find this to be extremely helpful i like to read several books at once and have plenty of options so if you are the same and travel a lot this is something that is wonderful i will update my review after a few more months to see if it stands the test of time i expect the battery life to go down a bit as all electronics but so far i am impressed with this kindle,great product
1.0,i dont like it is small and slow and you send me two,zero ★
5.0,i used to read books on my phone and i was really missing out reading on a kindle is a completely different experience and i love it the screen is a great size and perfectly light to hold with one hand the touch controls are responsive settings are simple and everything is fussfree this is much closer to how one might read an actual book without the interruption of text message and email alerts on pages that look so much like ink and paper and the battery lasts for weeks,i love my kindle
1.0,they are in chinese and i cant get them to english,worthless
4.0,i bought my first kindle touch 5 years ago after it stopped working i decided to get a new one the newest model of the kindle touch looks great i will go over the pros and cons of this kindle and wether it is right for you pros the kindle store gives special prices to kindle ownersbooks are cheaper since they are ebooks yesterday i got 3 books that would cost me about 70 in total for 15 bucks this kindles battery is great with average use about 23 hours of reading per day this kindle should last about 5 days to a whole week its touch amazon got rid of the home button making this kindle completely touch the touch is a bit more accurate than the older versions and in my opinion does not have to refresh as much as muchwhen the screen turns black for a second this pro is more like the first one which concerns all kindle users the classics like hamlet and such are completely free i had to get one of the classics for a class which cost 20 for the paperback its completely free in the kindle store you can get this kindle for a reduced price if you choose to have special offers included this just means there will be book ads which are not at all obtrusive and might even help you find a great new book to read if you i do not know what a word means i can just tap and hold the word and a definition will pop up this is great for reading hard books like the scarlet letter cons screen is delicate a case is a must for this kindle the screen is glare free but if the light is right over you like in a room it will be impossible to read without changing position the displays resolution is not that high and if u focus on the letters you can see the pixels which i dont mind that much but its still a con i guess i do not like that the battery is not removable since it will hold less charge as time passes i really like this kindle but the fact that you cant without light is sometimes annoying i did not write this as a con because there is a kindle with built in lights but its more expensive,a great product for a great price
3.0,i bought this for a friend but he didnt actually tell me if he liked it or not didnt appreciate anything he got for christmas maybe he should have given the darn thing back i would have used it because i love reading i am sure it was super amazing but i will never ever know because i would never buy something this awesome for myself though i am sure that i would have thanked myself dozens of times by now jerkenjoy the gift because its the last one you will ever get from me,i bet it is awesome
3.0,i did not realize that there is no light to it i still find it hard to read it outside in bright sunshine but it makes a great back up for when i need to wait for doctor appointments it fits better in my purse than my larger kindle,i still find it hard to read it outside in bright sunshine but it makes a great back up for when i need to wait for 
1.0,the screen is not lit so you cant read it at night not a deal at all,really poor info
5.0,i had an older model kindle that my son gave me for christmas in 2011 while reading late one night i dropped it and only about half the screen now works i have quite a few unread books in the library and i continued reading one that i was about halfway through on my laptop computer though it is nice to be able to read the books on more than one device a laptop is nowhere near as convenient as the kindle so i decided to buy a new onemy old kindle had a keyboard but i never used it so this model is working out fine for me i wasnt sure how i would adjust to not having the little buttons on each side to flip pages but i have very quickly adjusted to tapping the screen to move to the next page you should know that i am a dinosaur and do not use a smart phone so i am not used to using a fingertip to change screens since this is a much newer model on the home page there are pictures of the book cover rather than just titles listed like there were on the old model they are in black and white but at least a little more interesting than just a one line title and authori pretty much use a computer to decide what titles i want and to purchase them and just use this device to actually read books its great for reading novels or nonfiction but i dont like it for reading textbooks after 4 years of college and 7 years of graduate school i need a real book with paper pages and a yellow highlighter to read textbooks all in all i am happy with the new model no frills kindle,though it is nice to be able to read the books on more 
1.0,so far i am not very pleased with it too small,i am not very pleased with it
4.0,since so many of the reviews on this device are complaints about it not having a light function let me say this kindle does not have a frontlighti would like to use this review to convince you not to buy the paperwite or voyage by comparing things that are important to mereadability i know that this model has almost half the ppi 167ppi as the pw and voyage 300ppi and this is a big selling point for amazon but it honestly does not make that much of a difference when actually reading our brains do most of the work by recognizing symbols and shapes and filling things in so to speak that the text appears very crisp and very easy on the eyes with this device even with the lower ppi not a good reason to upgradereading in the dark the front light is such a gimmick not a good enough reason to upgrade imho since i can buy a darn good book light you know like we used back in the old days for 4 vs an extra 40 for the pw that has the same functionality as this model minus the light i had the pw first gen and the light was really blotchy and i personally noticed that my eyes strained when reading with that bluish white backlight for long periods at a time vs having the book light shining from above this is just a personal preference youll have to decide for yourself which you prefer i will say however that if your partner is very sensitive to light you might want to get the pw since you can turn the light down very low and squint to read that waydesign all 3 kindle models are pretty basic looking tbh not a good reason to upgrade this model does not have the rubbery back that the pw has and is a very smooth plastic that makes it very slippery in the hands i have found that both the pw and this basic model are very easy to scratch and ruin the screen as my keys did when i put the pw in my purse the good news however is that there are so many beautiful cheap cases on this site that remedy this i purchased the walnew kindle 7th gen colorful painting smartshell case the thinnest and lightest leather cover for amazon kindle with 6 glarefree touchscreen and it does not add any bulk to the device and has a textured feeling making it easy to hold when reading cons the basic and pw both have the indented screen that is forever catching dust and crumbs in the corners and it drives me nuts and the voyage is the only model that has the smooth front i refuse to pay 199 for a dedicated ereader thoughbattery life same on all 3 if you go easy on the light with the pw and voyage hasnt been an issue i should mention that none of the devices come with a wall plug but in this day and age honestly most people probably step on these regularly around the house i certainly dont need anotherthis basic model is the definition of good enough for its purpose as a dedicated ereader and since im mildly irritated at the rate amazon is cranking out these upgraded kindles i have made a list of things i consider worthy of an upgrade btw if your thinking about buying an older version of the kindle it is still supported and you can still buy ebooks to send to the devicethe only reason ill ever upgrade1 if amazon finally makes a waterproof kindle for reading in the tub or on the beach i have spilled tea on my basic kindle before and since there is not that many entrances like a headphone jack or something it survived just fine id feel more secure about reading in the tub if i knew it was tested as waterproof though2 if amazon brings back the headphone jack for listening to audiobooks i think they will probably have to make the storage expandable or offer more gbs if they do this since i think audio would take up more space than text if this a concern for you the kindle keyboard 3rd gen does have the headphone jack and im certain you can find a used one around going strongalso amazon seriously needs to get on the ball with the typography also very annoyed that epub is still not supported you can convert ebooks with calibre but its a hassle and that i am only allowed to lend books once for like two weeks,i would like to use this review to convince you not to 
2.0,i hate it that its price fell soon after i bought,two stars
5.0,ive always been a physical book type of of person so i really wasnt sure if i would enjoy the kindle however i bought it for myself and my mother because it was on black friday sale surprisingly i absolutely love it im currently reading the outlander series by diana gabaldon for those who dont know the books average around 1000 pages even going up to about 1500 pages and it has made reading so much easier im a graduate student so i like to steal time for reading for pleasure when i can and trying to manipulate a 1400 page book while eating a sandwich is really hard the kindle is easier to hold no flipping of pages or trying to get the book to stay open and is really easy on the eyes i find that my eyesight previously better than 2020 has worsened since spending so much time in front of a computer thanks grad school but this screen is designed for prolonged periods of reading i really couldnt recommend it more although i will still continue to fill my bookshelves,so i really wasnt sure if i would enjoy the kindle
1.0,not impressed at allwent back to my nook,dont like it
5.0,having been a longtime user of the original kindle which itself was a 5star product without a doubt this later model is even lighter in weight and simpler to use while providing the user with the same screen size and glarefree features congratulations to amazon on the ideal product for travelers and overseas residents who find it difficult to get printed books and for those who prefer digital reading wherever they may be,simpler lighter and even better than the original kindle reader
2.0,ok,two stars
5.0,i was upgrading from an original kindle that ive had for years i was nervous about the touch screen would it be responsive like my click original one i was worried about the extras being accessible such as the type size home screen back button etc however all my fears proved to be nothing to worry about this little kindle is just great just as easy to figure out and use i love it it is a great lowcost reader i still love the nonbacklit option because i am more oldschool as far as i want it to be more booklike i dont read my books on my tableti save them for the kindle,nice reader for a low investment
1.0,i didnt expect glare free to mean black and white also a video poker game i have on my other two kindles doesnt show up on the new glare free kindle there seems no way to speak with a kindle support tech since tour web site or any of my orders show no phone number for said support i am very disappointed eith this kindle now i know why it was 4999,i am very disappointed eith this kindle
1.0,no manual came with it making it useless,could have been good with manual
4.0,bought this primarily to have a non backlit device for reading before bed time as studies show that ambient lighting results in greater restfulness during sleep similar to a book this kindle is this in bright light and low light situations especially at the beach the native browser was a surprise now i have to resist the temptation to check my email while off the clock and on holiday pretty amazing battery life overall even with the wifi on screen refresh is a bit slow and annotating is clunky but given that a change goes for a couple of weeks i am not complaining,the browser was a surprise
4.0,i do love this kindle i bought it after i dropped my last kindle in the hot tub it will not survive dont do it i think it was a 3rd generation so this is an upgrade i like most of the new features although i was really excited to have the xray feature reading game of thrones and its not available for all books and not got i do wish there were more options for nontouchscreen so i could more easily use it in the hot tub more responsiblyill have to find one of those electronic cases with clear spot for touch screens on the front this one weighs a little bit more than my old one but it feels substantial the only issue ive had is when trying to find some plastic that would let the touchscreen still work through it the plastic not only didnt work it messed with the touchscreen and freaked it out a few times but since i quit trying its been fine its also a little bit harder to highlight but with all the new features it was just hard to find and i know i just need to get used to how to use it overall this a great basic ereader definitely recommended and a very good value for the price,i do love my kindle
5.0,the kindle is a worthwhile investment for me as it will help to remove the myriad paperbacks that i own the only issue that i found was accidentally ending up on prime had to shut it off actually the kindle was a bit of a stretch for me since i am a paper book person i do like the cheaper prices for books though and being able to enlarge the print for those most of the day reading sessions,a good investment
1.0,screen too dark and i could not figure out how too brighten it,one star
4.0,i was pleasantly surprised with this kindle ive never had an ereader before so i wasnt really sure what it expect it was really on sale cyber monday on amazon so i went ahead and ordered it to try it outit seems pretty fast and works well the user interface is a bit quirky but i got used to it quickly i wish it had texttospeech capability to read books to me when im unable to look at it but i can live without itthe screen is a little bit harder to see than paper but not too bad sometimes the background seems to have a bit of a yellow tinge to it which is odd and sometimes distracting but not terriblebattery life seems great so far ive been reading it for many hours 810 and its still got more than half chargeits very light and even fits in my back pocket i wouldnt recommend sitting down with it there thoughid say its definitely an improvement over paperbacks and hardcovers,pleasantly surprised
2.0,i cant get the screen page to light up going to send it back,two stars
4.0,after 3 plus years of constant use my first kindle died this was the closest replacement model i wanted one that did not have a backlit screen and one that i could use outside i have a kindle fire and that which is impossible outside on a sunny day this kindle has many features the other didnt have at the same price but if you are reading a book and want to get home you have to make sure you touch the screen in the exactly the right way and in the right place or you get stuck the dictionary or font size or highlight or whatever also pages will jump just by jiggling the kindle the touch screen on the kindle and kindle fire work differently you can drive yourself nuts switching between them,i loved my old kindle i just like this one
1.0,very disappointed with the lighting and how it turns pages,very disappointed
5.0,books bought at amazon look pretty good pdf files are legible but it doesnt automatically resize to the proper screen size in order to display the text better fortunately one can pinch out to zoom in,books bought at amazon look pretty good pdf files are legible but it doesnt 
1.0,returned it as it has no back light for reading in the dark,no back light returned it right away
1.0,i replaced my four year old basic and quite dead kindle with this newer model it is subpar it lags more even with the same connection and is of a cheaper quality there are no connections for a lighted case and i am very angry about it this thing is dollar store quality unlike the one it replaced and if amazon thinks this is a strategic ploy to get me to spend more money on a fancier onewell thats an epic fail ill be returning this piece of crap and switching to nook i am so disgusted because ive been a diehard kindle user since turning to the dark side of ereadingyou failed amazon,cheap dollar store product
1.0,cant read in the dark cant change the font size totally useless in my opinion,totally useless in my opinion
5.0,just got my kindle yesterday and i love it i have tried to read on my kindle fires but the weight was prohibitive due to my bad hand arthritisi love the screen very easy on the eyes i am so excited to be able to read my favorite books and not be in pain this is awesome and i wish i had bought it sooner,love it
1.0,there is no resemblance to the kindle we purchased several years ago i cant get it to work and am very disappointed,i cant get it to work and am very disappointed
4.0,the goodthe matte screen is easier to read than a smart phone so its good for reading in long stretches the touch sensitivity is good the kindle feels sturdy the weight of it feels fine the battery life is fine i dont have to worry about it dyingthe badi wish its case was not as slippery i keep it in a cover so its not a big deal for meit seems book collections made on it cant be imported to kindle for pc which makes it less useful making collections on the kindle isnt funthe experimental browser doesnt work as well as i want it hung loading a site i have read that mobile sites work betterthe user interface could be better a dialog box asking if i wanted something should have buttons saying yes or no not ok and cancel but the ui is usable and its out of the way when reading a bookoverall its good for people who like to read a lot,pretty good
1.0,cannot adjust light or contrastimpossible to see book covers to choose what to readthe product comes without any sort of manualamazon kindle customer service is unfamiliar with this device so no support,cannot adjust light or contrast impossible to see book 
5.0,this was a great purchase i had a kindle 2nd generation that i was very happy with i was reluctant to upgrade over concerns some of the reviewers stated regarding the touch screen sensitivity and clarity i was also concerned about registration and not having access to previous books i had purchased i also had concerns about charging the battery with the adapter i had for the kindle 2 anyway after a couple of months of consideration and a little more research my wife convinced me i should buy the new kindle birthday present and i am very happy i did it works great all of my concerns were unfounded first of all it is much lighter and smaller than the kindle 2 without sacrificing screen size it is easy to navigate using the touch screen and the drop down menus registration was seamless previous titles are readily available on the amazon cloud and the battery charger adapter works fine great product for those who love to read highly recommended,great
1.0,internal light is a must sending this back too dark to read in normal light,internal light is a must sending this back 
1.0,i dont like this new kindle and i m very disappointed in amazon for forcing us to get an inferior product i loved my first kindle and used it for several years with no complaints i dont like change and i dont want to learn about a new reader im going to go back to my local library and read books again im sending this one back and i doubt i will be buying much from amazon in the future theyve lost the faith i had in their company,i dont like this new kindle and i m very disappointed in 
1.0,unable to access my previous account with amazoncom with my new kindle raa,one star
5.0,i bought two of these just in time to take with me on a threeweek vacation since i am now a published author with a book available for kindle as well as a print edition i thought i should get one of these ive been wanting one for a long time this particular model in fact i have loaded all my manuscripts onto the kindle and was able to review them and write notes the experimental browser is well experimental i guess i didnt buy the kindle for the browser so im glad that it had one at all i was able to access facebook my banks website and other sites reasonably well the kindle introduced me to goodreads and i now have my author page set up there so people can follow me and review my book,exactly what i wanted
5.0,i like the idea of not having buttons on the sides of this device i always used to hit them accidentally on other models the display is perfectly clear and high contrast enough to read in any light where you can see well enough to walk around small and light its perfect for reading books the only reason i could see wanting a different model is if you wanted a cellular connection for downloading books where there is no wifi,simple reliable inexpensive
1.0,maybe its because of my weak stomach but this thing literally made me sick,one star
1.0,worst service i have ever received from amazon and it will now determine if i ever buy a kindle again the dedicated e reader kindle is shown as a paperwhite unless you read the very fine print that shows the 79 one is not actually a paperwhite it is just a regular kindle with touch screen the advertising is completely misleading here and i was on the phone with amazon for over 40mins and all they wanted to do was sell me the new 200 kindle or sell me a refurbished kindle for 99 both being the paperwhites i was then transferred over to a supervisor who then started all over again to sell me a 200 kindle very very very poor customer service,kindle paperwhites are all not the same
1.0,nothing like what i expected especially from amazon do not get this kindle,one star
5.0,this review is for the 7th generation kindle which is now touchscreen only and has no buttons except for the lockpower button all typing has been transferred to an inscreen keyboard popup i love mine but some people really like their old kindle with the qwerty keyboard buttons at the bottom in nay case the kindle is a great investment for bookworms with its multitude of features and has

1.0,i cannot make it brighter to even see the written words i do not like it,i do not like it
4.0,first of all i should say that i do love my kindle this is my third before which i had a nook and to date i think this is the best i prefer this stripped down version to the fancier ones because just as with a car the more gadgets and added features there are the more parts there are that may break i would rather just read with the light on in the room than rely on a reader to light up for me i am an advance reader and i go through two or three books weekly the promise of a week of battery power is ridiculous because it doesnt take into account how much reading one does in a given daythose of us with arthritis have been assisted tremendously by the kindle sometimes i select very lengthy works that would be huge if i had to handle the physical book and because of arthritic issues i prefer this version of the basic kindle to the one i just wore out not having the buttons down the side but relying on a touch screen instead is far easier on the thumbs and highlighting by touch is far easier on the hands than having to navigate to each individual letter one click at a time this version makes it far easier to access footnotes and the dictionary but there are some kinks that still need to be worked outi use the features constantly since i am almost always reading a book with the intent of reviewing it the touch screen needs improvement trying to highlight too far left or too far right sometimes causes the page to turn unexpectedly trying to highlight in the topmost 20 causes the tool bar to pop up it is possible to highlight these areas but one has to touch it exactly straight on and hold for a moment and frankly its a pain in the butt in addition the keyboard has a terrible auto correct bar i have an android phone that can guess what i want to type very early but this one has no clue when using the secondary keyboard for punctuation the next word after the space bar is tapped should pop up as the main keyboard with letters but it doesnt we must move it back manually every stinking time and try the bookmark one cannot just tap the upper right corner because that will either bring up the tool bar or cause a letter nearby to be highlighted the only way to use the bookmark therefore is by first bringing up the tool bar then selecting bookmark then tapping a third time to verify that one wants to place a book mark in the cornerfor those that dont often use the features and just want to read the book and have the kindle remember your place its a pretty good reader the text is clear and the font size is easy to change without causing the paragraphs to go out of alignmentthe insidious suggestion that we link our goodreads account to our amazon account is the worst potential invasion of privacy i can imagine i began my toread list which has hundreds of titles with the casual intent to read those books if i ran across them it was never meant to be a wish list of course all i had to do there is ignore the prominent invitation to link my two accounts but its worth notingall told if i were going to buy an ereader again i would still choose this one i suspect it is the best on the market right now but i do hope amazon will also continue to work out the kinks in the features,touch screen great for arthritis but many kinks in using tool bar and keyboard
4.0,helps with the glare but took several tries to get all of the bubbles out,four stars
5.0,finally saw the point of getting a kindle i was using the android app but decided it was time to use a kindle and saw the battery on my phone for other uses this paperwhite is light and unobtrusive no frills and no thrills but it is supposed to emulate a paperback i kind of wish i had the model with the backlight but for the price i got it for on amazons 15th anniversary i cant really complain works seamlessly with your kindle cloud and does everything you need it to battery life is great i havent charged it yet but ive been reading sporadically for 3 weeks,battery life is great i havent charged it yet but ive been

2.0,after making this upgrade all my notes and highlights in my most frequented book have been lost my techie son spent a long time researching this online trying to beat the problem but to no avail whats up with this vaunted whispernet when are they going to learn what a young bill gates figures out long agothat customers care much more about their data than they do about some factorys next new widget disappointedafter submitting this mostly negative review i was contacted by amazon asking me to contact their customer support number after a long discussion with a very helpful agent they confirmed that when books are updated on their system personal notes and highlights are lost they gave me a website where i can go to see them once im logged in httpskindleamazoncomyourhighlights but they will never again show up on my kindle device strangely my old notes highlights show up on the kindle app on my iphone new notes and highlights show up on my kindle but i cannot see all of my notes highlights on either my kindle device nor on my iphonei asked the amazon agent if they never thought of allowing customers to elect to upgrade to newer versions of books they own with the declared risk that they may lose their own valuable data the agent said they will put that into their system for considerationso i reiterate what i said before personal data is more important that hardware if amazon wants us to stick with their hardware platform they better find a way to protect my data in the meantime keep your notes highlights on paper,previous personal notes underlines wont display

5.0,simple ereader i wanted something that was not backlit that i could read before bed since most lighted electronics can interfere with sleep and melatonin productionthe things i like mostvery lightdoesnt get wearisome to hold even after several hoursyou can turn pages with a single handawesome for when the other hand is too busy petting a demanding kitty in your lapholds battery life welli read about 13 hoursnight on average and i have to charge it maybe every two weeksvery fast response for page turnsthings i dont likethere is a bit of a lag from the time you hit the button on the bottom till the swipe to unlock function pops up really not a big dealgeneral slowness of navigation through menus and whatnotbut not in the books themselvesin lowlight conditions i wish the white part of the page could be a little whitermore contrast would make it easier to see but i think this is a factor of the technology and not this device and i think thats just life with a nonlit ereaderoverall i love it my husband also bought one and he loves his as well if you want a simple nonlit ereader i dont think you can go wrong with this one,the things i like most very lightdoesnt get wearisome to hold
1.0,did not purchase this through amazon no need to give a product review,one star
4.0,i prefer the texttospeech feature of previous kindle models i am not a person to just sit and read i dearly love the text to speech because of its quirks and mistakes that the author may make it also helps me with the pronunciation of the off the wall names that the author gives to their characters not all books are available in audible format i do not have to worry that the narrator voice will be unpleasant to my ears this is the biggest reason i do not order many audio books i just do not like the narrator so when you come out with a new kindle that has texttospeech even if only useable with a head set i will gladly buy oneyourjudy,texttospeech
3.0,great but it doesnt have a light and you really need it sent it back and ordered the one with a light,great but it doesnt have a light and you 
2.0,updated review i changed my rating from 3 stars to 2 stars for two reasons first the screen freezes at seemingly random moments when the backward tap and the menu tap do not work until i have tapped forward once second and more importantly the notes function is more difficult to use than it was with my older kindle the one with the button keyboard i use a kindle for two reasons convenience and the ability to increase font size the old kindle allowed font size for notes to be adjusted as best as i can determine note fonts on my new kindle can not be adjusted and i have difficulty reading them in addition the edit and delete labels are very small and it takes several attempts before the note is deleted instead the tap dismisses the note and then i have to go back to it and try againi also have to say that amazon promotes this kindle as having a better battery than the older one no way at best its just the sameas an aside i contacted amazon customer support to ask if note fonts could be adjusted and as usual they did not answer my question but sent instructions for adjusting book fontsoriginal reviewi had an older kindle with the button keyboard and switches on the side it is a perfectly fine device but the switches were starting to opoerate erratically so i decided to buy another kindle and got the 7th generation guy with the touchscreen just your basic ereader it is slightly easier to read on because all i have to do is tap the screen to turn the page but sometimes that seems to hang up a bit what i have a problem with is that learning how to use it is slightly less than intuitive and the onboard documentation is pretty bad the users guide is not indexed and the search function is clunky and lists all the results in a bunchedup sentence not in context if you want real documentation and instructions for how to perform various functions you have to use an online search enginei also struggled with transferring books from the old kindle because i had a lot of my own books on the old device which the new guy calls documents i finally got them all over but it took a while and the new device keeps giving me unnecessary warnings about syncing issues that function worked okay btwon the whole im okay with the new kindle especially as a physical object but the software could use a focus group,it is a perfectly fine device but the switches were starting to opoerate 
1.0,i bought this because my kindle touch quit working i loved my kindle touch because i had a cover for it with a light now they make this 7th generation kindle so that you cant buy a cover with a light for it i have to pay something like 200 for one with a light as i was setting up this kindle all of a sudden my kindle touch started working why before i even ordered the new kindle i tried everything to get my old one to work i couldnt find any help on amazons website so now i have 2 kindles that work this is crazymaking,why cant amazon leave well enough alone with the kindles
3.0,didnt know much about this but it does pretty much what i hoped,what i expected for the price
5.0,i like this new kindle as i am so accustomed to touch screens i was irritated when i had to use a keyboard on my old second generation it took no time at all to figure out home return etc i chose to go with the kindle instead purchasing a kindle fire because i like reading outside and a backlit kindle is the only way to do it they are a special segment of the electronic devices this model is smaller without the keyboard which i like for carrying in my purse on airplanes i didnt like the kindle version of nupro cover that wouldnt stay closed if in a purse hated the feel of it because i would rather be holding a book instead of a tablet so i got one of the leatherlike covers made by elsse it is really nice and has the front flap pocket for my plane boarding passes there was some frustration in amazons writeup of covers because i didnt know for sure if the cover was for the 6 inch display they just mentioned 7th generation and i had no idea what generation it was i noticed they fixed that on one of the pink elsse covers i hope the touch screen works for a long time my old 2nd gen was typing in us on the search bar at the bottom covering up the last line of every page so hopefully this one will last as long as it did many years and many books later,like the touchscreen
5.0,i think 6 is too small for a reader its hard to hold the thing without turning pages and its awkward holding it with the edges but being able to read out in the sunlight is the best and why i gave it 5 stars amazon has made the kindle universe rather convenient for a person that always reads i like the kindle apps on my notebook and phone but i always take the kindle reader with me when i travel,but being able to read out in the sunlight is the best and why i gave it 5 stars
1.0,i would not have purchased if i knew i would be constantly bombarded with ads to purchase books they should have paid me to purchase,constant ads to purchase books
3.0,this is a whole library that i can hold in one hand i love to read but have limited space in my house so it is really convenient to have this ereader where i can access a world of books it has my bible dictionary and other reference materials and i can access almost every book ever published i also find that many books are not issued in print anymore and i have them in my kindle collectionthings you should know about battery life i love that i can read for weeks with a single charge but you have to be careful and use a kindle knowledgeably because there are a few basic rules you must follow to prevent damage to the battery just call amazon kindle help before your first use and they will be able to help you get set up safely you shouldnt over charge and you shouldnt try to use the kindle while it is charging and you should never let it run completely down these things could damage the battery you should also know that a wifi internet connection drains the battery very fast only connect to the internet while downloading a book and when done disconnect from the internet for low energy reading you cannot replace the battery on a kindle so when youve used up all your charges you must discard this device and buy a new kindle i think if they wanted to they could make these to last but there is no profit in that so remember that kindles are disposable and your best course of action is to be aware of how to take care of your battery and give it maximum lifeanother drawback is that kindles are tiny they are not a good choice for cookbooks or for color magazines or for an atlas that needs a large page size to appreciate and kindles are black white only if you want a large screen and color display you will have to move up to a tablet but be aware that kindle reading is extremely hard on the battery life of a tabletone of my favorite features is that this particular kindle is the cheapest because it has no backlight this is considered a negative by some people but i find that hours of staring into a backlit screen causes eyestrain this inexpensive kindle is the easiest for me to read and i wish people could realize what constant backlit screen time does to ones eyesi dont think kindle will ever completely replace print books i still have a small collection of my favorites in high quality hardbound editions but for general reading this is an awesome compliment to my print collection,great addition to my print library but will never replace old fashioned books
1.0,i got this for my sister can it be use with out wifi she dont have wifi in her home,i got this for my sister can it be 
5.0,there is no going back to books this makes reading convenient on the go and while waiting for anything its really lightweight and easy to hold i have small hands so books can actually be cumbersome to hold for long periods of time recommended this to my friends and theyve all bought one and loved it too i read on a night flight and the built in light was perfect because i dont like the overhead lights,great buy
1.0,no back light for night time reading difficult to figure out how to download books,one star
5.0,i received the new kindle as a fathers day 2015 gift from our youngest son he gave me the kindle glarefree touchscreen it improves reading experience in several ways it saves reading state more often allowing me to reliably switch to my old original kindlethat i still use the new kindle is more readable and certain commands are more intuitive it is faster to connect with wifi and i dont miss the experimental ultra slow and unreliable browser in the old kindle however i do miss side mounted pageturn buttons this old feature allowed page turns forward and backward on both sides of the device a feature that ive come to depend upon otherwise i am hooked on my kindles i now read many more books than i had read before i received both as gifts i will not go back to buying paper books i have a library that fits in my house rather than one the requires constant culling amazon makes book buying and reading the joy it was when i was a kid,good and bad in new and old kindles
3.0,the screen is small amazon should provide different options in term if screen sizes,amazon should provide different screen sizes
3.0,i had paper white bought this as a gift but returned because cannot justify giving an obsolete design as a gift especially if its for someone near and dear it was great when there was no paper white i think it will go out of production pretty soon,once you try paper white you dont go back
3.0,i really havent used it enough yet i havent downloaded a book yet still learning,three stars
5.0,this is exactly what i wanted my eyes cant see small print as easily as when i was younger my wrists would be stiff from holding my ipad if i read for any length of time also kindle books on my ipad difficult outdoors due to the glarethis device satisfies those three issues i was having i can easily adjust the size of the print reducing my eye strain the device is deceivingly light a pleasant surprise and i can comfortably read for hours in fact the device is lighter than any paperback book importantly too the device allows me to read outdoors thanks to its glarefree screen overall it is easy to use there is no learning curve required to become comfortable with the device even my 90 year old mother found it easy to use bundling all these benefits together with the rather modest price i paid 69 and i think it is an excellent bargain i strongly recommend it to anybody facing the same issues that i was,adjustable print light weight glare free and easy to use it meets all my needs
1.0,sorry i found the kindle very different from the nook and i really didnt like it, very different from the nook and i really didnt like it
5.0,day one postwill update later if neededso far i like my kindle a lot it is very simple and isnt overly complicated like some other tablets out there and instantly downloads books without any problems i dont know why people dont like it it is very simple and quite elegant and extremely light its actually lighter than my samsung s5 i can see myself reading hundreds of books on this thing and when im flying around the country which i do once in awhile it would be nice to have something that wont eat through a battery in 5 seconds i highly recommend this ereader definitely get the 10month kindle unlimited and maybe a led headlamp for hassle free nighttime reading,awesome kindle
2.0,i thought it had a lighted screen it didnt so i returned it go for the paperwhite this is hard to read in most light,mistake
5.0,i am so glad i got it i am still trying to learn how to use it i think i clicked on the wrong thing and i lost one of the books i was reading i just wasnt looking where i was going or i pushed the wrong button i love it but i had to get something to hold the book for me i am 78 years old and cant hold anything too long i love to read and i wanted something that i could take with me when i go to doctor or to take my husband to the va and i can read while i wait for himi dont like someone to read to me i like to read the kindle i dont like to read books anymore they are so big and heavy now the kindle is very light i knitted a little bag with a handle so i dont have any trouble fumbling in my pocket book i can just hang it on my arm and i am ready to go i hope i have helped you in deciding if you would love to have onelike i said i love this new inventioncheers ,i am so glad i got it
2.0,wanted a light and it didnt have one i should have read the description closer,two stars
4.0,i liked this device but discovered i had ordered one without a back light i dont see as well in low light as i used to one of the irritating things about getting older so i sent it back and got the one with the back light it is very light fits in my purse with no problem and the battery lasts for a long time it is just a reader so if you are looking for a tablet to do other things this wont work for you but it is an awesome ereader,light long battery and holds a ton of books
1.0,very disappointed half of the reason i bought it was to listen to audible books but it doesnt play audible books,very disappointed
1.0,sucks,one star
3.0,i am still learning my way around with it have ordered 2 books but have not been able to find them on my kindle hummmmso i have some learning to do yet,i am still learning my way around with it 
3.0,i bought my kindle expecting a full color display and got black and white expecting a useable instruction pamphlet i bought a leather cover and got cheap plastic 4th world junk i took this survey hoping to vent a little steam cant even do that screw you amozon,cheap junk
5.0,its a great upgrade from my kindle keyboard pages load faster and it is much lighter i think the feature i enjoy the most is the vocabulary builder as it is helpful in learning new words i believe its worth mentioning that this version does not have the text to speech feature nor a headphone input one thing i find questionable is the lack of a power charger but the kindle charges on my cell phone charger so its not a problem for me overall i am very happy with my purchase,great upgrade from my kindle keyboard
5.0,i am not pleased with the kindle and i want my money put back into my bank account please thank you,i am not pleased with the kindle and i want my money put 
2.0,not being a native english speaker i appreciated a lot the dictionary functionality in my older nontouchscreen kindle in the touchscreen version however the redesigned dictionary functionality is much less useful for a number of reasonssome dictionary articles for derived words are just referring to the main word for example the article for beheld has only this text beheld bi held past and past participle of behold now good luck navigating from here to the behold article in the old kindle the dictionary was displayed the same way the book is displayed with full support for looking up the words in the dictionary and additionally the reference to the main dictionary article was actually a hyperlink and you could just move cursor there and navigate to the behold article in the new dictionary design it is impossible none of the words in the dictionary popup window is clickable some articles are quite strange for example the article for mine has 5 meanings among which in addition to belonging to me and mine as in mining there is a list of things like 9th letter of the alphabet so it seems that the dictionary mixes together related words homonyms mine is form of i lets show the other meanings of the word i which does not make much sense if not confusing,the redesigned dictionary functionality is much less useful for a number of reasons
1.0,disappointed i was expecting better reading light additional lighting is required for me to read,disappointed
4.0,although i had the first kindle for at least 5 years i am trying to give this one a fair trial one way that i cant become accustomed to is the way of changing pages this kindle requires the little pentype thing and even then it is sometimes stubborn another way i find to take some changing is the way the books are displayed with the book covers since my eyesight is not strong i liked the titles to be displayed in print as it is i may be required to get a page enlargermicroscope did the developers think of visually impaired people who are trying to read the titles in the contents otherwise this kindle is acceptable,change for the visually impaired could be really good
5.0,this is amazing visit  you receive free psn card codes instantly everybody uses this now,five stars
3.0,full disclosure i previously owned a kindle fire hd that died very suddenly and inexplicably after 2 years of gentle use so my opinions on the kindle touch is after having owned a fancier model of kindleover all this is a good little ereader it does the job its small enough for me to hold operate one handed and i have smallmedium sized lady hands the font adjustment options make it easy to find something readable for your own eyes and the paperwhite screen is wonderful its so nice to be able to read outside on a sunny day without glare making it impossible to see the words i love how light this little thing is how portable and how easy straight forward to usemy biggest complaint is with the lag in doing well anything pages do not seamlessly turn it takes a second or two to utilize the xray or dictionary features etc its not a deal breaker but having come from the kindle fire hd its definitely something that i notice and am mildly irritated by also i sort of hate that its only black white buying books and seeing the fullcolour covers in my library is something that i missin general this is just a much more basic reading experience than what i experienced with the fire hd however that is to be expected as the price is essentially 13 of what the fire hd cost some trade off is to be expected i suppose i will say that having a more inexpensive ereader though lacking in some bells whistles that i had grown accustomed to is nice because i feel less worried about being careful with it and babying it there is a bit more freedom to be found with a device that doesnt cost hundreds of dollarsover all i would recommend this ereader to someone who really just needs a basic ereader that they can take on the bus traveling etc its portable its readable and it very much does the job however if having something fancy shiny is important to you you may want to consider one of the fire series readers,good but basic
2.0,i didnt check the details closely and didnt realize there was no audio support i wanted to use it to listen to audio books very disappointed,very disappointed
5.0,we got a kindle fire hd a while back but ive always hesitated pulling the trigger on the normal kindle readers for some reasonuntil now bought this during amazons ridiculous black friday in july thing a few weeks ago and then picked up the complete works of hp lovecraft to read while flyingwaiting at the airport absolutely no regrets easy to setup easy to customize on the fly easy to useplace bookmarks and the battery lasts forever compared to tabletsphones i charged it to 100 2 weeks ago and its still 50 and thats with me reading from it probably 12 hoursday i wish it was a bit easier to turn off the screen completely its easy to go to screensaver but holding the power button down for 7ish seconds isnt that hard once i figured thats how you power down the deviceplenty of storage space and amazons cloud makes it fairly easy to move books from cloud to device a to device b etc,small light easy to hold easy to read and very long battery life
2.0,it is very small and there is no backlight there is no comparison after using my ipad to read,waste of money
5.0,as always an invaluable toy i love that it has no backlight and doesnt hurt my eyes i love that i can tap any word and get the definition straight away i love that i can tap the screen and get additional information i love the free lenders library i love that i can convert from text to talk on any book i read so much more with this than an actual book and find reading so much more rewarding with the additional features over a book love it love it love it,love it love it love it
1.0,terrible i am a big kindle fan but this one has no built in light or ability to adjust brightness useless in a dark setting will return asap,no better than a paper book
4.0,great product cant give it five stars though battery definitely does not last weeks and just a couple of glitches in the software like page turns sometimes turn back more than one page its easy to rub the screen and the font size will change unexpectedly also i wish you could filter your library by samples also i wish the store had more of a curated storefront and when you browse bookswhat i do like about itgreat product for reading you get lost in the readingpretty darn good interfaceeasy to uselove the dictionarytouchscreen works greatgreat pricei definitely like the product and the price,great product cant give it five stars though
1.0,this was supposed to be a current refurbished kindle it was notyou know kindles color screen volume control speakers earphone jack mini usb port and this one was supposed to fit in a shirt pocketthis thing was a piece o crap paperwhite and the damn thing wouldnt even turn on and it was 34 inch too wide,paperwhite amazon for crap
4.0,it came as expected i was a bit disappointed in the asthetics of the device the back of the device is just plastic the back of my original one with buttons but not the one with the keyboard has a back that is different its lovely to hold versus this one this one feels cheaperthis device is also heavier than my previous model all in all i have no real complaints other than asthetics it will be going in a case so all will be well functionally the device works as expected i just have to get used to not pushing forward or back buttons on the sides,overall good asthetics are eh
1.0,why are these even being sold anymore outdated technology id rather read on my iphone,one star
5.0,love my new kindle i had a first generation 6 kindle since they came out and finally had to replace it i choose the newer one for the same reasons i got the first one size ease of use the touchscreen takes some getting used to as it has such a quick response you can move to far to quickly if you are not very careful i am sure with use i can master that as i have my other touchscreen devicesthe keyboard is much improved and so much better than the pop up keyboard on my old kindleif you are looking for a device that is easy to toss in any of your bagsbriefcases this is the one,love my new kindle
2.0,my original 79 kindle died last month and this is the new model that replaces it my old kindle not sure the generation was about 5 years old and it did not have a touch screen this is a very poor substitute it is lighter which is good but it is made with lightweight plastic not the metallike material of my old kindle i suspect this will crack easily the only accessories that fit this kindle are covers my old kindle had a rubber case like a skin that protected it while also making it easy to read with one hand if i want to hold a thing with a cover i can read a book but the worst part is the touch screen it seems like it turns the page if you breathe on it if you brush it with your sleeve you can wind up in the next chapter be careful when you pick it up or it will change the font ridiculous i am now sorry i didnt consider the voyage model which does not have a touch screen more seriously even though it has an outrageous price,this is progress
1.0,have had a hard time in getting to where we could read the story too many people trying to sell us more books,have had a hard time 1gettingnto where we could read 
1.0,i have a kindle fire and love it but can not use it outside i use it in the middle of the night without turning the lights on when i wake up and cant go back to sleep i bought the paper white to replace the kindle fire but i find that the model that i bought on amazon day for 69 is the cheap model that does not adjust the brightness very disappointed seems like a bait n switch to me,i have a kindle fire and love it but can not use it outside
3.0,im replacing a white kindle keyboard this is ok and does the job but im very disappointed that it doesnt have a headset jack i like to switch between reading and listening i want the glare free but i also want the audio also the older model had small holes in the side that allowed me to attach a slim cover with a led light the new model doesnt allow for that option,not as good as the old kindle keyboard
3.0,i like the touchscreen i was very disappointed it did not fit the case i already had from my previous kindle,i like the touchscreen
4.0,i finally broke down and purchased a kindle on sale at xmas since i wasnt sure i would like it i purchased the least expensive one available let me start off by saying that i read books from the library and generally i read hardcovers because the fonts are larger and there is ample vertical spacing paperbacks often have tiny fonts and the lines of text have no vertical spacing and i find it difficult to read i read freelibrary books on the kindle as i do not purchase booksthe internet speed on this device is horribly slow wait wait wait it loses a star for thati like that i can select text font and size the screen is not white bright so reading at night does not blast my eyes with blue light i can read for many hours before the device needs charging which for me is every couple of weeks i can read at least 30 hours with a single charge i have no real data just guesses the ui is easy to use and its mostly very goodwhat i dont like about it the screen flashes when you change pages and with reasonable sized fonts one changes pages more frequently than with a book i wish i could select the screen area for forwardbackward page movement if i accidentally touch the screen the page changesi cant comment on the features related to using the store to purchase booksim a luddite and still like paper books but the kindle is okits really not a bad little device for the price i,nice little device
4.0,dont like that you cant change the backlight on the page need a book light to read in the low lightdark,dont like that you cant change the backlight on the page
5.0,i replaced my 2nd generation kindle with this i have always loved using a kindle it is so easy to carry with me almost everywhere i go this version is even more compact its a great size which will fit in most purses it is still fantastic for reading inside or outside in the sunlight i really like the touch screen but i wish it didnt require wifi for downloading books i just need to make sure i have enough reading material before leaving the house,i have always loved using a kindle
1.0,its called a kindle but it doesnt even lite on fire good at all i expected a much better fire for the price,bad at fires
4.0,this is the 2nd reader ive had the first one was a kindle keyboard all of my experiences written in this review reflect that these are the only 2 readers ive usedi really like the new os and i think the features of the 7th generation are far better than the old kindle keyboard here are a few things i like as with previous versions you can add several dictionaries but with this one you can change dictionaries on the fly you touch and hold a word to pop up the dictionary then in the same view you can change dictionaries this is very helpful when you have a standard dictionary or two or three a bible dictionary and something like a tech or medical dictionary you can easily see what each dictionary says about that word on the same pop up as the dictionary is a wikipedia tab that allows you to see a brief description of what wikipedia says about that word thats very helpful especially if none of your dictionaries has a definition for the word you can quickly and easily see what books or documents you have on the device vs in the amazon cloud and you can easily move items back and forth tapping the go to tab while in a book allows you to see the various chapters and other divisions that may be built into the book and as before you can go to a particular page location etc you can thumb thru the pages of the book without leaving the page youre on this is useful if you want to reference something on another page while readingone thing i dont like is that active content cannot be installed on the kindle 7th gen i was very disappointed when i found that out on my kindle keyboard you can add active content like games address books notepads etc i had a notepad app on the kindle keyboard that i used every day it contained lists of books that i wanted to read and other things of that sort it was very useful to me to have that on the same device that i mainly use to readoverall i would recommend this reader unless active content is a must for you,lots i like one thing i dont like
1.0,i found it difficult to read unless i was sitting right beside a lamp it will be returned and exchanged for a paper white kindle which has a background light source,i found it difficult to read unless i was sitting 
1.0,im unable to do anything with it just read im unable to use dictionary for my own purpose when i go to dictionary im unable to bring up keyboard i would like to transfer everything i had in my old kindle i have been unsuccessful there also completely frustrated i have read your kindle manual but im not able to go back to the problems i want to address at that one particular time i think im going back to my old k however its screen has faded this is the reason why i went for k 6 on another subject can the screen on my old k be repaired i miss my dictionaries bibleetc,i would like to transfer everything i had in my old kindle
3.0,as a reader its great but i thought it had a backlight and it didnt mainly good for reading nothing else,as a reader its great but i thought it had a backlight and 
2.0,i have owned a kindle touch approx 2012 and also a kindle paperwhite 2014 but this device took away the home button which is so helpful then they took the screen and shoved it up an inch so the screen is no longer centered on the device i hate both these things about this and none of my other covers will fit it anymore because of that stupid wasted space at the bottom the guts of the device are still good its just i keep pressing dead space where there should be a home button which is now only touch available the whole thing is a bad design i actually prefer my older model kindle touch which also has the capacity to convert your books to audio a very robotic voice but its still helpful if you need to be hands free,i hate both these things about this and none of my 
1.0,it doesnt have light for reading at night i was sure this generación had built in light im not happy,its not what i needed
5.0,bought this as a gift for my nephew as a part of the kids bundle which is great as it also comes with a 2 year square trade warrantee i have a few kindles and have gotten one for my daughter sister and my mom in the past we are a kindle family this one with its protective case is a great value for the teen who isnt always as careful with his electronics as the warrantee covers breakage i look forward to him using it for years to come and being a reader,love it
1.0,returned ordered one with a light cannot read this one in bed with light offthe screen goes black,returned ordered one with a light cannot read 
5.0,bought this as a gift fro two people a dear friend and my younger brother my friend loves it so much that every time i see him he goes on about how amazing the kindle is and how much he has been able to get more reading done by having this great device i love seeing my brother use it because he has gotten more into reading and you can never go wrong with thatas for the device itself it is pretty nice and simple its small and lightweight so its easy to carry around reading feels almost like a real book and the only thing i miss when using it is that smell of paper you get when reading a real book but its nice to save the trees a little looking up the definition of words in the book couldnt be easier and having amazon prime it definitely makes the kindle a must have device only thing is that i wish it had some kind of light because reading at night now requires a book light or external light source i guess you could always get the newer version if that is a problem but for the price difference i am definitely happy with this one,great device to encourage reading small light and convenient to carry around great as a gift or for yourself or friends
2.0,dark screen would be wonderful for outside reading but to curl up with a book at night not so much,would be wonderful for outside reading
5.0,i am addicted to my kindle i love having a home library filled with physical books at my fingertips whenever im researching however having a kindle is wonderful for reading novels i never got to read many novels because much of my life has been spent in the textbooks with the kindle i am able to pick a textbook or novel out and read it without having to hold up a book and manage the pages and keep it from being at a bad angle i still prefer physical books for researching but maybe there is an adjustment period for me the kindle is always at a good angle is light weight and the screen is great on my eyes i have had an astigmatism for most of my life and reading has always caused headaches so enjoying reading is something i never experienced until having the kindle i got this kindle as a test to see if it would be a good gift for my daughter for christmas and we also purchased the paperwhite to see the difference i myself like the basic kindle better than the paperwhite because of the balance to its weight overall and the screen however i decided that i would give my daughter the paperwhite for christmas this year since she can read things with the light whereas i have a difficulty with lights my daughter likes to read in bed at night with just a night light and the paperwhite will be perfect for that she was upset when i told her we could only keep one and the paperwhite had to go back i really just wrapped it to give it to her after we decided she would enjoy itafter purchasing two kindles we ended up getting a third one for my mother who loves it as well,our family loves having kindles
3.0,im still getting used to it biggest problem i have is something popping up unexpectedly while im reading apparently i am unknowingly tapping something hopefully that wont happen as often as time goes on touchscreen may not be best for everyone meanwhile i still love the convenience of reading via a kindle,touchscreen may not be for everyone
5.0,received on time and was as advertised i am pleased with my purchase after finally using this kindle i feel it deserves more than my original 2 sentence review i do not like to write reviews but i am so happy with this purchase i wanted to encourage people to consider this item i owned the 69 kindle it was my first kindle and i loved it i hesitated buying this one because i felt how different could it be from what i already had well i was wrong this was a definite upgrade for me i love the touch screen i only use my kindle for reading books and this one makes me feel like i am reading a book it is fast and easy to handle the price is very reasonable you are definitely getting your moneys worth i spent weeks deliberating should i or shouldnt i and im glad i finally said i should,i am pleased with my purchase
5.0,i love it ive been a kindle convert for years and when my last one finally gave out on me i switched over to using my ipad and iphone in its stay after a few months i noticed my eyes straining to read at times and dryness in them id never experienced before turns out i was spending too much time staring at a computer at work only to go home and stare a bright screen all night the price as always is perfect and ive had zero eye issues sincei love the smaller design and the lightweight feel so easy to throw into even the smallest bag for a day so i always have my library at my fingertips,happy as always
4.0,all three of us enjoy our three kindles as we all read a great deal my first kindle is 6 years old and is starting to lose some battery life i bought this one to replace the old one in retrospect i think i probably should have upgraded to the paperwhite my wife and daughter have,like alot but paperwhite next time
1.0,did not like this returning for the one of the fires did not like the simple fact you could not control the brightness as i read at nighta simple option like that would of made me keep this,did not like this returning for the one of the fires
5.0,i really like this kindle it is light weight and easy to read i have a tablet which is very nice but i find myself using the kindle because it is so comfortable to use if you are looking for something fancy then this is not for you it is a great basic reader i also like the touchscreen,i really like this kindle
1.0,service ducks when you call in dont ever have a problem you will be in a 30 min discussion happened to me multiple times,service ducks when you call in dont ever have 
4.0,i like this kindle obviously this is not the backlit version so dont expect to read it in the dark connected to wifi on first try and loaded my ebooks onto it with no issues touch screen is fine for me not too sensitive i bought the adversion since it was cheaper no issues for me when ads are on the screen im not using the kindle so it doesnt affect me i got this on sale for 49 so it was a steal minus 1 star for the plastic backing which makes it very slippery to hold i dont plan to buy a case so this was a negative for me perhaps if they used a different material on the back so gripping it wouldnt be so difficult no i do not want to buy a case just for this,overall nice 
1.0,i took it back because the screen didnt light up and i couldnt see the screeni have the kindle fire 7 and 6 so im cool,i took it back because the screen didnt light up 
2.0,part of my disappointment is just my inability to figure out how to use this device does not come with a users guide because the guide is on the devicenot very useful if you cant read the reader us older folks at least this one need more direction than just where the on button is i will figure it out but feel it should have been much easier and better explained in a get started booklet at the very least very frustrating i would and probably will have to call customer support and add the frustration of trying to understand some wellmeaning person who cannot speak english your customer support is not as good as you think it is,part of my disappointment is just my inability to figure out how to 
1.0,cant see to read it i must be a dummy because i cant figure out how to change the brightness wished i didnt buy it,cant see to read it i must be a 
5.0,love love love our kindlethis is our 3rd purchase for another family member i have personally owned a kindle since the day they launched them many years ago not only do i love that it is like reading off regular paper and print but i can also read it directly in the sunlight just like a real paper book choose a great leather cover and it is even better than a paper book as well amazoncom has fabulous customer serviceany time that i have had an issue with a kindle which is rare they immediately solve or replace the device best purchase ever,love love love our kindle
1.0,in attempting to encourage prereaders i mistakenly bought this product be advised that it is in black and white only,in attempting to encourage prereaders i mistakenly bought this product 
4.0,this is my 4th kindle ive only had the keyboard version until now but i took the chance and ordered one during prime day its smaller than the keyboard version and im just getting used to the new device layout but so far its working great my current kindle keyboard was purchased used and with special offers i decided to pay to have the offers taken off so whemn the time came to choose this model i paid a little more to get a device without the special offers the so arent intrusive at all it was just my preference to get a device without them so fae im pleased the touch interface does take some getting used to as i am used to physical keys to turn pages but so far thats my only complaint,but so far its working great my current kindle keyboard was purchased used and 
1.0,we are not happy with this kindle we need to return it please send me info on how to return this itemthank you,we are not happy with this kindle
5.0,i have a kindle fire hd and have had a lot of problems reading it in or near direct sunlight i bought this and the case and it has worked great i can even wear polarized sunglasses and read the kindle in direct sunlight there really doesnt seem to be much difference between looking at a paper book page and the kindle so this was a great purchase for me of course not having the integrated light means that i cant read in low light situations but thats what i have my kindle fire hd for,great for reading in direct sunlight no glare
2.0,it doesnt light up to read at night and it isnt in color and you cant play games on it i wasnt very impressed,it doesnt light up to read at night and it 
5.0,love it very glad i got this version without the screen light and without the ads i deliberated long and hard comparing this model with the paperwhite the kindle fire nexus kobo nook samsung etc i previously had a 2010 nook and then later a 2012 nexus 7 comparing the two dedicated ereaders i like this way better than the nook battery is far superior pageturning is better and its considerably lighter i chose to go with this as opposed to a nexus or kindle fire because i didnt really need it for web surfing or email i have my smart phone and my 12 computer to perform those functions i wanted the very best ereader with the longestlasting battery and i feel that is what i got kindle 6 glarefree touchscreen display wifilove love love the fact that i can read it outside in full sun and can easily see the screen no matter how much glare there is ive only had it just over a week so cant comment yet on its durability but it sure is lightweight very easy on the eyes the pageturning function is easy and reliable and the battery is superb im retired with plenty of time to devote to reading now that its winter and this first week i read an average of 8 10 hours a day and the battery still lasted me over a week really looking forward to taking this on our upcoming cruise where cell phones dont work and internet time on the ship costs 42hour so this handy device is bound to save me from boredom because i dont plan to be online much at those prices if you just want something for reading books dont want to spend a fortune and dont want to have to even think about your battery this is the one to get by the way i signed up for kindle unlimited at 999month and im absolutely loving it its totally worth it and its such a pleasure to buy with one click and have it magically appear on my kindle within less than 30 seconds no more downloading saving finding copying and all that just click the book you want on amazon and presto it appears on your kindle and you can start reading it really couldnt be easier,battery lasts an unbelievably long time and its super thin and light
1.0,this tablet sucks it will not connect to my wifi i have tried everything will not reccomend this to anyone,dont buy
1.0,the kindle was very cheap not in color couldnt see very well as was so dark not what i was expecting at all,the kindle was very cheap not in color 
2.0,extremely had to operate problem here problem there would not have purchased if i had know how it operated,two stars
5.0,i love this i have always prefered the plain kindle over the color ones but after reading kindle books on my touchscreen smart phone i missed the ability to touch a word to find its definition this kindle exactly meets my needs i can use touchscreen for those features but it still is small portable and one charge lasts several weeks all the benefits of the original with a touchscreen and the right price i highly recommend it,i was hoping for this
4.0,i liked my old kindle for reading periodicals and books it was not a touch screen and was much easier to navigate than this newer version with the touch screen the screen is as easy to read outdoors and its compact size makes it easy to pack and travel my major complaint is that the touch screen is very sensitive causing it to double skip pages and doesnt respond to reversing the error i also have a kindle fire and only use this new kindle for reading as the display performs better in the light of outdoors,new reader not as good as the older model
1.0,i was very disappointed that this kindle didnt backlight for night reading i should have read more of the description before ordering this kindle,i was very disappointed that this kindle didnt backlight for night reading
5.0,ive had my new kindle for a few weeks now and i love iti had the 5th generation before with the side buttons and the ones on the front it wasnt dying but i wanted an upgrade and i was able to give my old one to my kid sister so that she could travel with a library in her bagthe only issue i have with the touchscreen kindle is that it seems to be almost too sensitive i vape and anytime my smoke hits the screen the font size changes i have no idea why this is but it happens the other thing is that anytime i set the kindle down on a metal surfacelike the side of my stove or the metal wastebasket in my bathroomit goes into standby modehonestly i find these issues more amusing than anything so im not too bothered by it overalli am really really happy with the goodreads link system and the timer that lets you know how much longer you should expect to be on a chapter or the book entirely now when im reading a really good book and glance at the clock to calculate how much sleep ill have before work i can do it within a smaller margin of error it helps with my neurosisoveral im loving this i would recommend it to everyone the glarefree screen is perfect i couldnt do any of the backlit screens because of my sensitive eyes and this is a great way to keep my headaches in check and enjoy my favorite books in a light userfriendly device,i have an overly sensitive kindle
1.0,to sell an ereader without a backlight for night time reading is just silly i returned it better options from other manufacturers at this price,no backlight cant read at night
5.0,as a big reader i have owned many kindle this kindle is my favorite in size and ease i love reading outside and with this screen i can see on the brightest day as well as on an overcast day i have nothing bad to say not one to nitpick things i can honestly say theres nothing to nitpick here im sure there are those people that can but why this kindle does exactly what i bought it for to be able to relax and read with enjoyment i would recommend this to all that love the joy of reading,the right one for me
2.0,these were purchased and donated to a school not sure they how they will work for our students to read from but that is what we will use them for,these were purchased and donated to a school not 
4.0,i have a kindle which i have been using for several years i use it almost daily and i have more books in it than i ever could fit into my limited bookcasepros long battery life ease of reading large number of books available many are either free or less than 5cons many places i go to still have the old peertopeer wifi which is completely incompatible with any kindle if kindle doesnt start allowing users to register and manage the installed software through the plugin to the internet connection this will be unusablei want to get a new one like this to carry with me in lieu of a book my kindle got dropped and the case is cracked but until this negative is fixed anyone in my situation will have to either get a 3g kindle or go with a different reader,best ebook reader on the market
1.0,hate it cheaply made cannot find any way to light it up so impossible to use want to return it but have not had the time feels like a cheap toy,cheaply made
5.0,bought this item as a gift my friend loves to read and takes this on the train with her all the time if youre thinking about getting one i suggest purchasing an amazon prime membership as well because it gives you access to over 500000 books which is a great compliment to this product,get amazon prine with this
1.0,so far it is ok not used to touch page and having a little trouble remembering the symbols but u didnt show one like i had that quit working,new kindle
5.0,this entry level ereader has a lot offer for its low price it has great response time when flipping pages and displays text in high resolution due to its use of eink it acts and looks just like a paper book and does not bother ones eyes like traditional lcd displays would i would recomend this ereader to anyone who is an avid reader that is looking to transition to ebookson a semiunrelated note i had noticed that there were some reviews on this item that gave it only 1 star 1 star not because the device was doa not charging not loading books or freezing no they gave it 1 star because a it wasnt backlit b it didnt have page buttons on the side like previous models or c didnt come with directionswifisince some people on here are too incompetent to read a device description about an ereader i will list some points to save you money and future regret1 its not backlit no where in the description does it say that its backlit if you want a backlit kindle you should have purchased the paperwhite or voyager2 its a touch screen you dont even have to read the description to understand that the preety product pictures clearly show no page buttons the only button on the device is the power button3 the directions are in the kindle there are two manuels books preinstalled for you that tell you everthing that you would want to know about your kindle the one labeled setup will guid you through the process of setting up your kindle4 if you dont understand how to setup your kindle have someone who is techsavvy do it for you5 leaving a 1 star review on a product that is specialy designed for reading because you are too incompetent to read the discription of the device makes me lose faith in humanity,awesome entry level ereader
1.0,kindle products are of poor quality dont last and use antiquated technology amazon doesnt stand behind them when they breakand they will,kindle bad product
5.0,love the kindle but amazon should stop using lasership they play your game using prime saying the package was delivered on time when its not i see hundreds of people have been complaining about lasership since 2010 i had 2 packages in one week that tracked as delivered when they werent the kindle is great the shipping needs repair,great kindle lasership

1.0,why is it that every time you buy so much as a stick of gum now days some corporate shmuck wants you to write a review or complete a survey ,review this
5.0,by far one of my best purchases each of my sons ages 9 and 11 had the kindle fire and they read on it at home but they also were tempted to play their games on the fire too this they now can take to school they have used this so much and they are reading a lot more i have recommended this to all parents i know,by far one of my best purchases each of my sons ages 9 and 
2.0,there is no light in this kindle and i cannot use it at night thats a waste and it should be made blatant that there are no light controls,waste of a kindle no night reading
2.0,im disappointed because my kindle arrived without the ability to make the back screen lighter or darker otherwise it works fine,im disappointed because my kindle arrived without the ability to make 
2.0,dislike,i made a mistake i meant to order kindle light
1.0,boos,one star

5.0,love it,five stars
5.0,had issues with the original one i got the battery was going down super quickly and the screen was unbelievably touchy it was easy to work with amazon and get a replacement though happy to say the old one must have been a dud because the new one isnt nearly as bad on the battery,love it
3.0,i liked my first one i ordered too bad it was stolen now finally that i got all my books downloaded on the second kindle its ok what were the special offers,i liked my first one i ordered
5.0,i love it i previously had the kindle keyboard and it finally went kaput on me i love the eink so i went with this one i was leary of the paper white because of the backlight i stare at a computer screen all day at work and i didnt want to feel like that was what i was doing at home toothis little gadget is a perfectly portable size albeit a little thicker than the keyboard version but nothing you cant get used to in a couple uses the touch screen is responsive with no over sensitivity uses im really enjoying it so far and the battery is holding up really well still on the first charge after a week of daily use i would definitely recommend happy reading,perfectly portable
2.0,it hate it the touch screen is so annoying the font and font size change for no apparent reason i am giving mine away and have found a nontouch screen used,it hate it the touch screen is so annoying
4.0,i really like the kindle ive never had an ereader before and frankly didnt see the point of them the kindle was only 60 when i got it though so i figured i would give it a try after using it for a few weeks i definitely see the appeal its extremely light even lighter than my phone the screen is great it really does feel like reading a paper book and the battery has grew endurance about 2 weeks on a half charge out of the box i think i bought this at a perfect time i get a device with a touch screen and decent resolution for a great price while the old kindle only had physical buttons or you had to get the more expensive model with a touch screen the only downsides to the device are the lack of a backlight and the recessed screen tends to gather dust in the seams between the screen and the casing i really like the kindle but i think im going to exchange it for the paperwhite since i would like to do more reading at night when i get him from work without having the lights on,i really like the kindle
2.0,i was going to return kindle e reader but bill can next day after its arrival so had no time to do so it sits in box delivered in and probably will remain so,i was going to return kindle e reader but bill 
5.0,it was easy to set up it charges quickly and very easy to use it is lightweight and easy to hold it is glare free which makes it easy to read without straining my eyes it fits easily in my purse when i want to take it with me it comes with nice features i really like the dictionary very happy with my purchase,five stars
2.0,do not like this product at all cannot download books from my computer onto kindlelight is very poor and cannot increase the brightness very disappointed,do not like this product at all
4.0,this is my first kindle i am not sure what i was expecting it looks like a toy it is so light and the screen looks like a sticker lol it is much smaller than i thought it would be that is not a complaint its about the size of the average paperback without the bulk i love the convenience of book shopping on it it is a little annoying that it takes up half the screen giving recommendations i wish it had a more bookshelf look to it battery life seems fantastic and it charges really quickly it isnt lighted which is something i didnt think i would mind at the moment but i might order a different one or a lighted case i have wanted one for a while and all and all i dont feel let down i dont love it and will probably give it to my 8 year old and get myself one with a lighted screen but i really like this kindle and i dont think i will buy another paperback,four stars
1.0,very basic machine for the money screen size is really smaill which i knew the size when ordered but reading on it something else very disappointed,very basic machine for the money screen size is 
2.0,yes i know it isnt backlit no i dont mind thumbing to flip pages no i dont like it because my old one one of the first kindles was much more user friendly i would love to have one like my old one that finally froze and couldnt come back to life i had 70 unread books stored on the old one i cannot determine which in my cloud ive read and which i need to deliver to the new kindle with few exceptions i could deliver the whole cloud content which would not be any better in trying to determine which i havent read this is a bummer all the way around,no i dont like it because my old one one of the first 
3.0,purchased it for my daughter but it doesnt have a back light for reading at night or in dark places so i returned it otherwise she was happy with it,otherwise she was happy with it
5.0,i love this device it has given me back the pleasure of reading i have a form of dyslexia that makes reading black words on stark white pages very difficult scotopic sensitivity syndrome or irlen syndrome this device makes it easy for me to read and comprehend what it is i am reading because it doesnt have that blinding contrast on the page and it is so convenient i have so many books on it to compliment my varied interests and i can carry them all around in my coat pocket and my bible is always at my fingertipsreading a good book is now the pleasure it was intended to be,reading is a convenience and a pleasure
5.0,this is my second kindle my first was the one with buttons 4th generation very easy to navigate has a new feature call good reads full of hardcore readers that they think they are expert in writing or something and some casual readers i didnt bother with it much my only problem is that if feels hollow like a big calculator and makes it feel kinda cheap which i understand was to make i light so you need to buy a cover for this to keep it looking good and feel good, first was the one with buttons 4th generation very easy to navigate has a new feature call good reads 
5.0,ive thoughoughly enjoyed two nook ereaders over the last few years however both have eventually broken where the charging cord attaches to the unit very frustrating when i have hundreds of books samples downloaded on each getting support for nook is frustrating very hard to communicate with overseas reps i was reluctant to change because of my extensive nook library but since i buy everything else on amazon this move made sense i love my new kindle it costs less than nooks is lighter holds a charge for over a week and has some cool features that i like most importantly you get more extensive definitions when looking up words and they are then added to your own list of vocabulary words dorky but fun to look back over and see if i remember what the words ive already looked up mean i also enjoy the xray feature ive compared a couple of ebook prices and they are cheaper through amazon than on barnes noble i was annoyed that amazon charges for an adfree version so i bought the one with ads i dont mind them at all in fact have even clicked on few my only complaint come on on amazon and just include a charger thats kind of ridiculous to charge extra for something that should be included,switched from nook to kindle
5.0,my first kindle died after i evidently rolled on it a bit too hard it was a kindle keyboard and i had done over 500 books when it croakedand now i have the new one and i love it back in the bookreading businessbtw i do like the interface more akin to the fire interface my wife has one less like the gopher interface of a long long time ago prewww,and i love it back in the bookreading business
5.0,returned,five stars
1.0,i wont buy it without texttospeech so i am disappointed i have a cochlear implant and texttospeech helps me to learn to listen why remove it on the new model put texttospeech back,must have texttospeech for cochlear implanted reader
3.0,the reaon i only gave it a 3 is because its a great e reader but there are no games that can be played on it if a person needs a break from a book but needs entertainment to kill time, only gave it a 3 is because its a great e reader but there are no games that can 
2.0,i ordered this kindle and sent it back i was very disappointed with the screen it is way to dark and it can not be brighten up so if your expecting to be able to read in the dark forget it a separate light has to be purchased also and it makes it more costly overall,dark screen
2.0,had to replace my old kindle touch which bit the dust after continual issues with the power button sticking and breaking great deal during black friday on the new kindle sadly the new kindle 7th gen does not have texttospeech and will not play the active content word games i enjoyed on the kindle touch i had expected to be able to transfer everything over from the old kindle but clearly was mistaken beware,not up to snuff less versatile than older models
3.0,i was assured that this model had back light i cannot locate how to turn it on im thinking it does not have that capability that was one of the main reasons i purchased it,i was assured that this model had back light 
5.0,even with the most basic model amazon still makes a worthwhile ereader granted i bought kindle fire hd 6 to be shared with the family its been passed around so much that by the time it get passed along to me i dont have much time to read i knew it was going to happen eventually so when it sooner than i expected i settled on a refurbished kindle touch in this case settling turnout to be one the best decisions i made in whilethe refurbished kindle touch is almost indistinguishable from its new predecessors except sometime during lifetime it was returned to amazon for some reason the device itself the most basic of ereader offered by amazon primarily to get you to buy ebooks from their online store but can also be used read ebooks borrowed from public libraries and carry around compatible personal documents pending you dont mind the monochrome presentation resembling a small tablet computer in alot of respects it is an ereader distinguishes itself from tablets with a monochrome electronic ink screen that does not refresh itself like other lcd screens and has a lower power consumption rate that can make the battery last for days weeks between recharges this is a dedicated ereader there are no apps that can be installed and no speaker or headphone jack to listen to mp3s or audiobooks perhaps more importantly this model is not a paperwhite and you must have your external light source to read in lowlight situationsas good as it is there is one major fault that i discovered the hard way while amazon elaborates in alot of official documentation about personal documents and cloud storage a rather perverse semantics come into play access to the cloud library is not the same as amazons cloud drive in other words if you have personal files stored on amazons cloud drive they will not be accessible from this version of the kindle in order to read your personal documents from the kindle you must either send them via email or copy them via usb as a corollary by plugging in this kindle to your computer its identified as mass storage device so managing it is not much different from a usb flash driveif you can keep the above in mind i think you can really make for you i bought the refurbished kindle primarily to save every cent i could and what i get out of it more than makes up for its limits you can buy inexpensive generic clipon spotlight for lowlight reading and if all you do to read the kindle is more than suited to the task with the durability and ease of use you can only get at these prices in addition to buying kindle i would recommend buying foliotype cover and screen protector to further increase the longevity of your kindle,a ereader with without the premium pricetag
2.0,no i made a mistake i wanted the kindle so i could read while the lights were off and this model doesnt have the built in light so im stuck with it is very uncomfertable,no i made a mistake i wanted the 
4.0,honestly i thought i was getting the newer daylight to dark version of a kindle this one is nice enough but the other would have been greater because i use public transit and standing in the dark with nothing to read is boring my old kindle had a light built into the case that i really really loved alas it the kindle died after four years and the case kept having issues with the little prong breaking offi love the size of this kindle it fits more easily into my bag the printing is really nice it is good i just wish id scrolled down on the page to find the one i really wanted,a good enough kindle
3.0,i received this for my birthday shortly after christmas i am quite disappointed that i cannot read it in the darkthat was the main reason on i wanted a kindle ,i am quite disappointed that i cannot read it in the dark
5.0,it doesnt have a light or the ability to turn pages with a squeeze but otherwise this kindle has all the very cool features of the more expensive kindles at a much lower price i especially like that rather than having to jump around in the book and potentially lose your place footnotes and end notes open in a window on top of the text you can also open a window to flip backward and forward through the books pages without moving off the page you are on for reading longer books or nonfiction with footnotes these two features alone make this kindle a treasure,all the features at a lower price including windows that open for footnotes and flipping through pages wo losing your place
3.0,while i like all the features i also like to play games the kindle is not compatible with one single game even with the most basic kindle you can get a couple of games,while i like all the features
5.0,i purchased this ereader on cyber monday and thus far i am very pleased with its performance if you desire an economical device that provides uninterrupted reading then this device is highly recommended i like the fact that i can obtain so many free books from amazon as wells as other sites while i have several devices i strictly use this one for the pure enjoyment of uninterrupted reading,great device
1.0,this is not the item i ordered this wasnt the same picture of the kindle fire i was very upset this item arrive so i m sending them back even the order number was change,disappointed customer
2.0,we received the unit on time which is great however one of the features that my wife loves wasnt available on this unit mainly audio that is text to speech feature as her vision isnt as good as it used to be reading is more difficult and the texttospeech feature was ideal will check to see if this feature is on other kindles,texttospeech absent
2.0,came to me on time but the language isin chinese and after youtubeing it it doesnt have a language setting and customer service was no help i am very dissatisfied,only buy if u know a 2nd language
1.0,i do not like this kindle where are the instructions for use i cannot find the archivessaw them once but they were not in list form and the cover picture form is unreadable i wish i had my old kindle back where is the back button when i am shopping in the kindle store and looking at the array of books i cannot page forwardwhatever i touch goes to that book not the next page bummer,wish i had my old kindle back
4.0,my old kindle 1st gen with keyboard stopped working when my daughter stepped on it this new one works well honestly i preferred the hardware buttons for page turning it was easier for onehanded reading but im getting used to the new one i know that touch screens are newerbetter but occasionally when i try to go to the next page it pulls up a word definition,pretty good but i miss the physical buttons
4.0,i bought my mother a kindle but i resisted buying one for myself for a long time because i like to read ebooks on my iphone or ipad however amazon offered a deal for prime members which made this kindle only 50 i thought it over and decided for that price it would be nice to be able to read in direct sunlight and not have to worry about running down my battery after a couple of hours of reading as it does on my iphone the kindle i had bought for my mom was one with a keyboard and side clickbuttons i wasnt that keen on having that type of awkward navigation but this particular model is a touch kindle when it arrived i was very pleasantly surprised that it wasnt too different from using my iphone for navigation in that you touch the screen to do this or that i did have to go look at some tutorials online to get the hang of it but it is fairly simple to use now that i know where to touch the screen for the home page or forward and back pages i like the size and weight it is about like reading a paperback book maybe even a little lighter i can almost hold it in one hand and use a finger to turn the pages on the same hand although it isnt as easy as with the iphone for thatthere are only a couple of things that i find annoying the onoff button is on the bottom edge of the frame i tend to hold a book or kindle on the sides or bottom and i have accidentally turned it off while reading because my finger touched the onoff button the onoff button would be better if it was at the top rather than the bottom the other thing is that i cant seem to bookmark more than one page at a time i am in the middle of a project of converting to ebooks more than 50 stories and novels from a series that is long out of print these stories have been scanned and turned into editable text and proofed mostly on my computer but i still find typos while reading on the kindle i want to be able to put a bookmark on each page that i find a typo on so i can go to my computer later and fix them all at one time i think i am supposed to be able to bookmark more than one page but these ebooks i have converted myself dont seem to let me do that if anyone knows what i am doing wrong there let me know,it is great for reading outside in the hammock
5.0,there is not really much i can add to the reviews here the kindle does exactly what i expected it is a simple ereader without bells and whistles which is just what i wanted setting it up was easy one feature i love is that if you are reading a series it recommends the next one in line even with my arthritis i find it easy to hold page turning is as simple as swiping the screen or giving it a light touch i would recommend it to anyone looking for a basic ereaderthis is my first kindle although ive been an ebook reader for years my other ereaders have all been from that huge brickandmortar us chain with the green logo i have no regrets about my investment in hardware or books from there but i do regret not getting a kindle sooneri got my kindle through a rewards program at work it came with special offers but it was worth it to me to pay the 20 to get rid of the ads they did not intrude on reading in the slightest i just didnt want to see them so if you do get the one with the ads you can always go back and pay the difference to get them removed,no bells and whistles just a good ereader
1.0,way to basic,one star
1.0,not my order,one star
1.0,bad product,not what i expected
3.0,its pretty much standard that any tablet display is illuminated so i was surprised that this one is not still might keep it for hubby to use on the commuter train but this is not what i wanted unfortunately,its pretty much standard that any tablet display is illuminated
1.0,the description of this product needs a prominent warning that can only be used in a well lighted area barely readable in normal room lighting much too small constantly flipping pages annoying i was hopeful that this would be a solution to reading books before going to sleep at night but it was not to be returning it wish they made a paperwhite with an 8 inch screen,no light seriously too small
1.0,no light,one star
5.0,thats ok,five stars
4.0,i actually like this kindle very much it is easy to read and the battery lasts forever before needing a chargemy problem is not with the kindle but with amazon book store it is far too easy to accidentally press a button and buy a book without it asking for confirmation etc i realize that amazon subsidizes the price of the kindle but there needs to be a way to require a confirmation to keep from buying a book by accident in the end i was able to get a credit but you need to be really careful flipping pages looking at available books,good product but be careful
4.0,itll do,four stars
4.0,i been reading a kindle from about second generation and i love these devices i stare at back lit devices all day at work so the last thing i want to is read off of one at night the screen is very easy on the eyes and i can read for hours no problem my only complaints is that some features are lost in the latest generation of my kindle old active content games mostly dont work i cant have blogs delivered and the texttospeech feature has been removed,lost a few features but otherwise a good device
1.0,this is my 6th kindle i had to replace two of them one 6 inch and one fire but i have enjoyed eas of reading for the last 5 years need two because the fire cant be read in sunlight at the beach,satisfaction
2.0,it was great for a year now it will not load new books it took 2 hours of online chat to get it to reload the books that i previously bought i am giving 2 stars because i loved it when it worked and after working with that amazing chat personnow i can read the prior purchases but whats the deal with being able to purchase but not download new books the kindle has not been dropped or in any way abused it wont hold internet connection flips back and forth between queued and loading maybe 2535 of a book at the same time the kindle app on iphone and ipad is totally brokenbooks were wiped off the devices and cannot be downloaded i have spent maybe only an hour on calls for this problem and have gotten nowhere the chat person said it was not something she could fix tech people have not called back as they promised perhaps because i live overseas i have done every possible reset so dont tell me to do that i have done so multiple timesfollow up months later after the recent hardware upgrade i had hopes a few books downloaded as they should now it is back to having to download to computer and then drag to the kindle even the download usually takes 23 tries before it is successful it used to be easy now it is not it is still handy once you get the books on it,beware only good for one year even the app doesnt work consistently anymore
1.0,i had a problem with my screen 15 months after my purchase impossible to switch it on again this is not a rare issue the only thing the customer service proposed me was to buy a new one with 10 offdisappointing,faulty product
5.0,i resisted ebook reading for years i didnt think i would like it and i was positive i would miss the tactile feeling of holding a book i am by nature a person who loves tradition and theres a big part of me that doesnt want to see the loss of physical media for our entertainment the look feel and even smell of those physical objects is part of the experience then i decided to try one my fingers were having a reaction to book paper and it was worth a shoti took my kindle on vacation and i love it put a covercase on it and it still feels nice the display is amazing and worked perfectly for comfortable reading under dim light bright sunlight and even a reading light at night i loved being able to zoom the text size in and out so that i could make it whatever was comfortable to read at the distance i wanted or needed to hold the kindle away from me i also liked the weight it light but its substantial enough that i didnt feel as if i were carrying a toy all that plus i got to carry a whole lot of books with me for a tiny bit of weight tucked in my carryon laptop caseim hooked,i didnt think i would like it and i was positive i would miss the 
3.0,a decent product and works well however file organization is difficult1 all filesdocuments have to be placed under the folder document2 if i create sub folder under documents to organize filesdocuments it does not workthey all show up at the document folder level3 the only way to group filesdocuments is to use collection for tag filesdocuments but tagging is not a intuitive way of file organizationbecause the limitation of filedocuments management i become overwhelmed when i loaded 30 filesdocuments it became very difficult to find filessomethings for next firmware release to enhance,a decent product and works well however file 
5.0,i loved my original kindle with the keyboard and e ink more than anything after i broke mine i got this one which is nice too i like being able to use it as a book and when your outside in the sunlight you can still read it unlike the shiney more reflective screens when it is dark you would normally turn on a light to read and you will with this too i like that i am old school so the touch screen i am not as thrilled with as i was the key pad and button to push when changing the page but i think i like it and do use it,i loved my original kindle with the keyboard and e ink 
5.0,my 16 yr old loves it it is easy on the eyes as expected with the natural color good quality much better than storing a ton of books and easy to take with you slim case easy to use love the fact that digital books are cheaper as well thank you,great kindle
5.0,it is perfect for what it isan e reader sharp clear adjustable fonts easy to use and featherweight light with this device you can have a large number of books at your fingertips what every purchaser should know is that this is not a tablet and amazon has never marketed or promoted it as one this is a generation 7 kindle it is not a backlit display so you will have to read it in a place with adequate ambient light just like reading a book or buy a little clip on reading lamp if you are looking for the backlit version you need to buy the kindle paperwhite buying new books from the amazon store is a snap once you have your account set up i had an existing account so i simply had to log in it is also possible to download kindle format ebooks through your local library limit 5 at a time through overdrivecom but you must have a library card and set up a password of your choosing finding and downloading books from the kindle is not the way to go it is possible but the kindle browser is slow and difficult to read it is far easier to connect the kindle to your pc and download the kindle ebook through overdrive overdrive sends it to your amazon account online you just go to your amazon bookshelf online and download through your pc to the kindle i bought mine through amazon on sale for 4999 with my amazon credit visa accrued points i ended up coming out of pocket about 2000 i couldnt be happier so far i hope you will find this review helpful,perfect for what it is
1.0,i loved the original kindle this one i hate you barely touch screen and dictionary or other stuff pops up page doesnt always switch very picky wish i had my old one back you cant play games on it either missing my solitaire grrrr dont get this one,i loved the original kindle
5.0,i bought this kindle for 2 reasons 1 it was on sale for 29 and 2 the size you can’t beat the price and it was a real steal for 29 i own the original kindle with the keyboard and a kindle fire and absolutely love this one as a backup for days when i want something portable and lightweight for reading onlyi agree with other posters that this kindle is not for you if you want the following a light external buttons or anything other than a reading device this device does not have a light i bought mine with the clear understanding that if i wanted a light i would have to buy a kindle paperwhite so please don’t be confused personally it has a better display than my original kindle with the keyboard which looked almost gray and not as bright as this one it is pleasant to use this kindle in regular light and there is no glare the display is crisp and cleanthere are no external buttons except the power button and everything else is touch screen which is what i like my only comment is the fact that sometimes there is a tiny microsecond of lag when turning pages but nothing to get upset about for the price i paid i’m not complainingfinally the thing i like most about this handy little device is the size and portability i positioned it next to my iphone 6 and it is a few inches larger in both directions but not much the display is generous and it feels good in my hands while holding it i did purchase a case since i didn’t want it to get scratched up but overall well worth the money i find myself going for this one before the kindle fire when i don’t want to carry the extra weight in my pursealso and i think this goes back to comments from when the kindle was first released the device comes with a microusb charging cable but not a wall plug but if you’re like me you’ve got 2 or 3 wall plugs already from other devices so no worries there either,i love it
1.0,i want to return it,one star
1.0,i was so disappointed when my kindle arrived and no longer has audio capability it was definitely not obvious on the amazon website that the newer kindle doesnt have this function i knew that the paper white did away with it but i thought all of the kindle touchescreens maintained audio well turns out i was wrong and i am returning it,no audio capability returning
2.0,not kid friendly,two stars
2.0,very disappointed in my new kindle i replaced my 2012 kindle as the touch screen stopped working and while i read the reviews etc i always assumed the built in light was a standard featiure of all kindles im so disappointed in this newer version which is clearly a downgrade,no built in light is a big problem
1.0,let me rephrase the 1 star rating so far the kindle its self is a nice fully operational unit with many feature i love that is not the complaint no cases are available with built in reading light for this unit we including the amazon helpdesk could not find anything other than an attachable clip on led light amazon was nice enough to apply a promotional credit so that i may purchase a clip on light one would think when creating a new generation kindle they would have thought ahead and had some sort of night time reading cases or such prepared very disappointing that i have to buy a case and a separate light,beware no cases available with built in light
2.0,cant read it in the dark,two stars
5.0,im in love ive figured out why they call it a kindle because it truly rekindled my love for reading its easy on my eyes unlike my ipad and simple to throw in my purse unlike a book i am also one of the add readers where i like to read a couple diff genres of book at once for example im reading you the owners manual lena dunhams book a scary thriller and some stupid little fiction i got for free from amazon i would look like a crazy person carrying 4 books around with me but with my kindle i can i really am in love its perfect,rekindled spirit
1.0,dont like it,one star
5.0,the text is really easy to read i went with this one as opposed to the other ones because of the antiglare it reads like paper and the battery life i didnt need all of the bells and whistles since i already have a 2in1 tablet it is very lightweight,nice screen
1.0,cant brighten screen,one star
3.0,it does what its supposed to so thats good but it feels kinda cheap next to my old kindle touch the touch had a nice smooth finish on the back and a more sophisticated look in general the touch also had little pickups in the back to power an led light built into the case this was a great feature for reading in bed wish they had carried it over to the new model,so thats good but it feels kinda cheap next to my 
3.0,no thank you,three stars
5.0,this little kindle is the best ereader i have seen so far its very much like you are holding a book the print is easy to seesharp and clear no glare or shadow i use mine everyday and find its in serious competition with regular paper editions of reading material downloads are instantaneous and i also like the fact that everything i download is saved to the cloud without separate steps involved happy i got a good deal and reading has replaced the tv as a relaxation tool very happy with my kindle,this little kindle is the best ereader i have seen so far
1.0,way to small,one star
5.0,i bought this kindle ereader as an upgrade to my older 3rd gen kindle ereader i do love this new 7th gen ereader and have only one complaint scrolling through all my ebooks on the cloud almost 5000 books is a long tedious process to get to the book i want the search feature doesnt always work well i think amazon could do alot better in that area but other than that i do like the 7th gen it has way more storage and you do have your cloud books available to download easily the battery charge lasts longer than the 3rd gen and the touch screen works well,new 7th generation kindle ereader
4.0,this is my second kindle yep loved my first one to death  this replaces my original model keyboard kindle i love how easy it is to use and hold in one hand lightweight but sturdy perfect for this avid reader i havent come close to filling it up with books and love all the different options for font size and sync abilities so i recommend this to everyone who wants a reader nothing heavy nothing oversized or so many complicated apps and options you want to scream simple but perfect,loved my first one to death
3.0,the ability to read the text is about the same as my first kindle which i still have but all the effort to make it more jazzy has resulted in it being harder to navigate on my keyboard kindle the books i have active in my library are listed in text one look and i can see 10 of the books i have that i intend to readflip to thr next page and i can see 10 more all i have to do to call one up is to highlight it and push the ok button when im done and want to archive the book that is easliy done and it no longer appears in the list if i want to recall an archived book all i have to do is go to the archive listing and recall it simple straightforward to find a book with the touchscreen display i have to navigate through many books depicted as bookcovers to find the book i want if you have a number of books in the queue that is time consuming and frustrating and i can find no easy way to recall a book that has been deleted from the bookshelf snazzy graphics but a lot more work on the plus side the battery lasts longer in the end i like my keyboard kindle better,not an improvement to the user
4.0,amazon got it right this time the fonts are crisp and the page turning is very responsive not sluggish like the pws i just wish they would bring back texttospeech in an eink model again i know the fires have them and i still have an old touch and kk lying around but it seems theyve abadoned it on newer models other than that its lovely apparently even the highpriced voyage doesnt have it either that said the kindle is great and if youre looking for something light and with long battery life to take around with you you cant go wrong here for the money,love it but miss texttospeech
3.0,the good we got this item on sale so the overall pricing worked for my family the adjustable fonts and bookmarks work very well like how some books will tell you how much time you have left at your current pace till you finish the chapterthe soso every now and again when you turn the page it just gets lost and you find yourself 34 pages beyond where you expected hard to reproduce this issue but 3 people in my family have had it happened to themthe bad this device has a known wifi issue my netgear wifi spot supports compaq xp laptop hp 7 laptop xubuntu laptop android tablet chumby a friends mac book an htc rythme and ironically the bn nook but this kindle will not connect talked with amazon support and went through the entire process but nothing worked has something to do with long passwords and not broadcasting the ssid thats why i gave this device 3 starswe decided to keep it because you can download the books via usb cable and we are going to buy books anyway so the difference in price paper vs ebook will cover the kindle in 15 books just wish the wifi would work,the good we got this item on sale so the 
5.0,this was my original reviewamazon has sent me a kindle in which all text is in russian i called the help desk and a very patient tech and an increasingly impatient me tried to figure out how to reset this device so that i could use it unfortunately neither of us speak this language and the device itself seemed to have a lot of inactive options it has occurred to me that this device was originally used by a russian person who sent it back and that amazon then sent it to me as new this kindle probably didnt work for that russian guy either which is why he got rid of ittheni called amazon the same day that i received the above item and they sent out a replacement the next day response was prompt and courteous despite my intemperate review received new item within a week of calling new kindle works fine review upgraded to five stars,needed to be replaced

3.0,loved my old kindle touch i feel like ive downgraded with this its much more difficult to sort and access docs and books than in the old system dont get me wrong it works fine but i dont feel that its nearly as user friendly which surprised me you have to choose collections or books by recent you cant get both frustrating to me ive had 6 kindles and i am less happy than ever with the newer software and device other than that great battery and other options miss the audio as well,loved my old kindle touch
1.0,like my new kindle,one star
5.0,my arthritis in my hands was making it difficult to hold my kindle fire hd and even books this new kindle is wonderful its easy to hold super light wait and very easy to read this new kindle is now number 4 in my household wonderful product thanks,new kindle 6 inch glare free touchscreen display with wifi
5.0,its so much lighter than either of the previous kindles ive owned this is my third i had one of the early models then a kindle fire which i still use for audio and video and slightly smaller easier to carry around easier to hold for long periods of reading with the wifi off it seems to stay charged for a very long time i normally recharge regularly but ive had it go several days with heavy reading and no recharge and the battery icon shows barely any reduction in power very pleased with this,my favorite kindle
5.0,this was a replacement for my previous kindle which i accidentally broke so im already a big fan of these devices this one contains newer features which makes it somewhat easier to use including swipe technology,a big fan of kindle
5.0,i wanted an ereader that i could read outside in the sun this is perfect for that i do miss having a backlight and may end up getting the kindle paperwhite but for now this is wonderful i do have a fire tablet that i can use indoors in the evenings when the light is dimmer but the tablets battery length is not good so i prefer to read with the kindle that has an excellent battery life,perfect for outdoors
5.0,i bought this so that i could read while at the beach and pool on vacation i love my ipad but i cant read it in the sun the kindle is very easy to read in even the brightest sunlight i love the way it seamlessly syncs with my ipad iphone i would highly recommend it to anyone who might be trying to read outside,i love my ipad
4.0,for the cost its a great device the only improvement i would make is in the visual quality of the reading material it is a bit grainy and so i feel like it somewhat cheapens the subjective experience of reading but for the price i cant complain too much i am very thankful for its affordability still prefer to read from my tabletquality nook,good for its price
5.0,we got this for our 5 yr old for christmas i love that she can use her kindle free time on it and read all of those books also shes a beginner reader but she cant put it down and loves it this is just a starter one for her to make sure she will take care of it before we upgrade her i really like how i can leave the free time on so that when she turns it on its already on the freetime and she needs a password to get out of it cant make any purchases while its on free time,love it
5.0,i have a kindle fire and a kindle hd neither of which are easy to read outside in full sun light with a special offer on the kindle 6 i got a very good price for a simple reader that i can take to the beach with me or outside on my lunch break and read to my hearts content under sunny skies i have not yet used all the extras on this one but its just what i was looking for,neither of which are easy to read outside in full sun light
5.0,i had to replace my kindle paperwhite from years ago because it really just died from me using it all the time i absolutely loved it and because of the kindle i enjoyed reading again this version is not that different except the fact that it is smaller in size which is a positive there is no keyboard on the front and it has improved technology as far as speed and response is concerned i am a paper white lover because i can read it inside or on a beach without any glare or restrictions to content you can control the font size and spacing which makes it very versatile for readers of any age buying content from amazon and having it whisper to my device is pure love kindle seriously makes reading on the go fun and simple you connect it using your wifi and you are good to go one time connection and you are set if you are looking for night reading you will need to purchase a light attachment as this kindle does not have a nightlight of any kindit comes packaged like any other kindle stabilized and safe easy to open and battery life to get you started i actually used my kindle for weeks on the battery life provided initially talk about unwrap and go i did get the one with ads but those do not bother me as my original kindle had the same thing i purchased this for a great price during the amazon prime day and i am loving every second of it i also purchased a case to protect it from unnecessary dings when carrying it in my bagoverall a great buy and i will have this one until it dies and i am forced to buy another one,i absolutely loved it and because of the kindle
1.0,piece of crap i had kindle fire that charging port went bad on so i get this since i mostly just read with it anyway i have not had it on 2 minutes and i hate it there is an adt ad on the lock screen not just lock but the permanent idle screen so long as device is on thats what you see and when it unlocks there is an adt ad at bottom of home screen are you freaking kidding me adt has nothing to do with reading and its an ad on a device that good money was paid to have on top of that the screens are not seamless there is a flicker that occures when you change pages crap dont waste your money and if you got it for christmas get the gift receipt,piece of crap i had kindle fire that charging port went

5.0,i have one of the very first kindles and i love it i have always loved to read and over the years i have kept my kindle very busy i received my kindle as a gift from my daughter at a time when my eye sight was getting poor i was diagnosed with armd and was finding it hard to enjoy my books kindle to the rescue i was able to go into the kindle and increase the print size to one that i was able to see and i have been able to continue enjoy a hobby i have had all my life and i dont have to go hunting for the books i want to read to be published in to large print format i can do it myself and read what ever i want i would not give up my kindle for anything, have one of the very first kindles and i love it i have always loved to read and 
3.0,i finally bought a kindle after having a nook for several years as a prime member i thought this would be a good valuethe kindle is composed of a hard slippery plastic with angled edges this configuration is unpleasant to hold and requires a cover the nook has a rubberized back with smooth corners which is comfortable to holdthe touchscreen of this device is not very responsive and requires that the reader forcefully jab the screen my nook is quite responsive as a prime member i looked forward to borrowing books as part of my subscription the selection is disappointingalthough i have not used this service yet borrowing from the public library straight to the device is stated to be easy this compares to the nook books must be downloaded from a pc all in all the new kindle is lacking even compared to a 4 year old nook i am deliberating returning this device,i thought this would be a good value the kindle is composed of a hard 
5.0,i love this thing great for reading books no light so it wont hurt your eyes even when reading for hours if you have wifi you can buy books online and if you have amazon prime you can get a free book every month,awesome
5.0,i started with the kindle fire and got this second its much nicer reading books on this unitit is lighter youll irritate your handswrist holding the fire steady for hours at a timeit doesnt overhead the fire overheats if you use it for graphics heavy stuff if you put it in a case so it stays propped up you can overheat until the unit shuts downits smaller than the fire easier for me to grab the unit much lower risk of dropping itits got a glare free screen read outdoors in daylight again read at night with a reading light the traditional wayno blue light in your eyes at night i confess it was affecting me and i refused to believe i was getting insomnia until i switchedless distracting the browser is bw and awkward to use there are no apps finally finish reading those bookspage speed is good paging backward is touchyyou touch the top of the screen to call up the controls this is good its less awkward than the fire where you touched the middlereasonable selection of fonts and sizeswish listthe black print on gray background isnt high contrast the better the light the easier to read i wish id ordered a paperwhite or i had a decent reading lightbattery life unlike the fire this battery really hangs onto its charge if unused its fine on its own for a week under heavy use 6 hoursday you will want to recharge every third day just long enough to forget to charge you cant read and charge if the battery is completely drainedthe width of the plastic edge next to the screen is just wide enough to make touching the screen for the page turn a bit of a hop for your fingerthe library is presented as a list which you can sort by title author recent etc this isnt all that helpful the larger your collection the more you need the book cover to help your memory you need to open the book to see the cover a thumbnail would be so usefulthe kindle doesnt always break lines at the most aesthetically pleasing breakpoint you may be left with half the line empty while the rest of the page is filled this is obvious at the larger fontsthe usb cord used for recharging is pretty short it is difficult to reach most outlets while reading charging from a computer is slowi recommend calibre shareware if you want to read files on your device calibre will convert the file to kindlecompatible format and load it onto the machineso much lighter and less distracting than the fire ive left the fire at home for a month now and i dont miss itlets face it i use the fire for playing games now,this one is for reading
5.0,this device is great and lightweight i was very interested in purchasing a kindle when they first came out and i was still in school so i didnt have the funds i recently received this for my birthday and i was able to use it on my trip out of town i downloaded a ton of books and was always able to pull it out when i was bored or waiting,best thing since since the printing press
2.0,the new kindle often does not reopen at the last page read and does nor always retain the font size that i prefer when i turn it off and reopen it both very annoying my old one never behaved that way in fact i complained about it i think its a defect and was told someone would get back to me but nobody ever did,a major step backward
5.0,since my oldest kindle is going on 5 years i took advantage of amazons sale of the basic kindle to make sure i had a backup i have been extremely pleased with it and use it for both outdoor and indoor reading the lack of page turn buttons has not bothered me at all since i have a kindle fire for reading in dark places and am used to turning pages without buttons,kindle is a wonder of technology at a low price
1.0,i am very very dissatisfied with thisi purchased it because my faithful nofrills kindles pageturning button finally wore out it has been nothing but trouble since day onethe touch screen is capricious alternating between overly sensitive and unresponsive there are days when it seems like im spending more time resetting the text size than i am reading because when i touch to turn the page the fontsize adjust bar comes up instead of the next page for example a little while ago i was reading and had to fix the font 14 times over 2 page turnsi really dislike the current layoutit used to be that i could put my items into collections and if i was in collection view i could not only see the list of collections but also items that werent yet in a collection now the only way to see uncategorized items is to put it into the all view and the area button is so small that it often takes 1020 tries to change the viewi hated it from the moment it arrived and i am so so sorry i let customer service talk me into keeping iti would have done better to spend the money to repair the old kindle,very unhappy with this product
5.0,i purchased this from groupon when it is on sale only cost me 70 including shipping i am very satisfied with this ereaderat first i thought it is going to some cheap plastic uesd on this model because it looks bad on the picture however it neither feels or looks cheap at all it is very solid and comfortable to hold and the back does not collect your finger print at all personly i think this is much better than the kindle voyage you dont need a cover for this reader it gives you a solid feeling that it wont break and even if it breaks you can get another one for 79 unlike the kindle voyage which i have to treat carefully because of the piano part can easily get scratched when you put the kindle voyage in a cover it is going to be heavier than this basic verisionthe screen looks amazing i cant tell the difference between this one and the kindle voyage the difference is marginal and for general reading trust me you wont need 300ppisave 120 on the ereader and spend them on booksi love this thing 5 star,dont get tricked by the picture they are putting high quality plastic on this
1.0,this device is impossible to use with one hand unless you dont mind it constantly hitting the floor and giving your fingers a constant work out the back is made from a cheap plastic that has effectively no friction which would be okay if you didnt have to remove your thumb from where in previous version your thumb could both hold the kindle steady and turn pages without ever having to move from the edge that holds it steady to swipe on the touch screenthe touch zones arent intuitive and the fact that you need to cover some of the text with your hand to turn the page is infuriating was anyone complaining that the previous screen didnt randomly change font size and page number for your when the the device slipped out of your hand no okaythis is getting returned in a hurry youre better of buying an older generation that was designed for reading books rather than selling more units,youre better of buying an older generation that was designed for 
1.0,i have a second generation kindle that lasted two years with very very light use it was fine when it was new but now when i try to use it whether or not it will actually open is hit and miss mostly miss it wants to reboot almost every time its turned on and occasionally it will reboot in the middle of being used sometimes it magically turns itself on without being asked to which of course runs the battery down so that the next time i pick it up theres no juice amazon help has given me instructions on how to reboot using the charger but that doesnt always work even if it did who wants an ereader for which one has to carry the charger at all times a friend of mine has a fire that refused to take a charge a few days after the 1year warranty expired she bought an ipad im buying the cheapest version kindle available only because ive already paid for a large number of books that i havent yet read and some others that ive read but want to keep for reference if i werent so invested in books for it theres no way id buy another kindle,kindles are junk

5.0,so convenient love it easy screen to read terrific buy i am so glad i was pressured to trade up to the more modern version by the old one developing a blank spot in the upper left hand corner,serendipity leads to satisfaction
5.0,i had the old original kindle and dropped it off the table i absolutely loved it and mourned its loss i upgraded to a kindle fire but this kindle was on sale so i bought this too as a back up extra for the family its better than the old one since its touch screen i sitll use it at times over my fire since it holds a battery charge longer,great item
5.0,i love my kindle its so easy for me to carry everywhere easy to read under the sun at the beach great while you are waiting at your doctors appointment and for me in particular i love to download my college notes into the kindle to take everywhere and study whenever i have the chance without having to carry my computer or have my eyes irritated by the glare of my tablet i used to have a previous generation kindle and the only complaint i had about it was that it was tedious to go through the words with the up and down arrow to highlight something or write a note this is solved by this generation with the touchscreen such a timesaver,so happy with the improvements in this generations kindle
3.0,this model is pretty much the same as the one i bought 5 years ago and it does the job just no frills a basic kindle i bought it with a special offer and it was quite inexpensive the touch screen is very touchy when i read at night with an itty bitty night light attached to the kindle tiny flying insects attracted to light land on the screen and have enough touch to turn the pages tapping the screen too hard turns multiple pages at once,a basic model kindle
3.0,i am really still adapting i had a kindle a few years ago and it seemed easier to navigate and the pictures were clearer for night reading i use the ipad kindle app which seems easier to navigate tooso the big appeal is the non glare screen for now great for deckpoolside and the beach,love the non glare screen
5.0,this is my first kindle and i love it the screen is greatno glare even in the sun which i appreciated the size is handy i finally ordered a cover to protect it but it seems sturdy in spite of being dropped a couple of times the charge lasts for hours and its easy to download books one more thing the touch screen is awesome,this is my first kindle and i love it the screen is greatno glare even in 
5.0,great things really do come in small packagesi own a hd and a hdx both great learning devices but this simple kindle is what i needits easy on the eyes i can read for hours without eyestrain light weight and the ideal size for reading while traveling email works the experimental browser does the job this little beauty displays exactly like a paperback with the added perk of font enlargementthis is my new best friend i dont go anywhere without it thanks amazon,this kindle cares about your eyes
4.0,very good reader much faster and easier to use than the old kindle touch screen is easy to read but no better than the older kindle readers the brighter the light the better the print shows up battery life is really great i took off one star because it doesnt have an audio capability it wont read to you like the kindle touch remember this is a reader if you want the best deal on a tablet get the kindle fire hd6,very good reader much faster and easier to use than 
5.0,i bought this for my nine year old granddaughter she absolutely loves it easy to use for a child no glare the size is great very pleased with this item this was a christmas gift easy for a nine year old to use i will probably upgrade when shes a little older to a tablet but this is very good for her age,couldnt be more pleased
5.0,i have been reading kindle books on my ipad mini for a couple of years now and its ok just when im outside or at a conference that its truly horrible when the eink 6 kindle went on sale for 50 i jumped on it man is that screen nice i have grown tired of freemium games and dont use office on my ipad as much as i used to so between this kindle and my cell phone i really dont have to tote around my ipad as much anymoresooo glad i made this purchase,just when im outside or at a conference that its truly horrible when the eink 6 kindle went on sale

2.0,difficult to see the background is grey not enough contrast,two stars
4.0,im not a huge fan of touchscreen devices though this one has its pluses and minuseson the positive side its easy to put items into collections i wish i could dragdrop items but being able to click check boxes and easily type is a positive the ability to select different font types and sizes is nice and you can easily add bookmarks my kindle just updated within the past few days and added the bookerly font which is amazons font specifically designed for kindle its nice but i prefer palatino out of the options available so i stuck with what i already liked the price is good and it can hold a lot of books the screen is also easy to read even outside in bright lighton the negative side the touchscreen is really sensitive if i bump the kindle all of the sudden my font is huge and then i have to make it smaller again or ill find myself on another page i appreciate the ease on turning pages but constantly having to readjust my font every time my cat decides to bump the kindle or if i put it facedown on my lap for a moment is really frustrating there also isnt a built in light on this model so you need to get a booklight or make sure that you have adequate light to read withoverall its a good kindle but i miss my buttons i just couldnt afford the version of the kindle that actually has buttons now,a good kindle even though i hate touchscreens
4.0,this is my first kindle although i have had computers since the mid80s as well as ipods and iphones i always liked to read books with real paper i liked the feel of them to look back at earlier passages at times in short to read real books not online books however i have accumulated too many books and ive run out of space i even developed an allergy to old book dust so my dilemma was this i joined a book club and we read some very interesting books but the last thing i need is more books given all that i decided to try kindle the glarefree screen seemed like a good idea since my eyes get tired from too much time on the computer and i particularly liked not having to charge yet another device daily so the two week battery life time sounded promising both of these features were a good idea and the price wasnt bad eitherupdate some pros and cons that werent initially apparent the screen is a little darker than i had expected not as bright as a new paperback but still is very readable free books werent as available as i had hoped i signed up for kindle unlimited but found that none of the book club books were on it i then got a library card and discovered downloads the first book was found and i thoroughly enjoyed reading it on kindle it made it easy to read just a bit at a time if i didnt have much time kindle plus an amazon recommended cover were a bit heavy to hold up in bed which sometimes affected my wristfingers but i still found it interesting to read in this way the next book however was much more difficult to access it was not on kindle unlimited or the lending library and although it was in my home library as a download this kind of kindle cant read the download only kindle fire can read it an amazon issue that i wish they would resolve i finally went through a lot of trouble and registered for a 3m cloud account and was able to download the book to my desktop computer same issue with kindle fire being ok but not this kindle but thats no way to read a book if i had owned an ipad that would have worked but for now my kindle is idle to be continued,i mostly like it but im not abandoning books yet
4.0,i had an older kindle with a keypad and buttons and i was curious to try out a newer model i figured that one could go with me on trips and the other could stay at homethe new charging cord is an annoyance i much prefer the old white long kindle cord i could charge the kindle while reading in bed not so with the much shorter black cord its not a big deal but an annoyancethis kindle works fine and does what it says i dont see much of a difference from my keyboard version the page turning is pretty handy although it took a while to make it work all the time thats not a kindle problem thats my problemone thing that i find very very annoying is the incredible sensitivity of the screen i have had kleenex tissue hit the screen and change the page or more usually change the fonts ive fallen asleep while reading and the kindle hitting the mattress or a blanket hitting the page will bring up a dictionary or change the fonts or activate something im used to this behavior but it is pretty annoyingthe only other problem i had was getting my books installed on the kindle from the amazon cloud on the old kindle everything was sorted into collections but when i attempted to bring things down on the new kindle it was all messed up and confused this is probably the most serious issue i ran into but some patient work has things sorted out,good but some minor issues
5.0,this is my perfect kindle and im enjoying it as much as i can glarefree is the one for me sure i had to get a lamp but its easier on my eyes then that lit screen im more than happy thanks,reading perfection
5.0,i love it ok i read a lot for me it is an experience the way a book feels in your hands the smell of the pages and of course the story itself this kindle reads very much like a book while i dont get the full on experience that i so love i still have no complaints about it at all it cuts down on the clutter to because i dont have so many book shelves of books how ever i do still buy my favorites as a physical book great job amazon now all it needs is that new book smell ,much better than reading on a regular tablet including the kindle fire
5.0,i am in love with my kindle ive had it for 24 hours and i cannot put it down its lightweight and easy to use i can navigate through my book list wish list and the special offers on the kindle a cool feature that i found myself using is the dictionary feature where im able to have a word defined in a matter of seconds although it doesnt have the builtin light the touch can be used in fluorescent lighting or natural there truly is no glarei highly suggest this ereader for all readers from the not so much of a reader to the bookworm its an amazing product that everyone will fall in love with,kindle touch
5.0,i really like this kindle it was a great value and meets the need for my reading it claimed that the screen protects your eyes compared to other screen like ipad i chose this because of that reason though it didnt have led light i feel its great for reading under regular light i dont want to hurt my eyes by reading books without lightthe cable is easy to use for charging and transferring files there are many sources out there for kindle besides amazon it is really convenient to buy on amazon though you can also send files to the kindlethe capacity is about 4 gigabytes you can store a lot of books it is small and light i like this very much for daily readingi also used my account and bought a papers white for my roommate she likes hers too she likes reading late night thats why she got the paper white if you dont like to read in dark you can try this one its a great deal,good deal
5.0,im obsessed with my reader it was hard for me to decide like everyone else when deciding to buy an ereader i wanted something simple something that wouldnt distract me like getting on other apps i strictly wanted a device to only read with and i found it its perfect size weight and ever though it doesnt have a back light i dont have issues seeing the font in dim light it easy to use and i really enjoy it,simply to read with
5.0,my new kindle is so much lighter than my old one and the plastic case will be good for my fingers in the middle of winter the metal case of my old one gets really cold i really like the new way to turn it off and i have been using it for a couple weeks straight and havent had to recharge it yet i am waiting to see how long it will go with one charge, my old one and the plastic case will be good for my fingers in the middle of winter the 
5.0,easy to read for old eyes i can set the backlight to high for maximum contrast as well as select large font better that the paper of a booki only hope that maps and photos have better clarity than my old kindle which renders photos and maps unreadable,good for us old folks
4.0,read one book who knows ask me after 100 g,four stars

1.0,returned it and ordered a kindle fire hd,returned
3.0,i like to turn the pages with the button,three stars
1.0,not very good at all very hard to read,lousy product very difficult to read
2.0,couldnt brighten screen enough for me,couldnt brighten screen enough for
5.0,love my kindlesthis one is a gift,five stars
1.0,there is no brightness control total waist of money if you ever read in lower light or dark to be honest it is hard to read in regular light page seems to dark this is my 4th kindle and i love all my other ones due to the ability to change brightness or paper white i got this for the wifi for my daughter but not even worth having it with no brightness she could just read the paperback if that is the case,buyer beware no brightness option
5.0,i think i had the 4th or 5th gen device before a unhappy accident i got over it though when i got my hands on the 7th gen first impressions i thought it felt thicker and a little heavier which it is and i like lot 7 grams makes it perfect turning on the device was also noticeably different same amount of pixels but the e ink pearl it makes for easier reading its a win whatever is underhood in processing makes for faster page turns i also read on my phone and tablet when i dont have my kindle and reading off those devices for extended periods give me a headache no headaches with this device i dont know about all that blue light research keeping you up but i try to listen to the experts and since this device is not back lit and requires me to have a reading lamp i often fall asleep late reading and all signs point to no deprivation of sleep from my brain being overly active the technology will only get better as cost for better screens 300dpi get cheaper but for now for the cost and what is available books wise this is as good as it gets for an ereader,this is a ereader not a tablet and this 7th gen is the best possible reading experience
5.0,i bought this kindle for me as sort of a new year resolution as i really want to start reading more books this kindle is very easy to use and it doesnt hurt my eyes as when i read on a computer screen or on a tablet in fact i just spent last 3 days straight reading a novel on the kindle and i didnt get the red eyes i usually get by staring at a computer screen for a dayalso i would like to comment on amazons outstanding customer service after reading on my kindle for a few days i noticed a small black spot the size of a fruit fly on my screen after close examination it turned out to be some dead pixels i actually bought my kindle from jetcom and not directly from amazon but figured id ask amazon what to do they sent me a replacement through 2 day shipping no questions asked not even the proof of purchase of course i think by my registering my device they probably got all the data yet still what a piece of mind to know when you buy something from a company who would stand behind their product,great product outstanding customer service
4.0,great little device i got it for my elderly mother and the screen seems to be extremely sensitive if she barely hovers her finger nail over the screen it will change she finds this very frustrating i hope they come out with a way to make it not quite so sensitive so those who are older can use it more effectively for me it works great,great little device
4.0,ive used the kindle app on my phone for years but always found the temptation to do other things too strong especially when those email notifications pop up the glarefree display isnt completely glarefree but does wellespecially compared to the glossy screen on my phone the lack of a backlight could be seen as a detriment to some but i see it as preventing sleeping problems that may be linked to the blue tint of most led backlightsthe ads are not too bad since i have a case but i still might pay the extra to remove them im definitely a satisfied customer,great for reading books
4.0,still trying to figure everything outand im not convinced that this will replace books for meit just doesnt have the weightbut it is very readable and i like being able to increase the font size,kindle
4.0,i bought this for my mother in her late 70s and is was too difficult for her to understand and move like the older model she liked the page turning of the more manual model and could not chapter tab of close and open without my help too big of a change and confusing for someone her age, was too difficult for her to understand and move like the older model
3.0,had to send it back could not download games,three stars
5.0,this was an upgrade for me from the original kindle so i am happy no it does not have a light thats ok i do wish since it doesnt have a light there was a case like the my original one that has built in light in the case it self thats all its small and light and compact,great reader
2.0,screen is to dark disappointed with lighting😕,two stars
5.0,if you havent used a kindle before let me tell you this device is going to feel weird it really does look like a paperback book with the slightlyoffwhite display if youre expecting it to look like a tablet well it doesnt exactly no this device looks like a book but with electronic programming that allows it to actually be hundreds or even thousands of booksthis kindle was my christmas present to myself and i am delighted i had low expectations as it is a budget device if you want something with more features youre going to have to shell out more money but if youre looking for an inexpensive way to collect books and carry them all in a single pocket this will get the job doneedit for more informationive been using my kindle for 16 days now and still have yet to charge it for this reason alone i see it as a valuable investment its an electronic but its not something im going to have to remember to charge i read almost every night on this thing and i still love it every single ebook makes me more satisfied with my purchase,great for book lovers
3.0,i wish it had a light so i could read at night,three stars
5.0,i have enjoyed reading kindle books on my ipad and later my ipad mini for quite some time my problem with these devices has always been the weight when reclining in bed this kindle solves that problem because it is much lighter and with a little ingenuity i have really improved on it a silicon bracelet fits nicely over one edge to insert my ring and pinky underneath in the back leaving my birdie finger and index to steady the top my thumb is free to effortlessly turn pages while my left hand can work the menus if needed i added a matching bracelet to the other side for an even look that doubles as a rubbery protector,a great solution
2.0,ive had four paperwhites and have liked them so much that ive given each one away and bought anotherthis version doesnt have a backlight which limits its utility to brightly lit spaces im not sure which genius decided to cut out this feature but he or she would be better served working in the fast food industry,no backlight argh
5.0,ive been reading on kindle fire tablets for a few years now i switched to this because staring at the screen for long periods of time was hurting my eyes this is definately better on your eyes i read a lot of complaints about the fact that this one isnt back lit i havent found that to be a problem you can read the screen anywhere you would be able to read an actual book its basically a calculator screen so if youre unsure get a calculator and try to use it where you plan to be reading if you can read the screen youll be able to read this the touchscreen works a little bit differently than my kindle fire but i eventually got used to it amazon says that this battery lasts for weeks if you only read half an hour a day i spend two or three hours a day and ive been charging it once a week or so the battery is usually down to about 60 by then all and all im glad i switched to this kindle,a good switch
1.0,i was disappointed that it does not have the ability for sound i did not realize that when i bought it or i would have apply the money to one with sound,disappointed
3.0,i really miss to be able to read in the dark,three stars
1.0,i would have preferred at some backlighting,one star
3.0,fairly good purchase no headphone option,three stars
3.0,do not buy if you want to read in the dark youll need to get the paper white,cant read in dark
1.0,do not like it can not download free games,one star
4.0,i bought this kindle for my mother for christmas i didnt want it to have a lot of bells and whistles on it because she is nervous about electronics she has had it for over a week now and only had to have me come over and fix it as she says once i am very happy that it looks like a real book as she loves to read it was a good purchase and has made her happy for christmas thank you amazon for your amazing products,i am very happy that it looks like a real book as she 
3.0,touch screens can be difficult for this elderly person especially when there isnt a younger generation person close to help teach me i find that one thing not so easy as on my first kindle ls the library listing by book covers rather than in print it will take awhile to be comfortable with it but the reading is great before all the push to immediately get another from the same author or type,difficult for the elderly
5.0,i love it my husband and kids got it for me for mothers day it is exactly what i wanted in a ereader i have had several different tablets including the kindle fire and i just didnt like all the extra stuff i ended up giving one to my mom and the other to my oldest son the fire and other tablet i had was too heavy they were useless if you were outside and i didnt like the constant notifications for games email and such the kindle ereader is super light weight and very comfortable to hold it had a generic web browser if you wanted to do minimal web browsing but i see no need to use it i love love xray i also like the easy access to the store and good reads if you want movies and games as well the fire is the way to go we also have the fire kids and my youngest son loves it i like it as well and you can switch it to an adult tablet which i will use if i want movies and such but that is not too often however i do not like all that extra stuff all the time i want to be able to take my book with me and not have it take up too much room and be able read without interruptions so if you do not want or need all the extra stuff and simply want to read wherever you go then this is defiantly for you,i love it my husband and kids got it for 
1.0,after a kindle fire i find this device insufficient,one star
4.0,as an avid lifelong reader of books i wasn’t sure i’d like the kindle and was unwilling to invest much i bought this one during the black friday sale for 4999 a price that finally convinced me to try it what i like the light weight and compact size are perfect and it fits easily into a pocket of my handbag for travel pageturning is simple and the screen is very easy on the eyes in decent lighting as a senior i love love love being able to adjust the font size the charge lasts a long time and it recharges quickly using my computer’s usb port buying books on amazon is very easywhat i’m still getting used to the edges around the screen are narrow except at the bottom and i haven’t yet found a way to hold the kindle comfortably for long periods i’ve come close to dropping it several times especially if i doze off while reading it would be nice to have a stretchy fabric strap on the back to slip my hand through i’m not used to touch screens don’t care for them and the kindle’s is very sensitive so i tend to accidentally activate features i don’t want enter multiples of letters while searching or send myself to mysterious locations in the book and have to find my way back i don’t use social media or other sharing features all i do is buy and read so all in all it’s an excellent value for a new user four stars instead of five is because of the toosensitive touch screen,great value for entry level
3.0,kind of small and i hate that theres no backlight,cant read on plane or at night
5.0,the product is a great especially for the price this kindle holds a large number of books it is touch screen and easy to work and there was plenty of help from amazon in getting it set up and working the product was delivered earlier than expected and the battery life of this machine is greater than the earlier model my wife has a kindle fire because she plays games and looks things up but i wanted an ebook and for me this one is just great,the product is a great especially for the price
3.0,the product is ok to readbut it was not very cheap,three stars
5.0,as long as you know how ebooks and displays work this one is quite good ive read a handful of books on it in a week and its easy to read simple to change anything you wish and goes a long time between charges at the price its unbeatable,6 kindle good stuff
2.0,didnt realize so much smaller than my kindle fire,two stars
5.0,i am enjoying the new kindle theres some adjustment comparing my old keyboard style with the touch screen it is smaller so it fits in my purse better no color but this is for reading only which is what i needed it for mine has the ads on it no problem there either it syncs in with my fire and old kindle thats convenient but it has been a little confusing to get books on the new one from the old ones but that may be a matter of getting used to the new system if you just want to read books this is perfect if you want to get on the internet get the fire both are great,it is smaller so it fits in my purse better no color but this is for reading only 
1.0,waste of money i would of prefered to buy a tablet,one star
5.0,this is a great device and worth well above the asking priceive had a kindle ereader of some sort ever since the kindle keyboard 3rd gen came out and enjoy keeping up with the latest device i had recently dislocated my gray kindle touch and got this as a replacement its way faster than the original touch ever was and seems to have a much better battery life the screen quality seems to be about the same and the menus mimic the latest in the paperwhitefor an entry level device you cant really go wrong sure there is no backlight but then they have the paperwhite,wow so much faster than the original kindle touch and a better value
2.0,kindle for 59 cheap you get what you pay for,kindle for 59 cheap you get what you 
5.0,ive previously owned 2 used 1st gen kindles and loved them until they died for lack of use too much work not enough time to read i splurged and bought the new kindle 7 and i love it took it to the lake over the weekend for a picnic and read the whole time it was sunny and warm enough for me to get a slight sunburn but i never had a problem with glare on the screen the touch screen display is awesome and takes a little getting used to but i love that too could have paid 20 more for the kindle fire but for a person who spends10 hours a day on a computer that was the last thing i neededi just needed a book that didnt weigh 10 lbs stephen king so that i could take it anywhere anytime,love my new kindle
3.0,dont like all the advertising on my kindle,three stars
5.0,for many years i refused to consider purchasing a kindle reader because holding a book in my hands was a nice familiar routine for me i eventually gave in and bought this product in late 2015 but still held off on using it until february 2016 now that ive used it for a month i wonder why in the heck i waited so long to buy one i love the convenience of this product its lightweight goes a very long time without the need for charging the battery and i really like the fact that i can adjust text size for maximum reading comfort the only thing i had a little trouble getting used to was the fact that there is no brightness adjustment on this model but i learned that it just takes some time to get accustomed to using it im probably only using a third of its features but thats enough for me to say that i really like itand highly recommend it,love the convenience and features of this product
1.0,need a light very disappointed that i could not return the kindle since it was over 10 days,need a lighted screen
1.0,no directions at all in the box so it just sits,you can do much better
1.0,if i was not so crippled with pain id return it,dont buy
1.0,i am the wife on the account i have had several kindles but this was the worst promised new features did not live up to expectations miserable to use by being forced to change pages with one hand i have a second generation kindle that does not have a lot of bells and whistles but pages can be easily turned with a click of a button from either relaxed hand the screen is great and can be read in sunlight bring something like it back with all the best new features and then it would be worth buying another,big disappointment
5.0,really great reader in the sun almost think its a better reader in the sun than in a normally lite room very happy with the basic functionality of this model kindle have an ipad already and didnt want a reader with internet access thereby enabling me to stray of course from reading periodically doesnt actually flick pages like a book instead there are 3 quadrants that you simply tap to change pages fwd or back or pull down main menu overall it meets the needs of this basic reader myself,solid ereader for the novice book reader
3.0,wasnt what i expected did not have a light up screen,three stars
5.0,tablets are a common sight in our household at last count i think we had over six floating around here yet my wife was still reading bound books she loves reading and cannot fathom giving up the feel of a book in her hands but she is open to utilizing a tablet form and has read books with the kindle app on other branded tablets enter prime day and the really good deal that was offered for the kindle 6 i ordered it for her as a just because surprise hoping shed at least be somewhat excited that i thought of her she was and has already downloaded her first book and is well into it in just 24 hours she loves the ease in holding the unit the contrast of the screen and the simplicity of browsing choosing and downloading books to read she stated that she will always read the traditional book but this kindle has certainly opened up many options for herthis is a great item for someone who wants to carry many and i do mean many options with them while travelling or just having it available at your bedside so light and easy to balance so hand cramps are nonexistent after a nice relaxed reading period battery charge hasnt budged in a whole day with just over an hour of constant use we highly recommend this to any avid reader or perhaps even someone who may need a nudge toward reading more,affordability and practicality rule this kindle ease of use and comfort explain why
1.0,it is horrible its in chinese my kids can even use it,one star
5.0,ive held off for years in favor of traditional books before finally breaking down and getting a kindle granted its kinda bottom of the line but i usually start small taking baby steps and i couldnt pass up the deal of 59 with payments broken down monthly i meanwell after some initial fumbling and poking i can honestly say where have you been all my life this goes just about everywhere with me and it has encouraged me to read more as id slacked off more than i was happy with as a starter i can tolerate the ads for now but my dream is to upgrade to a more substantial model that will allow me to do and see morei was taken aback at first because unbeknownst to me the feature that shows you what other readers have highlighted was enabled but i poked around some and saw how to turn that bad boy off it was mildly interesting at first hmm why would someone highlight that passage or line but quickly grew distractingannoying still in all ive been very pleased with the experience and have fun loading my kindle up with all kinds of reading material that i wouldnt otherwise have taken a second look at in a hard copy ive also loved the readability of the test and the ability to make the font comfortable for my eyes until an upgrade is possible for me soon pleasepleaseplease i will add a clipon light so that i can read in dimmer light as wellso if anyone else is still holding out on taking the technological jump into an ereader i say go for it i still miss the smell of a new book at times but i can always go browse in the local mega book emporiumoh and thanks to those who posted in their reviews about trying my phone charger before springing for a separate charger purchase really amazon because my android charger works like a charm,i took the plungefinally
1.0,its dark and has no light adjustment you cant read it without a lamp nearby big disappointment,no brightness adjustment
5.0,my daughter is in college and is studying for the gre she was going to get the 5 lb gre study guide i think that thats what its called but hated the thought of lugging it around with her she had wanted a kindle to make that easier but has trouble sleeping and has been reading articles about how reading backlit devices at bedtime can lead to sleep issues this kindle was the right item at the right time and right price shell be able to study in bed without staring at the backlit screen,she was going to get the 5 lb gre study guide i think that thats what its called but hated the thought of lugging it around
2.0,didnt realize the screen is not back lit kinda lame,two stars
5.0,i got my kindle for christmas and i am absolutely addicted to it i hadnt researched them before hand and my mom bought me this one so obviously i was a little shocked to see it didnt have a light because i was unfamiliar with them however it doesnt bother me at all and i think i prefer it instead lighted screens make my eyes hurt after a while and i love the look of a real printed book it is light and a little flimsy feeling but if you just get a case for it it makes it easier to hold and protects it,love it
2.0,my expectations were not met also did not need it,two stars
5.0,have secretly wanted a kindle for a long time i received one from my son for christmas and just love it no glare easy to read great features i love the xray feature especially and looking up words i carry it in my bag and can read my book at any down timewaiting at the doctors office or anywhere i am really happy with it and know ill be using it a lot its great to save money too since almost all kindle versions of books are less expensive,love it
5.0,nu,too new for my opinion yet
5.0,i love my kindle i bought one when the price dropped below 100 back in 2011 a touch screen sounded nice but physical buttons were ok by me at 79 the new touch screen kindle was definitely tempting but i resisted until thanksgiving when the price dropped to 49 two days later i had my new kindle my husband had my old one hes been a read paper books or read on the tablet or phone kind of guy two weeks later when the price dropped to 59 i asked him if he wanted santa to get him one after comparing the 2 he said yes so why this kindledesigned for readersphysical books have dark print on a light background they dont have built in lights you sit in a spot with adequate lighting and read them the same is true of this kindle of course sometimes it would be nice to be able to read in the dark or see the color in a book fortunately kindle apps are available for almost any device and amazon syncs across my devices that means i can switch to using my tablet or phone when i need color or a light for the record i dont do that very oftenease of usei really didnt mind the physical buttons on my old kindle i also dont miss them its so much easier to hold the kindle when i dont have to position my thumb on the edge of the device so i can turn the page on the relatively rare occasions when i need to type something the keyboard on the new kindle is incredibly easy to use typing on the old one was a pain in the butt getting a definition or highlighting a passage is a matter of touching the screen not repeatedly pushing a buttonadjustable fontsneed reading glasses i do sure i can read normal sized print in physical books but my kindle lets me adjust the font size to make reading easier this isnt a new feature but its easier than it used to bebattery lifethe bad news is i dont get the projected month on a charge the good news is the battery lasts days not hours amazon bases their claim on 12 hour of reading per day 15 hours per monthand leaving wifi off i spend an hour or 2 a day reading so that cuts the estimated battery life at least in half the kindle uses battery only for page turns and accessing wifi i leave wifi on i also use a larger font and i read more than 1000 wpm google says the average person reads 250300 wpm the font size and reading speed mean at least 4 times the estimated page turns battery life may not be what amazon claims but its certainly within expected parameters and it definitely beats battery life on my phone and tabletgood readsi havet previously used good reads but i do now i love that its integrated into this kindlefamily librarythis wasnt available on the old kindle i like sharing books with my husband we dont have any children in residence but the family features sound greatbuying experiencebooks dont have to cost money i usually dont go into a bookstore or a library in search of a specific book i go to a section and choose from whats available i do the same on amazon i do most of my browsing in the free best sellers list since free books dont necessarily stay free i buy whatever looks like id like it i dont always like them andor read them but i have more than 800 purchased books most of them free and all i have to take with me on the plane is my kindle of course at the bookstore i can sample the book before i buy it amazon lets me download a free sample once i buy a book amazon downloads it to my kindle in about the time it takes to read this sentence amazingother book sourcespublic libraries the selection of ebooks at my library is significantly smaller than the selection of paper books no ebooks dont cost the library nothing they are actually significantly more expensive that said the selection has definitely improved books check out for 13 weeks the process is ridiculously easy check out the book select kindle overdrive takes you to amazon where the buy button has been changed to the borrow button dont count on finishing the last chapter after lending period ends the book will stop functioning the second the lending period ends the good part of that is that there are no fines for late returnsprime lending library check out 1 qualifying book per month with no due date i have a wishlist of prime books i want to read i checked the library for them most werent availableso my free sources dont overlap this is a nice perk of prime but definitely not a reason to sign up prime books are only available on kindle devices not kindle appskindle unlimited for 999month i didnt expect to like my free trial but i did i could easily find and read more than 10 worth of books per month most all of my prime wishlist is available on kindle unlimited while i like kindle unlimited i have suspended my subscription for the moment i will probably renew periodically my husband wasnt impressed with the selection i browse bookstores he shops for a specific book kindle unlimited is more suited to browsingspecial offersas previously implied im cheap that said i did wonder about the special offers buy the kindle with so pay the 20 difference later if they bother you you will see them as a screen saver and at the bottom 12 inch of the home page you do not see them when you are actually reading i dont spend much time on the home screen i spend even less time looking at the screensaver i spend most of my time on the kindle actually reading some deals arent bad so i occasionally look at the list in the menu its definitely not worth 20 to me to get rid of them,definitely an upgrade
5.0,ok,five stars
5.0,i have had a kindle for over 4 years and used it daily almost i used it mostly for reading i find i have read over twice as many books since i first got it finally it just wore out and i purchased my current one i purchased it while in seattle over christmas vacation and have been reading steadily ever since i purchased the smaller one that fits better in my purse or carryon when i travel im not one to change whatever if what i had works for me i really like the new kindle and when it wears out will purchase the new model of kindle,i purchased the smaller one that fits better in my purse or carryon when i travel
4.0,ok,four stars
5.0,best product ever wonderful i received a kindle as a gift and loved it so much i bought three to give as gifts to three of my favorite people i always have six good books loaded and waiting to be read no more lugging around books jamming them into my purse and forgetting them somewhere heaven is having a charged loaded kindle,best product ever

1.0,dont like it at all was unable to get less than one star,one star
5.0,im happy to have found this and at such an awesome pricegetting back into the swing of reading and my tablet was just too cumbersome this is so lightweight and easier to see in the sunlight beach reading is a passion,glare free reading and so lightweight
2.0,would have preferred the kindle fire for a few dollars more,two stars
2.0,prefer my older version without the touchscreen difficult to navigate cannot go back or forward easily it constantly highligths or tries to copy a linebasically because i have not managed to move from page to page despite assurances that this was a better choice because of lower price the paper white might have been better still cannot read unless there is sufficient light and find the correct font or size for better reading not the best for a replacement reader,rather have my old reader back
2.0,t didnt have a light built in so i returned it c bourque,kindle 6 glare free
5.0,my wife and i have a couple of kindles originally i wanted the kindle fire as you could also play angry birds on it and occasionally use the internet but never used it much for this the kindle fire has a battery that lasts only a day or two the black and white kindle lasts weeksour son gave us for christmas a year ago a black and white kindle where you have the backlight alsoi bought this to replace the lost black and white kindle that my wife lost after getting it we realized that this has no backlight that means no reading at night without a light my wife loves to read at night and does not want to disturb me i usually do not read at night so i took this one and i gave her minemaybe it is a good recommendation to buy the more expensive model but this works fine if you do not plan to read at night without another light source,great price easy to read
2.0,it works well but it not backlit so you cant read at night,two stars
5.0,love it the first thing i love about this kindle is the glarefree screen it allows me to sit in my back yard and read as the sun is high in the sky the battery is the second thing that is fantastic it lasts unbelievably long i read a lot and i have only charged it twice in the month that ive had it the size is also perfect i can take it in my purse and read it anywherei highly recommend this fabulous kindle,highly recommended
1.0,do not like it black white you have to use a light lol,junk
5.0,i and my wife are avid and prodigous readers i had been reluctant to go from a paper based book to the electronic reader i have always enjoyed the weight and feel of a book in my hands with that being said the tremendous advantages of portability and the cvast selection of kindle unlimited has more than surpassed my expectationsi travel often for work and i am looking forward to not having the weight of seven or eight books in my carryon bag it is quite easy to become emeshed in reading whole series of books in an afternoon before you know it i am profound and ethusiastic supporter of the kindle,a whole new reading world in you pocket
1.0,i just bought this kindle for my 9 years old daughter 3 days ago i still cant buy or download books on it,i just bought this kindle for my 9 years old 
5.0,i have owned a kindle in the past i had the first version that came out i was excited about the fire bc it had more features it was soo buggy that i wanted to throw it against the wall i abandoned kindle altogether and just used the app on my ipad now that im out of grad school and have my summers off i wanted to revisit kindle due to the glare factor i also purchase a lot of books for work and need to reference them often it is easier to purchase theses on a kindle as opposed to having them all in hardback this is the kindle ive been waiting forpros light weight no bugs can read in the sun but still adjust the background for the home wonderful study features  dictionary this is my favorite simply touch a word you dont know and it brings up the definition  highlighting you can go to a feature in the book that will show you every passage you have highlighted its the equivalent to putting postits to mark a page but without the flipping and searching  xray this is soo helpful when you are reading a book with a lot of characters or terms simple touch the characters name and it will bring up the important information on themit has other features as well but those are my favorite you can also organize them now which is also helpful grouping the battery life is also wonderfulcons browser is slow the internet feature sucks so you are better off using a smart device or computer to purchase your booksthats honestly the only con i can think of i highly recommend this kindle its one of my favorite things,the kindle ive been waiting on
1.0,loved my old kindle cant get this stupid thing to work,one star
1.0,the new kindle was a huge disappointment as the device no longer supports audio the only device that does both is fire which does not have the antiglare screen for outdoor reading that kindle does,a huge disappointment
3.0,its okay obviously the kindle fire hd is much better,obviously the kindle fire hd is much better
5.0,i ordered my new kindle on monday and received it on wednesday so far so good no problems it operates pretty much like my old kindle touch i wore out the kindle touch it was getting very slow to turn pages and perform other functions and it had an irritating scratch on the surface from being dropped no problem transferring books from the cloud to the new kindle at the price of 59 it was a really good deal,so good no problems
1.0,liked it but plan to exchange it for one i can actually use to read at night the tablet has no backlight and is way too dark for my old eyesi thought it would be bright like my cell phone,liked it but plan to exchange it for one 
4.0,i loved my fourth generation kindle because it was pretty much a no nonsense little ereader it was also comfortable to hold for hours of reading pleasure unfortunately as such things go it finally gave up the ghost and it was time for an upgrade hence the seventh generation touchscreen its only been a week or so but ive settled in with this one the touchscreen is definitely a plus the screen is crystal clear and glare free of course there are a lot more bells and whistles with it such as goodreads integration and the quick view there were times i found such additions a bit fussy but theyre coming around my biggest complaint is how much more weight this ereader has compared to my first even with the thinnest cover i could find its still an adjustment for all that its still a nice little machine,surprised by the weight
5.0,my husband got me this for christmas and i love it ive been using the kindle app on my android devices and pcs for years im excited to finally have a real kindle d i love that its all touchscreen now i dont think i would have liked the ones with the keyboards and buttons after having used touchscreen smartphones and tablets for several years now love my kindle ,love my kindle
1.0,do not like itthe older model was much better for me,one star
5.0,i love the touch screen but am still learning all the movements,five stars
5.0,works really well during the daytime it is very simple with user friendly instructions included in the software i especially appreciate the vocabulary builder you simply touch the word on the screen it defines the word and stores it in the vocabulary builder section later you can go to the vocabulary builder and refresh your memoryron l,works really well during the daytime it is very 
1.0,just get a paperwhite this has no light to it its stupid and pointless that said i love my paperwhite its awesome,dont bother
4.0,i won this from an aarp contest i was surprised when i received it and didnt use it for a while it did come at a perfect time when my large kindle fires battery stopped charging i love how light weight and thin this isit easily fits in my purse without weighing it down i love how theres no eye glare so i can read it at night without the glare keeping me awake for a while turning pages is easy by swiping or pressing your finger on the right side of the page although sometimes by mistake i press too far to the left or swipe too close to the middle and a word or sentence is underlined and the dictionary pops up or tries tofrustrating scoring stars at the end doesnt show up on amazon so not sure why its there overall i really like this kindle and suggest it to others especially for night time reading,it did come at a perfect time when my large kindle fires battery stopped charging
3.0,this is my first ereader and first kindle so far so good i am still figuring out the navigation aspect of the device,so far so good i am still figuring out the navigation aspect 
5.0,this is my 2nd kindle i had the first edition kindle for years and left it out in the sun too long a couple weeks ago it sadly broke i immediately went out to purchase another one and i was really happy the quality was still there with a couple new upgrades i love the glare free screen my kindle is one of my favorite items and this didnt disappoint i will say i think the battery life on this version isnt as great as my first one its probably because of the touch screen,great product
1.0,poor optics for someone with 175 readers icons are too small,one star
4.0,ive been a kindle user since the original 10 version i still remember paying almost 300 for my first one ive averaged an upgrade probably every three modelsi picked this one up more because it was on sale for amazonprime day than anything else i have been using the previous version with the awkward directional button on the bottom of the screen i also use a paperwhite at night if im reading in bed because the glow doesnt overly disturb my wife trying to sleepfor reading outside this is a great device i dont think you can beat it and i dont think you need the paperwhite or voyage in order to enjoy your bookfor reading inside you lose a star it just has a dark luster to it i find myself slightly straining my eyes to read itand the touchscreen is good and bad it is fantastic for whenever you have to type in a keyboard or click a button it is okay when you have to turn a page my issue is that sometimes i accidentally turn a page because i figit with the device while reading or i want to turn the page with my left hand and cant more of a minor annoyance than a defect i think i have the same exact experience on my paperwhite but i cant bring myself to pay the extra money for the voyager,ups and downs mostly ups especially if you read outside
1.0,i wanteda tablet not a book reader it disappoints me very much,one star
5.0,i love my new kindle the display is marvelous and the soul reason i will always stick to kindle the touch screen is great and the whole set up is easy to learn i wish the home display was was designed differently but honestly i got it to read books not to stare at a home screen would absolutely recommend to everyone,the bomb
2.0,works okay but is full of ads which make it hard to navigate,two stars
5.0,i use this kindle everyday it was one of my smartest and most valuable purchases i enjoy reading more than i ever have and on the plus side even though i read at least an hour everyday the battery lasts me atleast 3 weeks on a single charge especially because i leave it on airplane mode,best purchase
1.0,i returned it because it didnt not have light to read in bed,wasnt what i was looking for
5.0,this is an upgrade from my older kindle it has taken me awhile to get used to the touch screen it seems to easily change the font size on its own i am not sure why this is happening but it is easy to change it back,it seems to easily change the font size on its own
1.0,the screen died before i even had it for 4 months othwerwise i loved it but i it was not worth it for only 4 months,i loved it but i it was not worth it 
4.0,doesnt have a backlight for reading at night cant download and play word games like the original kindle could but its great for reading which is what its intended for the screen is a little touchy with swiping your finger to turn pages but its very easy to use and figure out the battery lasts a very long time would recommend for those who like to read and arent into gamesapps plenty of free books to search for when searching the amazon store if youre upgrading to this device from an old kindle it can upload previous amazon books you bought when you link your account,good for bookworms like myself
1.0,just bought it and it already doesnt work it wont stay on,one star
5.0,i had a kindle keyboard it died my husband said most people dont use theirs 5 hours a day for 4 years this one was hard to get used to everything worked differently but after whining and grieving the loss of my last one i began to put my book into collections i transferred my older books i learned to love it i did not name it brad but i thought about it,my new kindle
4.0,this is a great deal it helps me go back to reading since its easy to carry and light i can borrow all the books if you dont mind waiting for some of the popular books from the library battery life is reasonable though i understand that it isnt possible to read in the dark with this version i do wish i got the other one instead at night but overall this is a great buy,simple great to read
1.0,poor post sales service dont buy no support after warranty period,poor post sales service dont buy
1.0,easy on eyes had surgery light weight enjoyable perfect gift,one star
4.0,i was a little reluctant about getting a kindle im sort of old fashioned and i love the feel of the paper in my hands and the smell of a brand new bookbut i am gladly surprised at how much i love my kindle i carry it with me everywhere of course the main advantage is that i can carry many books with me stored in my kindle and it doesnt weight almost anything in my pursethe basic kindle is all that an reader affictionado needs and for the price you can not go wrongi still need to figure it out how to set the size and pattern of the font in my kindle every time i turn it on it chages the size to too big or too smallthe only complaint about the purchase was the poor service with deliver im a prime member and i was expecting to have it deliver in 2 day which didnt happen also it surprised me that it was sent via snailmail and not ups i was very dissatisfied with that,i caved in and i dont regret it
1.0,i am very unhappy with this kindle you should make it clear that it is very small and certainly not suitable to anyone who has any type of trouble typing or using small keyboards etc i have purchased at least 4 kindles for myself and gifts and the only one i liked was the first one and it broke and kindle could not fix and lost half of over 125 books i had purchased so i am on the edge of if i should continue with this kindle or go back to reading the old fashioned waythank you for your attention geraldine cherney,not happy
4.0,my previous kindles allowed me to press the forward and backward button to page forward or backward the new kindle has me swipe the screen to change the page i prefer the older kindle as the new one will sometimes page ahead 34 pages,newer is not better
1.0,if like me you want aa comfortable hand sized device for ebooks or audio books look elsewhere this one only lets you download to internal storage yes you can cloud but if you dont have wifi oh well you cant save either to the sd card expanded storage had i known that i wouldnt have waisted the money on device or extra storage very disappointed,sd wont hold ebooks or audio books
5.0,works as advertised this is my 2nd kindle this one has nice touches the other model didnt have most notably the touch screen which makes the interface much better combined with very good battery life this is a solid kindle if you use your kindle for reading rather than surfing the standard kindle is much better than the colour screen models,works as advertised
1.0,i didnt like it and sent it back so far i am not seeing it posted to my account its been over the time period of the five days what i didnt like was there wasnt a way to adjust the brightness,i didnt like it and sent it back
4.0,just what i asked for but a bit of a surprise after all i use a bright colorful ipad all day long the one disadvantage is the glare when i try to read a kindle book outside impossible unless you are in the shade i bought the kindle for just this purpose the screen is not back lit if i wanted that so i could read indoors should have bought the other model and the pages are not pure white soft grey but i do like the fact i can increase the type size and adjust the page width for faster readingit does what it needs to do,kindle 6 does what its supposed tobut not much more
1.0,amazon didnt tell me there was no backlight to read in dim rooms,cant read wo room lights on
5.0,this device is exactly what i wanted for reading focus rather than general web searches this simply takes me where i need to go for book searches tap magnifying glass on drop down menu and type in search words the keyboard on the bottom half of the screen is nice and i rarely miss a key when tapping searches have been surprisingly quite fast and download speed is faster than expected even for longer books the scroll bar was tricky at first swiping down to go up and swiping up to go down light touches to the right of screen take you forward to the next page and to the left of screen take you backward to the page before and these taps need not be hard to get the pages turned the unlit screen doesnt hurt my eyes since it is lit by any light source outdoors or indoors other features as advertised such as dictionary are useful for quick look up but again not necessary for reading since i personally get easily distracted and dont want to look up words all day and i noticed two dictionaries to choose from love the feature of making words font size as big or as small as needed or allowed by putting two fingers apart an inch or two on the screen then pinching the two fingers to make font smaller or opening fingers wider from a pinch position on the screen to make font larger what a snap so very happy recommend added protection for any touch screen devices,modern and focused reading from touch and sight
2.0,returned it i like my nook better,i like my nook better
5.0,its very simple if you want something just for reading it will be perfectno glare screen i bought a light without light felt that times i can use it limitedwith prime membership i have good choice or books for myself and my 10 years old childcompare to other electronic devices i know my child can do only reading no games or any other distractions exist,good device for just reading
1.0,not happy with the product like the ios app better for reading,one star
4.0,bought this for my teen aged daughter and she loves it also bought the paper white and think its worth the extra scratch go for the paper white its just more useful with the back lit screen hands down,go for the paper white
3.0,it doesnt light up the pages so you cant read in low light,3 stars
5.0,easy to use font is very clear it is light weight and the charge lasts for a long timethe only improvement to the kindle that i could recommend concerns the charging light the light is amber while charging and green when fully charged i am colorblind so amber and green on the kindle are one and the same color to me perhaps two colors further separated on the color spectrum like blue and green would help for someone that is colorblind that isnt enough to stop me from giving the kindle 5 stars though it is a wonderful device and i thoroughly enjoy using it,excellent reading device
3.0,i returned it would rather read a book didnt like it at all,didnt like it at all
1.0,i have a kindle paperwhite and do not recommend it to anyone i struggle to transfer by books from the computer to the kindle and there is no support what so ever i follow exactly what the say on the help tab but it does not work the way they sayextremely frustrating will not recommend kindle or ever buy one again,i have a kindle paperwhite and do not recommend it to anyone
4.0,loved this ended up breaking and i purchased a replacement but i dont love the new ones as much as this simple one too many options on the new ones for me the simplicity of this no color easy turn pages were fine,this was my favorite
3.0,i purchased the kindle 7th generation after the screen on my 3rd generation failed i was an avid reader on my kindle 3rd generation and was quite disappointed when the screen broke knowing how much i enjoyed reading on my kindle i decided i couldnt go back to regular paper books so i got the 7th generation is the other day and to be honest was disappointed to see many of the features are gone if you are looking for a straight up ereader with no bells and whistles this will work for youalthough im sure there are cheaper versions or ereaders out there features they have taken aways are the speakers the kindle will no longer read a book to you which i used to us in the car daily also there are no games which the 3rd generation allowed you to download there is no screen contrast it doesnt even come with a wall charger touch screen keyboard is nice miss the buttons on the side to turn the pages thoughguess i have to get used to it it seems to be a stripped down bare bones version of past kindlesthings that have improves screen resolution is greatly improved goodreads is available can download easy from the cloud can see pics of the book covers,not as good as past kindle 3rd generationkeyboard
4.0,ill start by saying i really love the kindle eink display and wouldnt use any other computer screen or reader i dont even miss the side buttons though i did like those on the previous version my overall complaint is that this model seems much cheaper the last generation nontouch screen that i had was a joy to hold in my hand it fit perfectly and i think the back was rubberized for a better grip and to not slide around on stuff it was just wonderful to hold the back plastic on this model is very cheap and slick and while i enjoy the kindle experience overall i dont get the joy out of holding this device like i did the previous model that being said this version is much easier to use for highlighting and making notes which is a feature i like and use frequently,wonderful product but not as nice to hold as the last model
1.0,sucks i knew it had no light i did not know it was unreadable in the light the background is not white my 60 year old eyes cannot see the text,i did not know it was unreadable in the light
1.0,my one star review is solely based on amazons decision to include special offers on their lower priced kindle touch which is still actually not super cheap typically running you about 80 my husband purchased the kindle touch for me from a retailer and so it automatically included what amazon refers to as special offers that amazon claims only kindle users are privy to at first the special offers were limited to amazon products only amazon fire tv stick chargers cases etc and although i was pretty disappointed to learn that my screenlock pages consisted of basically a rotation of amazon ads it was somewhat tolerable although i should note that these special offers were not special at all as the price of each item displayed was actually the same exact price if not cheaper on amazons main website which everyone has access to occasionally amazon would throw a few book cover illustrations in the rotation which was a nicer display although it still displayed the price of the book so was technically an ad as far as im concernedthen it took a turn for the worst a few weeks later my kindle updated automatically and with the update the ads became completely out of control it was no longer limited to amazon products but instead included ads from asics shoes quaker oatmeal vitamin pills icecream life alert bracelets and even blood pressure monitoring devices and it was every single time my kindle was in screenlock mode the one book cover illustration that i did find in this new rotation even had an ad for the land rover in the bottom corner when i unlocked my kindle and went to the homepage the same annoying ads were displayed in a banner at the bottom of the screen had i been able to return my kindle i would have the retailer we purchased it from has a 14 day return policy instead i took the route that i know amazon hopes each person that buys the discounted kindles will take i bought my way out of them for an additional 20 and no you cannot use an amazon gift card to pay for the ads to be removed from your kindle as an amazon customer service person formally informed me fortunately my kindle was purchased at a black friday special price saving us about 30 total and making this 20 adremoval fee a little easier to swallowthat being said as soon as i paid the fee the ads immediately disappeared from my kindle touch and i am much happier with it however i am completely appalled and disappointed with amazon for taking on such shady business practices and making an ereader that has all of visual appeal of a lame adsupported free phone app,not super cheap typically running you about 80
1.0,having problems ordered books but the books i got are not the ones i want,one star
5.0,i am a long time kindle user who has owned several of the models and bought several others for my family members as gifts i think this little kindle is amazing i owned one of the first generation models when they first came out and i loved it and used it for 3 years until i was ready to upgrade to the kindle fire i was excited about the kindle fire and how it was like a tablet but quickly realized i didnt like the tablet part of it or the glass screen with the glare all the time plus it was really hard to type on the keyboard and on all 3 models of the fire the charging port wore out that just happened to me again and this time i saw this model on sale for black friday for 49 and decided i had nothing to lose trying it out it arrived the next day thanks amazon amazing customer service and was very easy to set up it comes with only a charging cord with usb plug now and does not come with the power unit that you need to be able to plug it into an outlet all of my other kindles it was included but now it is sold separately once i got it charged and turned on it only took a couple minutes to set it up and i was reading note this kindle is not backlit it has no light at all so you do need a light to read in the dark i love this kindle it is much lighter than the other models and the touch screen is really nice you dont have to push a button to turn the page if you are an avid reader like me who uses their kindle mainly for reading this is a great device,my favorite kindle yet
1.0,unable to adjust contrast and the background is just too dark unreadable,disappointed
4.0,ill be honest i miss my kindle keyboard i miss having a manual page turn i miss the size and shape and i miss having the music option the new kindle touch is lighter the screen is the same size as the original kindle so it is slightly smaller lengthwise but slightly thicker the screen itself is definitely better it is whiter and reminds me less of an etchasketch it operates faster there is no delay in page turns it turns on the same way as an iphone where you push a button and then have to swipe the screen just right obviously it doesnt have a light but i dont want a backlit reading experienceas to kindle in general over books i love having a kindle and never want to go back it reads better than a book because i can adjust the text size i dont have to deal with the ink rubbing off like with mass market paperbacks or having stiff binding or accidentally ripping a page or getting water on it its not waterproof but a couple drops here or there are fine as long as they dont get inside the housing i dont have to worry about storing the books i want to reread and having to box them up whenever i move i dont have to worry about packing enough books for a vacation and the amount of space they will take up in my suitcase lending books is an issue there is some way of lending books electronically but normally the ones i actually want to lend dont have that option browsing for books is also more frustrating going to a bookstore i can at least verify that an editor has corrected the book for grammar proofreading and quality where as in the kindle store that is never guaranteed and you cant always tell from the price,i miss having physical buttons but the screen is better
1.0,i expected it to have a back light so i could read it at night without additional lighting i was disappointed that it didnt have back lighting,i was disappointed that it didnt have back lighting
5.0,i did get the kindle with special offers they honestly do not bother me at all you dont see anything while reading only the screen saver and im not upset about it recommending a book or something i might enjoy ive only charged it once since i got it used it straight out of the box i never thought i would be an ereader owner but here i am,special offers are nbd
3.0,wish it had a brightness selection…sometimes i like to read in the dark,three stars
5.0,bought as a present for my younger brother he absolutely loves it kindle is great and doesnt provide the exposure to blue light that tablets and smartphones do so its great for before bed reading highly recommend the kindle as a great ereader,kindle is great and doesnt provide the exposure to blue light that 
3.0,all super locked by amazon feel like i borrowed it from them actually,three stars
1.0,terrible the pages turn with the slightest touch and then it is difficult to go back and find where you were it is difficult to bring up the top menu and previous book listings you dont know how far in the book you are i loved the original kindle with the forward and back pages along with the keyboard you could also play games with the original they really need to devise the original style with the paper white light up version that i would buy 10 times over,terrible the pages turn with the slightest touch and 
3.0,bought for my dad who is oldfashioned and hasnt even touched it yet,three stars
5.0,my son took over my kindle 2nd generation so i treated myself to a new kindle i love the touch screen its easy to use and light enough to carry in my purse i have an ipad and a smart phone but i prefer reading on my kindle its nice that i can read in sunshine on the kindle where i cant on my other two devices,lightweight easy to see in sunlight
5.0,love my new kindle it was delivered to my door in less than 24 hours,five stars
4.0,i now have two kindles and was going to give my old one to my wife to use then found out she cannot get prime benefits on a new account for her without paying for another hundred dollar prime account i thought that both of us were included on our one accountshe hasnt used it in the month weve had it so i transferred the book i am reading over to it and may sell one of them likely this one as my other kindle is a button activated one and it seems to read better to meif you are a first time kindle buyer this is a great reader if you are upgrading from the mechanical button basic kindle my advice is to keep your old one or skip this one and get the paperwhite with backlight i havent tied that one yet but the backlight and advertised better readability might be worth iti dont know why but i prefer my old one we do have three windows 81 tablets two 116 ones and one 108 venue 11 pro with full hd and ips screen so we dont need internet on our readers and no i do not like the larger tablets for reading with the outdoor light washing them out in sunlightso i give this one four stars as a standalone and one off for not really giving me anything more than my first one which i switched back to i would take another star off for the prime not being a real family membership where my wife can have her own account and get the same deals on her books etc we both watch the streaming on our fire tv and like it this prime thing is like saying that she should not watch too as she does not pay a separate hundred bucks for a prime account of her ownof all the transactions ive had with amazon over the years this one seemed completely out of character sure we can pretend they are the same person on them and just load her books on one and my books on the other but why you guys should allow a family plan which all come from the same ip address or router easy enough to check maybe limit it to four before we have to lie about it,great for a first device
1.0,the screen is easy to hv sratch if u dun use any case for protection,one star
3.0,didnt expect it to be so hard on my eyes would prefer a backlight,three stars
4.0,i like the first one better this is a little too wide to fit comfortably in your palm as the other did its way heavier the screen is not as bright in dark rooms the touch menu is at the top instead of the bottom and everythings now by touch so its easy to accidentally send yourself somewhere you dont want to go you can now swipe to turn pages though i didnt mind squeezing a button on the side to turn a page since it the old one fit comfortably in my hand i still give it 4 stars because kindle readers are great products,great product but i liked the old model better
2.0,i am very disappointed in amazons warranty regarding the kindle my daughter received some ebooks for christmas and they would not download to her device i researched the problem and amazons website indicated we should reboot the device it has been in a frozen state ever since we tried that i called the support line and they tried doing the same things i did and nothing worked the device is 33 days past the warranty and they will do nothing for us we get to buy a new one if we want to replace it i said no thanks very disappointing customer service,i am very disappointed in amazons warranty regarding the kindle
2.0,i didnot order this i was at a christning all day out of town take this off now,two stars
4.0,i have a hard time getting used to the touch screen the previous 5th gen kindle had a more positive feel for the control buttons after a week am still unable to to find a way to delete books from the kindle where is the menu button i bought the kindle for reading books not for all the built in fancy tricks,amazon has abandoned the kiss principle
3.0,i felt that i would get more light from it al in all i am enjoying this kindle,three stars
4.0,i really like this for reading out in the sun but wish it had a brighter light at times also wish the letters were a little more sharp at best buy they didnt have any on display so was sort of left to guessing what differences it might have compared to the next model uplove the size and have figured out how easy it is to down load and transfer books from old tablet,i really like this for reading out in the sun
2.0,i was some what disappointed that the screen was not bright enough i was used to the kindle fire and i assumed that the screen on the kindle was as bright,i was some what disappointed that the screen was not bright enough
5.0,please make sure to read the product description many of the low ratings seem to spawn from not knowing what this is it is an ereader simply put there are no bells or whistles it is for reading ebooks in the same way one would read a paper book it is glarefree and easy on the eyes my otherwise techdeficient betterhalf figured it out on the first try it is simple yet effective and very useful,make sure you know what youre buying
2.0,i must have ordered the wrong cover it does not fitthe cover wont close,wrong case
5.0,this review is for the 7th generation kindle 6 first of all let me start by saying it is very important to know what you want to do with your kindle before purchasing one know what you are buying this is a very basic kindlewhat it is not it does not come with a light it does not use 3g or 4g and does not have the capability it does not allow a user to browse the internet it does not allow a used to play games it does not show colorwhat it is it is very lightweight it uses wifi to download books it uses eink to display titles words etc it has a touch screen that is very clearly laid out it is very easy to use without all the clutter of apps that comes with kindles that do have internet access it has extra options on the screen such as a dictionary sync to furthest page read note pages etc it has a long battery lifelet me explain why my nots do not matter to me i never read in a dimly lit area or in the dark so i did not care about having a light although if allowed to pick one feature to change i would probably ask for a light however i do not find it necessary to have one with this product a person must have wifi access to download books which is fine for me since i have wifi at home i download all my books at home so that i will have plenty to read before leaving on a trip if you want to download books anytimeanywhere this is not the product for you if you are wanting to play music games tune in to social media surf the internet etc this is not the right kindle for you i use my laptop and smartphone for all the above but did not want this on my kindlenow let me tell you why i love this kindle this is so lightweight that i feel like i am almost holding nothing even after i put it in a case i love the fact that it uses eink instead of a backlit screen because my eyes are sometimes a bit sensitive and eyes grow tired if using my daughters kindle fire to read with the eink i can read for a longer time i really like the touch screen and do not understand the negative comments about not having page turners the page can either be swiped to the side to change or the bottom righthand corner can be tapped to change to the next page when the top is tapped a menu to go to the home screen amazon shopping cart search bar font and extra options is displayed which is so easy to use i do enjoy the extra options menu because it has just enough extra features without being too many like the clutter of apps i mentioned in the above section please understand i enjoy using apps and like them on my smartphone just not my kindleif you are wanting a kindle that will do everything a computer or tablet will do then i recommend purchasing another type of kindle to meet all your needs but if you are just wanting to read books electronically without other stuff to get you sidetracked then this quite possibly could be the kindle for youi love reading books and having the ability to finish a book then download another one immediately as well as storing my previously read books i also really like being able to look up the meaning of words found in my book from a dictionary right at my fingertips and never stop reading my kindle is reserved for reading pure and simple and i am loving using ithope this helps ,wonderful product if you know what you are buying
1.0,eh,not so great
4.0,i only gave 4 stars because it is about meeting expectations i was thinking i could read crochet books and such on the kindle but it really isnt great for detailed drawings it isnt a fault of the kindle just something i hadnt thought to consider it is only a 6 screen so there is only so much space available i do enjoy reading books on it and that is really what i bought it for it is comfortable to hold more comfortable than an actual book especially when my kitty is sitting on my lap it is also better than an actual book in that you can adjust the font size that comes in handy in a lowlight situation i like that i can borrow books at my local library for the kindle without even going there there is also a large selection of free and public domain titles to download without charge on amazon i will finally read a lot of the classics i missed the battery seems to last a long time i only recharged it so far because i plugged it in to check on books to download i just wish it came with a good protective cover i will have to buy one or make one i am a little afraid to take it with me anywhere without one,great entrylevel ereader
2.0,does not have back lighting a feature that almost all devices like it have, back lighting a feature that almost all devices like it have
4.0,this kindle allowed me to get back my paperwhite after daughter made off with it to read heroes of olympus series books with my kindle the next volume was readily available so she could keep going without signing up for the waiting list at her library or making a trip to the bookstorethis model is inexpensive and sturdy enough to be appropriate for an older elementary age kid im not following her around taking it away from her while she tries to keep reading through eating and brushing her teeththe price point allowed a family member to give this as a holiday gift allowing me to receive my paperwhite back again for a second holiday season in a row everyone is happy now daughter is really not interested in the device in any way only the books on it i suggest setting up an account for the recipient setting up the device and loading them up with books you know they want ahead of time unless they are fully comfortable doing this on their own we did this and carefully returned the kindle to the original box its really nice for the recipient to turn it on and go growing comfortable with the kindle as they use itthe limitations are that this model isnt for reading in the dark probably just as well and doesnt seem to have the family sharing feature although you can share if the other kindle involved does allow that the sharing is fairly confusing still they have work to do there but its ok the case parts and form factor are not as nice as more expensive models but this is a reasonable trade off for the pricehate the facebook good reads feature built in dear amazon please remove that as part of your os and make it an optional feature for those who want it super annoying bloatware not interested i recommend keeping junk from other businesses off your clean and simple device yuck,good buy especially for kids
1.0,it does not have the ability to read without other lighting as the last did,one star
5.0,this is my first time owning a kindle ereader when it first arrived i was surprised at how high quality the screen was it reads like an actual book and is very light i love the new xray feature which gives descriptions and background information on each of the characters in a book its the perfect size i hear people saying that the plastic on the back feels cheap but its fine to me and has a nice touchthe only thing i dont like is how easily the kindle can get scratched around the the kindle logo this amazing for anyone who loves to read but doesnt want to carry a lot of heavy books around,amazing device for reading
1.0,did not like it no back light returned it very disappointed in amazon,one star
4.0,i like many of the new features the go to section for example but at this point in some ways im finding it harder to use than my old kindle admittedly i prefer printed using real books so im not getting as much experience as i could the features may be there but theyre harder to find for example i could see a list of all the kindle books i had bought but not yet read this doesnt include the archived books its undoubtedly there but i havent found it yet i have a list on paper when youre reading a whole list of features with instructions its hard to remember all the information so right now i miss my old familiar kindle which lost,lots of good things and some bad
2.0,lasted about one and onehalf years before dying that is not long enough,come on im tired of endlessly replacing things that should have been made better
3.0,i was surprised and disappointed to find out that the kindle is not backlit,not quite what i expected
1.0,after two attempts to find a case that fits we just sent it back this is an odd unit,cant find case that fits
1.0,this is not bright as i thought it would be plus the functions are not user friendly,one star
5.0,i just love this it doesnt take up much room and holds a charge for days on a recent flight i just stuck this in my purse and then reached right in when i got ready to read no fumbling around in a carry on the glarefree screen was great too since i never had to tilt the device to get rid of glare im very happy with my purchase,very pleased with my purchase
1.0,too complicated for me to understand i need a more easier onei am a beginner,one star
5.0,i like my new kindle very much i have had the kindle keyboard for years now and it was starting to get a little wonky now and then i have to restart it a couple times a month when it freezes i had put this new kindle on my wish list in case i received a price drop notice and jumped on it it is much lighter than the keyboard kindle and that is a big plus also the touch screen is sooo much easier than the keyboard it takes some getting used to for page turning but its not a big deal it is very sensitive to touch but once you get the hang of it i think it is fine i prefer to read on this type of ereader as it is so much easier on my eyes i also have a fire but do not like to read books on it,very nice
2.0,my kindle does not have a backlight why no more electronics purchases from amazon,no backlight
3.0,the good i love being able to have all of my books in one place whenever i want to read them so this kindle is perfect for me the text of the books actually makes this kindle look like actual pages in a book books download fast and are easily accessiblei would recommend getting kindle unlimited for any book loverthe bad the only complaint i have about this kindle is the lighting it is hard to see in dim lighting also when reading the books you can see a fade of the prior page in the backgroundthe bottom line overall this is a good product i would suggest getting the paper white version if possible if you cannot get the paper white i would suggest buying a clip on light if plan on reading it in dim lighting,good kindle but buy the paper white if you can
3.0,no back lighting like the paper white and doesnt fit any of my cases so check size,its ok
5.0,i am old school i honestly think i would not like it i like the feel of paper i love books i now love my kindle i take it everywhere even to the beach i guess you can teach and old dog new tricks i am hooked,you can teach old dog new tricks
1.0,i did not realize it was only 6 and not in colori am very disappointed,i am very disappointed
5.0,a fantastic little ereader no glare no hassles easy to use easy to read what more can you ask for in a simple low cost ereader i do not know i like many of you have an iphone and an ipad and i love them and use them every day but the simple ease of use and easiness on the eyes kindle is more pleasant to read and it is so much like reading a paper back book thank you amazon for this excellent product now i have over 900 books on my little kindle,easy on the eyes
1.0,the kindle came in paper envelop with some bubble wrap which is not a proper package for eletronic items and of course was not working propperly the screen was blinking very disappointed item returned ,not working how should be
5.0,this is my first kindle i found the user interface quite intuitive when i read the reviews so many people said they could not figure it out for the life of me this thing is so simple to use within 15 minutes i had it figured out and 10 books loaded on it one other common complaint were addsthere are two versions of the machine one with adds that is cheaper and one without if you buy the cheaper version you are paying a lower price because of the adds if you dont want adds pay the higher price please indulge me on one final rant this devise does not have a back light that means you need to read it in a lit room or space the advantage of this it that it is easy to read outside in sunlight if you order one without a back light and complain that you cant read it in the darkwhats a matter wit you read the product description that is what they are there for not on with my review it works i can read books on it it is easy to use i can read in the bright sun with it and i cant read it in the dark this is a good simple devise that does its job noughsaid,whats a matter wit you
1.0,no home button no sound not capable of handling previously purchased kindle apps,i returned mine
5.0,in the box the kindle box included the kindle and a usb cord it would be nice if they included a wall adapter but no one does these days sighsizeweight it has a decent size display at 6 and the weight is nice not too heavyfeel i like the feel of the nook simple touch better its has a soft and smooth rubber type backing that is easy to holdthe the kindle is just plastic this is bad it slips through my fingers easily and if i am holding it for a long time my fingers sweat making it more likely i will drop it on my face while laying in bed lol they seriously need to fix thistouch screen works great with a fast response timeadding books with the kindle if you dont purchase the book from amazon you can simply email your book to your kindle email address and its added to your device over wifi what you say yes its that easy man i have been missing outdeleting books you can simply hold and touch the book icon on your kindle until a screen pops up and select remove from device your book is still on your amazon account and you can resend it at anytimebattery life you know this one is hard for me to gauge because i really dont pay attention and i read a lot i started using my kindle on december 4th and have not been notified to charge it yet so that is a plus i have had wifi on the whole time the charge is getting pretty low thoughother the kindles lack of page numbers is really annoying i like having the ability to glance down and seeing how far into a book i am the kindle does not allow this huge bummer the kindle allows you to highlight passages and makes notes its a nice feature to have and i have already used it the kindle has some quirk i have yet to figure out when i drop it on my head while reading yes this does happen often as like i said above its slippery plastic shell is not cool or hits something on accident when i set it down it changes the font size kinda annoying anyone know if i can turn off what ever feature is causing this i purchased mine on black friday for only 49 with ads the ads are perfectly fine on there i am glad i didnt pay more to not have them i,needs a new housing design
2.0,i was very disapointed that it does not have a back light that was the main reason i bought it is there possibly a small readying light that i can click to it,i was very disapointed that it does not have a 
5.0,first and foremost everyone needs to understand that this low cost product does not have a backlight buy the next model up if you think you want that feature i already had a kindle fire hd i specifically got this kindle because i wanted to read at night without having a backlight to mess with serotonin levels which can screw up your sleep cycles it works well and of course works extremely well under daylight conditions and now im sleeping better at night i also like the fact that it doesnt need constant recharging a single charge can last for two weeks of reading or more not a bad little device and easy on the eyes,first and foremost everyone needs to understand that this 
1.0,it doesnt light up as the ad had stated the rebate was denied and i did it on the website so i played 3000 more because of that i would not purchase again,not at all
3.0,i started with one of the keyboard 3g kindles then moved up to a first gen kindle fire i loved both of them the screen on the keyboard one cracked so i had to take the fire around with me its quite heavy and i had been thinking about getting a regular kindle for the train commute so i didnt have to carry the fire around when i saw this one on sale for 49 i took the plungethings i dont like about it the touch screen does seem to be kind of hyper sensitive many times ive touched to change pages and its jumped ahead several pages also the unit just froze a few times within the first few days of use and i had to hold the power button in to get it to shut down and then restart it upon restarting it put me back a few chapters it is hard to see details on the pictures of book covers as you are browsing the picture is not sharp or focused i have taken to buying the books on my laptop and loading them onto it because its useless for browsing i wont send it back because for the most part it serves the purpose for which it was purchased glitches aside however i would not want to have this as my only device to purchase and read books onthe screen is kind of small smaller than the keyboard one was im counting that as a neutral point because although its annoying to have to change pages more often it does contribute to the overall compactness of this ereader the screen is also dull which i dont consider a bad thing but you might i find the lack of back lighting easy on my eyes however you cant read it in dim lightingthings i like about it its very light probably a quarter of the weight of my fire it also starts up instantly there arent a lot of bells and whistles which i like i bought it so i could read books on the train and it covers that without a bunch of other stuff that could go wrong with it i like the ability to adjust the font size you can do this on all kindlesoverall im satisfied with it for the price i would be less happy if i had paid the full price for it for under 50 it was worth it,worth buying if you can get it on sale
5.0,since the first kindle came out ive wanted one but never had the ability to get myself one and no one ever gifted me one so when i found this deal i jumped at it and i couldnt be happier with my purchase its the only way anyone should read ebooks i have a tablet with the kindle app on it but i always had a hard time reading anything on it because if i was under a light the screen would glare and if i was outside it was impossible to see anything on my tablet at all this makes the reading experience of ebooks so much more enjoyable and i love all the graphic screen saver things that appear when i turn my kindle off,luv luv luv it 3
2.0,i guess i was expecting it to be in color and not just black and white a bit disappointed,a bit disappointed
4.0,only problem i had with it was 2 days after i ordered mine amazon dropped the pricetag 20,four stars
4.0,this is my 4th kindle and my least favorite it looks and feels cheap however for the price i wasnt expecting a lot thus 4 stars if you expect it to perform like it only cost 79 youll be happy if you buy this version expecting the touch screen to perform like your cell phone or tablet youll be disappointed i found that tapping the screen works better than swiping to turn the page if i used my kindle daily i would want a nicer version for reading a couple of days a week this is a great dealpros it is cheap i bought it on sale for 59 it is small and light so it fits easily in my purse i like the touch screen well enough it is fairly responsive for such an inexpensive electronic device it is comfortable to hold while reading a little easier than my kindle keyboard because it is lighter and there arent any buttons to accidentally press while reading the screen is fairly responsive when highlighting a word to look up in the dictionarycons this kindle does not have holes in the side to pop in to a cover i like that feature in my previous kindle keyboard i havent purchased the cover that is made for it so i cant speak to how well it is designed there are no page turn buttons some people might not care some may i thought the screen images would be sharper based on the product description book covers and books with pictures are decent but not as crisp as my kindle keyboardoverall id recommend this version to someone looking for a cheap casual use ereader if you are a heavy user or picky about the performance of your electronics id upgrade to a different version,good for a cheap ereader
1.0,this item did not meet my expectations and i returned it the day after receiving it sorry,one star
5.0,bought this for my mother shes older and isnt the biggest fan of electronics a let alone touchscreen devices but she loves this one thing to be aware of however is that comes preloaded with the account from which its ordered if its being given as a gift youll want to make sure to correct this,bought this for my mother shes older and isnt 
1.0,i did not receive any instruction on how to use it i have yet to get any text to read help,i did not receive any instruction on how to use 
4.0,i have to say i like this thing but it would be better so much so with more settings and an ability to turn off the ads that display themselves on itnamely itd be nice to put some books behind a password to set a cover image for the kindle itself when idle and to import fonts at this point it is and will seem to stay something i got for what it was worth when it was on sale earlier this year 2015i mean its nice as far as using it though it can be frustrating for someone with big hands and flattipped fingers namely most commands seem to be set up for either a device 15 times the size or for manipulation using only the nail of your finger if thats even possible buttons dont seem to follow the basic logic of finger size in any way text links in the browser for instance have no isolation from eachother poke one and you may just poke the one near it or above even below or perhaps youll zoom out instead i mean again im glad i got it for what i did glad i have it yeah but not as glad as i could be,worth getting on sale like really on sale
3.0,i am not tack savoy it is taking me more time to get organized than i planned on not your products problemits the user i will attempt to go on line and use the video as hep,i am not tack savoy it is taking me 
5.0,amazing artifact you should know that pdfs can be read with this as well,five stars
5.0,i thought this was a very good device but it is not for me ipad and iphone are enough,five stars
4.0,my first kindle was the kindle keyboard so my review is in comparison to that i didnt update until now due to device storage the other kindles between keyboard and this one were half the storage so no way was i going to do a backwards step overall i really do like this kindle it is easy to use i love the anti glare and how the pages look like that of a real book in that off white colourthere are only 2 points in which i dont like about this kindle1 collections names with number of items in them take up 2 lines instead of 1 resulting in less number of collections showing on the one screen there is plenty of room for the name of the collection and for the number of items in each collection to be side by side by doing this more collections could be listed per screenpage in this instance i prefer the following fiction 10 or fiction 10 the word items after the number is totally optional2 when viewing all collections are no longer at the top with all books listed below them even then with the keyboard the only items showing after the collections were those not place in a collection now whether they are in a collection or not all are showing in this instance i prefer the way it was with my kindle keyboard collections at the top everything else underneath them and any added to collections not show up in the all listing the reason for this is because i would only place them into a collection after i had read them if they werent in a collection then i had not read them it just made it so much easier to work out what i had and hadnt read now i am wasting time by having to check on goodreads as to whether ive read the book or notother than those two points i am happy with this device,good but
1.0,i am unhappy because it would be as easy to read as my paprewhite and it definitely is not my paperwhite was damaged by water so i ordered this by mistake and i am very unhappy,my mistake i thought it would be like paperwhite
5.0,i love my new kindle it is light and easy to read i love my kindle fire also but wanted a lighter one that is glarefree to use outside so this one will work perfectly for that it is also great that when you have two kindles you can pick up either one to read your book because the books are in the cloud,great kindle for keeping in my purse
2.0,not what i expected at all started to return it but decided it was not worth the trouble,two stars
5.0,excellent this is my first reading kindle and i am not disappointed works exactly as described i have had this for six days and have used about 50 of battery i have been turning on wifi for a few minutes a couple times a day i have also been reading for one to two hours a day happy with battery life,love it
1.0,i have to replace my kindle it got broken however this is just garbage returning it,do not buy
2.0,i never write reviews and feel bad for rating so low but two things are preventing me from loving it1 i loved loved loved the text to speech option i would listen to books throughout the day and i even thought it was helping me improve the speed at which i read when my kindle died i never thought that the new generation kindles wouldnt have that feature when i didnt see it on the list i assumed wrongly that it was still there someone said in a forum make sure you choose the kindle thats right for you i wouldnt have chosen any of the new generation kindles since none of them have this feature i def would have just went with a kindle fire assuming that the option is still there2 i used to be able to search for and download books anywhere without needing to find a new network now i find that im stuck with what i have already downloaded which is frustrating i dont always know that im going to need to download before i leave homeits new to me and i want to love it maybe ill feel differently in a matter of months,color me disappointed
1.0,help the screen is to dark for me to read and i cant find a way to make it lighter,dark screen
1.0,i purchased this for my husband for christmas hoping the glarefree screen would be good for him ha this model has been a huge mistake he does not do well with touchscreens as he goes to sleep reading and touches the screen then kindle changes pages on him so he spends a lot of his reading time trying to find where he was in a book sometimes its not even the book that is currently showing on the screen the screen is too easy to change and irritatingly pops up font changes and other garbage the older models with the side buttons were perfect easy to use i have a side button model myself and dread the day when mine decides to quit since i cant buy another one on amazon i think ill check out ebay for the old style gee amazon good job running off people ps their customer service folks in india have poor english its hopeless too dont bother,a big disappointment from amazon
5.0,i have an ipad 2 but it is heavy for carrying when i travel because i also take along my laptop this stays in my purse at all times because of its compact size so my books are everywhere i am i did not mind not having the light as i dont read in the dark often but unlike my ipad i can read in the sun with this beauty,better for reading than ipads
5.0,this is my first kindle i deliberately waited before writing a review im not sure that this model is still available but the model type features are similar throughout the product line i thought i might dislike the transition away from paper books but its been very smooth i will always have a reverence for real books but you simply cant beat the convenience of being able to bring books into your home without having to leave home,new tricks for an old dog
5.0,it took me forever to order this because i was overwhelmed by all the choices of kindles to choose from i have a 4th generation basic kindle for years and love it when i saw the new one on sale i decided to upgrade but couldnt decide which one fit my needs the best paperwhite basic hire i really wanted a kindle keyboard but the dont sell them anymore i only wanted that one because of the audio reading feature which i could use while folding laundry or taking a bath etc the fire was out because i only want to read on my kindle i read in bed every night so the paperwhite was tempting due to the built in lights however the sale price of the basic kindle was too good to pass up for what i would have paid for the paperwhite i got a new touchscreen kindle pretty leather case and a clipon kindle light i am happy as a pig in mud the best feature is that the kindle automatically turns off when i close the case and on when i open it saves battery life also it saves the words you look up to a special vocabulary builder on your kindle so you can review them and learn the words you didnt previously know i passed my old kindle on to my daughter who loves it im extremely happy with this one also i joined kindle unlimited and can get up to 10 books at a time with no due date they have a great selection so for under 10month its a great deal,love my kindle
4.0,so far so good it is as described no back light but the screen looks like a real book which is amazing for technology ive never had a kindle before but so far im loving it but one suggestion before buying this read the page so you wont be like others complaining about what it is missing when it says it doesnt have it,so far so good it is as described
4.0,this product has not been delivered to my house i checked and no one has seen this package at all,this product has not been delivered to my house i 
3.0,page turns slowly compared to other ebook devices and my ipad it really interferes with the flow of reading and can be very annoying the device is very slow on processing and it took a very long time for the covers of my downloaded books to show up on the screen im thinking about returning the device or selling it to someone who wants it its just too dang slow,slowww
2.0,im enjoying the kindle 6 glarefree touchscreen but i wasnt aware of any special offers,two stars
5.0,i love being able to read a whole library on a small device that doesnt use a backlight i travel a lot so this is much more convenient for me i actually prefer reading on a kindle rather than an actual book unless i want to annotate the book because i dont have to hold the kindle open like i have to hold the pages of a book open i can just prop the device up against something while im reading and poke it when i want to turn the page i do have to say that the glarefree description isnt accurate i would say glareresistant is a better description,library on a small device
1.0,i had a voyage touchscreen and returned it i have parkinsons and the touchscreen is much too sensitive the fonts available were not heavy enoughand not as good as my button kindle ereader,did not like touchscreen voyage
3.0,i liked the older model better if you pick up this kindle or touch a word by mistake it changes pages or activates other features i like to sometimes mark my place for a moment with my finger or follow the print with my finger this will not work with this model i understand progress but to eliminate the older non touch screen completely was a mistake on the part of kindle,dont love the touch screen
1.0,i do not like this kindle and will be returning it the screen brightness cannot be adjusted,cannot adjust brightness on this kindle
4.0,i have now had three kindles the first one unfortunately had problems before i used it amazon replaced it immediately and i grew quite fond of it i was very comfortable with software system butalas the second one died totally unexpected it wasnt a dead battery it just simply would not turn on and its light was dead so i ordered a new one the operating software has been upgraded and im not all that pleased with the os it used to be that i could call on the dictionaries at any time and look up a word from any other book the new third kindle does not allow me to do that other than that all else is okay it is some what lighter than the metal cased ones and sometimes the screen freezes up on it and it takes several swipes to get it to respond to a simple page turn so the os system is why i gave it a four star rating,i was very comfortable with software system
1.0,this works well and my granddaughter loves it however i have a kindle fire from when they were first released that has never worked correctly for nother granddaughter how can i get hellp,this works well and my granddaughter loves it however 
5.0,this is a lightweight kindle that is really lightweight i have purchased kindles and love the screen because i can read outside without glare which i didnt find in the fire this is fantastic for people who love to read on the go and can read anywhere i carry it in my bag with me everywhere,i have purchased kindles and love the screen because i can read outside without glare 
3.0,just okayit takes some getting used to lots of things are different from my older kindle,just okay
4.0,i thought my first kindle was broke so i purchased another one and after i received it my first one started working again so i go back and forth between them i love using my kindles i dont think i will ever go back to real books if you love to read like i do you cant go wrong with a kindle ereader,kindle glarefree
1.0,with out a back light feature you must be in a well lit area to read it i will be retuning it,hard to read
5.0,the kindle is great for avid readers who also advocate reduction of materialuse and ultimately forest conservation one can have numerous books in a single ebook tablet not only does it save physical storage space the kindle also does a great job in providing a visual interface which is similar to reading a hardcopy book,a great and affordable product for avid readers
3.0,every time you login into your kindle you will have to see an add unless you buy the no special offers version or pay 15 afterward i bought this item from best buy who is at fault for not advertising it better however this is an amazon product and they are equally bad at advertising the difference on this pagethe product itself is beautiful and the sound quality is amazing th processor can be a bit sluggish going from one app to another and loading web pages streams netflix like a champ though,note the difference between the special and nonspecial offers
1.0,returning this promptly impossible to figure out been trying to get a book my daughter is actually interested in for over a hour waste of time when you can borrow ebooks from the library,dont buy this
1.0,you need exterior lighting to read this kindle so you cant read if others want the lights out ect wish i had the kindle that was stolen from me i could read that anytime day or night,you need exterior lighting to read this kindle so you 
1.0,when i first received this new reader i was so pleased with it until i started to actually use it daily my god what did kindle do to this reader this is my third kindle reader and i have to say the worse i am so dizzy going back and forth every time i open it to read to change the font size every two minutes also do not even think of sneezing when you are reading it will turn about five pages with the wind another complaint i have is finding previous books i purchased my last kindle was so very easy to navigate this one is a horror so i am sending my second review for this kindle to inform everyone who is thinking of purchasing this reader beware and pay attention to all the negative reviews they are right on the money,horrible what were you thinking kindle
5.0,works perfectly great size like reading a pocket paperback except thinner absolutely no need for backlighting as the screen is perfect the only slightly negative is the slick finish and thats probably not a problem for anyone that doesnt have very dry skin im solving that with a cheap cover that will also protect the screen while traveling tons of free books on amazon that let me get started before making more expensive purchases thanks,glarefree kindle
5.0,i love my kindle i can enjoy all the books i want in one place without having to lug around many different heavy books while i do prefer hard back books the convenience of the kindle works with my on the go life d,i love my kindle
4.0,you alls tracking is off thanks ive recieved it already in my case my orders has been very misleading,four stars
5.0,this kindle is great for the price point it truly feels like you are reading a real book the font and look of the screens feels like a paperback the type has a nice contrast with the background i would highly recommend this for long time physical book readers because it is an easy transition this does not have the bright glare of phones and tablets you will love the ease of carrying around thousands of books in your pocket without ever accidently losing your place i am an avid reader and for many years i resisted mightly against going over to the dark side of ebooks but i got a special offer for this and i decided to buy it and give kindle another try i had bought a kindle about 2 years back and it felt cheap and like an old piece of tech this kindle is much diiferent it really has the look and feel of a real book i joined kindle unlimited and now i read a book a day i can read at my lunch break and relacing in bed i love this kindle the only con is no built in night light,awesome entry level kindle
3.0,not really what i wanted i would have preferred the key board kindle this one is too small a screen,not really what i wanted i would have preferred 
3.0,wanted a kindle i could read in the sun and one which would have a much longer battery life than my 2 fires this fits the bill its not so easy to use however quite cumbersome to pull books newly purchased on fire from cloud to nonglare kindle then once downloaded on nonglare kindle the book vanishes into the vast library of books read in past and one has to painstakingly search through the books to find new book usually around 200th in the queue its light and portable and once the nook is up i enjoy the reading experience,serves the purpose not user friendly
1.0,was not good did have all the necessary items on it there was no way to change the brightness level,dissatisfied
5.0,ive had my kindle for a few days now since the release date so 5 days total and so far i absolutely love it i was skeptical of the touchscreen but i find that i actually like it much more than the previous kindle it has a swipetoopen feature to unlock the device in addition to the button on the bottom of the deviceits not bad but i feel its a bit redundant when theres a button to unlock the device as well it also has parental controls which is a nice touch for those who have kids that like to go purchasing things with 1click the setup is just like the previous generation kindle paperwhite which is very clean and well organized in my personal opinionthe casing feels a bit cheap it doesnt have the smooth back like the previous generation kindle did which i was a fan of other than the casing i love the device and would recommend it to anyone looking into an ereader i would suggest a clipon light to go along with it if youre one who likes to read in bed but dont want to spend the extra money for a builtin light,much improved
1.0,returned kindle that included case with the priceonly received refund for kindle and not case,incorrect refund amount
5.0,i bought two of these sight unseen for my wife and me because i happened to catch a great sale i think it was a good move the basic kindle seems to be all we would ever needless than a year ago i downloaded a free kindle cloud reader to my chromebook and really enjoyed using it but there are times when reading on a relatively heavy laptop is inconvenient and can also be distracting since i usually have one eye on my email i was also trying to share a limited time frame free library ebook with my wife so i got thinking that maybe having a kindle might be more convenient more portablelong story shorter at the sale price i decided to buy two one for each of us they arrived yesterday with still a week left on that library book we have only had them for 24 hours and are already nuts about em easy to use light weight uberportable individually customizable i have already established that we can be simultaneously reading the same book on two different kindles on two different pages with different fonts and font sizes no problem the touch screen is very convenient and fairly intuitive and in any case the full instruction manual is right on board and can be referred to at any time i have an idea that the spendier paperwhite is cooler but the lack of a backlight and a faintly gray screen isnt bothering us in the least and real books dont have backlights on the other hand real books dont have wifi but kindles do i am writing this review before i have even scratched the surface of what the basic kindle can do i am really impressed i may one day decide i have to upgrade but at the moment i cant conceive of a reason,basic kindle is a terrific value
2.0,i like reading on the kindle but i want to be able to read in the dark but this item has no light,i like reading on the kindle
5.0,ive had this a few weeks now only had charge it once so far the batterylasts the kindle unlimited is just fantastic free for the first 30 days and im hooked now so many selections my nook had kicked the bucket after about 5 years or so and im so glad i switched to kindle i do so much on amazon and the points add up on the credit card which can helped pay for this kindle device my son can use it and read anytime he wants although hes not really a big reader there are enough selections of books on minecraft that hes actually reading without me having to pester him to do so the device itself handles well i like the cover that was in the bundle and its fairly easy to maneuver in its much faster thank my nook was as well which kept dropping the wireless but this kindle does not have that issue,good change from nook
4.0,had a problem working out which model it is that i bought landed up buying a cover that didnt fit ,had a problem working out which model it is that 
3.0,the touch screen has problems some of the features do not work or only work part of the time as in not often mine wont go back into airplane mode at all which would save the battery running down so quickly turning the pages forward or backward too often jumps many pages ahead or drops back many pages making continuous reading a chore you end up spending as much time hunting for where you actually left off as you do reading on a lot of occasions when the earlier kindle took you right back to where you left off every time im told this is a known problem by a friend who is technically knowledgeable certainly maddening all in all this version of the kindle works far more poorly than my earlier kindle i think amazon tried to do too much with it essentially got carried away with hoping readers would be able to have a magic touch that is needed for its various but erratic features next time im considering buying a tablet and downloading the app in the hope it might work better,touchscreen schizophrenia
2.0,this was supposed to be back lit and it not we will be calling for a return feel we were misled,this was supposed to be back lit and it not 
3.0,i bought this because my other kindle died i loved the original kindle it was the one with the keyboard at the bottom this one does not fit as well in the hand and is awkward to hold for me causing some wrist pain i would have bought one of the old ones but a refurbished was 3 time more expensive,i loved the original kindle
1.0,too small void of easy to aquire and understand instructions favorite word game was not available,newer not better
3.0,i owned a kindle but the screen got damaged for no reason i contacted amazon and they told me that it happens some times anyway i loved my kindle so i wanted a new one the person i talked with persuaded me to buy this version as it was with a great 20 discount this was no more than two weeks ago and now i check the deals and the kindle price dropped another 10 not sure if amazon can do anything about this but surely is not nice to pay a higher price for the same item not even a month ago,price dropped significantly since i bought it
1.0,i purchased this device for reading at night since there is no light i cant read it after dark i,kindle 6 glare ire touchscreen display
1.0,i ordered 7 inch from ondline ad you sent 6 inch no back light a real disappointment how do i send it back,no back light a real disappointment how do i send it back
3.0,ok i bought it to replace my old kindle that i lost and it is so different i never figured out how to use it,need help
5.0,i like it much better than my first generation kindle the size is perfect not too big not too small i like the touch screen its light weight and the flash when the page changes is much shorter than the first gen,love my kindle
2.0,i find i do not have enough info to understand how to use it i sure like like my old kindle much better,i sure like like my old kindle much better
1.0,these kindles are garbage this is the second one ive owned and has died and is now worthless the warranty is only one year for a reasonit will die literally right after the one year mark shame on you amazon for making such garbage,piece of garbage not built to last
2.0,i for one was very disappointed in the kindle i purchased first of all i am still not able to convert the text to english us also i would like to return it but im not sure because i could not find clear instructions from messages,i for one was very disappointed in the kindle i purchased
3.0,the kindle works okay but perhaps its glarefree feature also works against it as i found the display to be very dark in a lowlight setting the screen was difficult to readthe unit has much lower resolution which makes the reading a bit roughthe next model up has backlight and higher resolution and both features are compelling enough to move up the kindle ladderseparately the unit is very compact and can easily be carried almost anywhere it is completely plastic and so not sure how durable it will beit is simple to use and setup was a breezeas others have commented the ads are a nonissue they form the screensaver when the unit is technically off when you logon they go away completelyall in all a nice little reader for basic use,the unit is very compact and can easily be carried almost anywhere
5.0,good,five stars
5.0,we now own four of these at my house two for the older kids and one each for my wife and i replacing our beloved 2nd gen models while part of me misses my keyboard and physical buttons i have to admit that i love the compact design the screen clarity and resolution and the overall experience with this newer kindlei also love the fact that we can control our kids kindles easily and share books with oneanother through kindle family libraryi know some like reading on phones or tablets and others are going back to paper books but in our house the ebook rules and the kindle is standard equipment,reading for the 21st century
3.0,gift,three stars
5.0,i won this kindle in a contest already owning a kindlefirehd although i love the one that i had bought for use in a variety of different applications my won kindle in just incredible for reading true its not backlit but it is so much easier to read with,although i love the one that i had bought for use in 
4.0,nice,four stars
4.0,it is my very first ever step into the electronic book world a dear friend purchased this and gave it to me as a gift most unexpected i probably would not have bought this for myself i like the feel of a book in my hand the smell of the paper and ink i like to see them laying on the table on the shelf but my life is changing drastically in so many ways that the kindle seems to be part of that change i find it delightful to be able to read books instantly i see it i download it i read it or i keep it for another day the prices for these downloads are frightening because they are so easy to download so i search the bargain book bins watch for prime specials and will see if my local library provides ebook downloads for free and with a chance to travel i can take the kindle with me more easily than booksthis product has made my transition to the electronic world of books most enjoyable it is easy to use although having a sheet of instructions would have been nice the touch screen is great except i tend to eat when reading greasy fingerprints the ability to change font size etc the ability to see what i have stored on my kindle is helpful and storage on the cloud sounds inviting and the kindle is easy to hold easy to use even my cat has learned to turn pages i tend to want to touch the pages of a book and run my finger along a line of print with the touch screen such actions turn the page but this first kindle experience is turning me into an ebook believer and the kindle gift itself has so touched my life with its generosity and caring thoughts,kindle opens worlds of books
5.0,good,five stars
5.0,i cant believe how affordable the kindle has gotten get this one with the special offers ads for the best deal works perfectly im not really sure why anyone would bother buying the more expensive ones,great value
1.0,not at all user friendly i much prefer my first kindle or my fire hd i would no recommend it to anyone,i would no recommend it to anyone
4.0,at first i really hated this reader i was so used to my ipad and it just drove me crazy when i tried to search fordownload books on it or even when i used it to read everything is a bit clumsy and cheap feelingbut now i like it a lot and see some real benefits for one if you are just reading its very very light unlike my ipad and easy to carry anywhere without a cover or any protection you can even slip it in a large coat pocket the best things are that you can read it like a book outside in the sun and in bed without the backlight stimulating your brain before sleep you cant even see my ipads outside unless you are reading at night also you just dont have to worry about it if i take my ipad or my new ipad mini on a flight to read at the beach or waiting for an appointment i worry a bittheft damage sand with this you dont have to the plastic makes it somewhat bulletproof if its lost or stolen its a drag but not a big issue given the price and the fact that there is nothing on it but booksi also use it to read free overdrive books from various libraries if you dont know about this service check it out immediately you can download books from your computer or ipad if you dont want to download it on this device it works but the browsing for books isnt idealfor me i love having both types of readers and this one has proven to be ideal for many situationshope this helps you digital readers out there,disliked it at first but its very light no backlight for bed great for beach travel less worry than ipadexpensive reader
1.0,received a kindle paperwhite for a gift and cant figure out what the heck i would want one for sorry,received a kindle paperwhite for a gift and cant figure 
5.0,a gift for my daughter who had been taking my wifes kindle she really loves it and it works well we all prefer the display of the kindle for reading as compared to tablet phone or computer screens now i just have to keep her in the reading material she wants,excellent ereader
5.0,i had previously purchased one for myself and liked it so much that i bought one for my 93 year old young mother who is an avid reader she thinks it is just fantastic and is learning all of its ins and outs,i had previously purchased one for myself and liked it so much that i bought one for my 
1.0,i did not realize that it was not a lit screen so i will be returning it it was a good product for the price though,it was a good product for the price though
1.0,i love to read in bed at night and did not realize it did not have a lighted background so it is not what i needed,i love to read in bed at night
5.0,my daughter loves this kindle she loves the touchscreen and how when you turn it off and turn it back on it remembers where you were on your book i like how it has parental controls so i can block the browser and wifi on it i would not have purchased it if i wasnt able to block these things the only thing i would change is one thing she forgot her password and could not open the kindle so i researched online how to open it and quickly found a code that would reset it this worked although it reset it back to factory settings and she was able to use it again but now the parental controls are off of it if the child knows the wifi password they can get on the browser easily so i feel that amazon should somehow change that part where anyone can look up the code online to open the kindle if it is locked maybe they could make the parent contact them through their email and they send us a password that way this part would only bother you if you are a parent who likes to monitor internet usage like me other than that which may not bother some people i love the kindle it is great i would recommend it to others,very happy with the kindle
3.0,i hoped the screen would be back lit so that i could read at night without a reading light otherwise it works well,i hoped the screen would be back lit so that 
5.0,now i can keep all my books in one place uses the same charger as most things now days and to top it off i barely ever have to charge it i recommend this over the tablets since the liquid ink display doesnt hurt my eyes, off i barely ever have to charge it i recommend this over the tablets since the liquid ink display

3.0,i bought this for my wife and she doesnt have the vision problems that i have and even she has a hard time reading the screen on this kindle as it is way too dim i can barely read it at all i have found there is no way to increase the brightness i have been told by amazon that there is no way to do so my wife said shed just put up with the problem as it was a gift from methis kindle reader is not disabled friendly or accessible to those that have any sort of vision problems or problems with their hands i am disappointed i would not buy this for myself i was told by amazon that i can just spend more to get a better reader or tablet,screen is too dim
3.0,this kindle does not have adjustable back light this is not explained or specified well on the web site description,this kindle does not have adjustable back light this 
5.0,ive always wanted to read the count of monte cristo paperback is about 4 or 5 inches thick downloaded it on my new kindle and its very easy to read this is new to me but finding it very convenient and glad i finally bought one will especially be nice to have when i take vacation and use in airports and on flights,downloaded it on my new kindle and its very easy to read
2.0,love the feel of paperback books couldnt get used to having an electronic for reading novels had to send it back,love the feel of paperback books
1.0,i hate this more than any other of my kindles and i have had many many kindlesthis one is so buggy that it makes me incredibly frustrated for example it is constantly transforming the font size because of accidentally activating fontsizechange why who changes font size maniacsthe forward backward is a ruthles angry tap not a simple clickit is thick and heavier than any previous editionit cut my husbands head open when he somehow managed to bump itthe functionality is so betamode that i am sad sad sad that my nice little kindle committed suicide the other week,want to pay to be betatester no nor did isigh
3.0,the ads are really distracting and stupid i keep my screen turned off when not reading so i dont have to see them,the ads are really distracting and stupid i keep my screen turned off when not 
5.0,still very happy with my kindle tablet since july 2015 it also fits nicely in my purse for onthego i use it mainly to read my kindle collection of ebooks from the kindle app so that i wont have to drain the battery on my cell phone the only drawback is that the battery drains completely within hours of reading so i find myself having to charge it every day other than that i love this tablet i did not purchase insurance on this tablet and have not had any problems i have used several different tablets in the past and i have to say that this is my favorite tablet of all i even like this tablet much better than my husbands samsung galaxy 4 tab,still very happy with my kindle tablet since last year
3.0,gave this as a gift should have spent the extra and got the fire this one is smaller and a little harder to read,gave this as a gift should have spent the 
3.0,this kindle is easy to use and i enjoy reading books on it it is light and compact and downloads books fast however the material it is made of is far inferior to previous versions after 3 months of use it has scratches on it all over the casing it was not thrown around it has been inside a laptop bag in a padded pocket for the duration my wife has an older generation kindle and that one has been around for years and there is barely a scratch visible with no cover on it for entire time the quality of material has definitely decreases significantly,still great reading device material its made of degraded
3.0,you get what you pay for having all kind of trouble with this do not buy low grade kindle its not worth it,you get what you pay for having all kind 
4.0,very smooth it has a small left over of fading of letters when the epaper refreshes the touch screen is not as accurate and quick as my smart phone its slower you can go online for a few things the off screen is my most favorite and passed my little drop test nothing sounds loose when i shake it its well made when i read i read 4 times a week i usually dont read more than an hourso the battery should last long for me,the touch screen is not as accurate and quick as my smart phone its slower
2.0,i saw wifi and thought the kids could use it for homework games nope i have no need for a glorified book cover,i saw wifi and thought the kids could use it 
4.0,i bought one of these for myself and one as a gift for my sister i love it and so does she you should realize before you but this that it is just for reading books the display looks exactly like paper unlike earlier eink displays this reacts fast and its touchscreen is really functional the only con is that in lower light settings the contrast isnt the best if you love to read books like me you cant go wrong with this,great for books
5.0,this kindle is so easy to use really light in weight i love you can use it outside in the bright sun a tablet you cant see the words but on this kindle you can just like a book this would make a perfect christmas gift,this kindle is so easy to use
1.0,dont buy this kindledo you have a lot of time to reboot this device over and over again if you put the book kindle down for a few minutesdo you want to increasedecrease screen brightness sorryit doesnt do itonly read in well lit spaceswould you like to change the gotosleep time if you go attend food on the stove while reading youve got maybe 2 or 3 minutes until you have to reboot this kindleheres the big problem with this must be 1st version kindle none or the device performance features that you would expect with a typical smartphone are availablefirst major inconvenience situationsay youve got to put the book this kindle down for a few minutes to check my clothes dryerfood in the ovenetcwhen you get back the kindle has timed out and it must be restarted booted up again there is no kindle setting for this idle time to reboot periodbecause of a little idle time the kindle must be rebooted is time consuming this consists of holding down the power button and waiting for 10 to 12 seconds and then waiting for the boot screen from there you get a boot time odometer then runs for about 15 to 30 secondsconclusion so just this complete reboot until you can read again  is for 2 to 3 minutesscreen brightness there are no controls whatsoever you can choose is text style and size that itendno brightness paper color nothingyou cannot read this in a darkened room a paperback although heavier is still a little more convenient easy to see that this kindlethis kindle has good synchronization with an amazon account wifi connection settings and other social media liking featuresbut compared to even a cheap cell phone nothing zeroi would not purchase have purchased this kindle knowing these deficiencies i would have spent an additional 40 just for the basic features like available on all current cellphones in order to prevent having to spend time time and time again rebooting this kindle between small breaksi can read fine with it it loads my ebooks perfectly i can link to my amazon accountsits just that most settings you would expect for such a device are just missing common device settings as a reading device its great as a replacement for a paperback book it sucksregardsd dogoood,a feature free kindle to avoid
5.0,i love this little sucker so light and has a ton of memory if you want a backlit reader then do not get this one however if you are comfortable with reading text like a normal book then treat yourself i am addicted to reading this little kindle is perfect super tiny and very light i love it,i love this little kindle
1.0,need light every tablet need light to read at night this was a bad interventioni would not recommend this so no one nothing but bad,dont waste money
4.0,i liked my old broken one better but this is almost as good my only drawback is that when i divide my books up into categories they are still all out there instead of neatly tucked away until i open the proper category i mean with 130 books and counting thats a lot of books to flick through,almost as good as my old one
1.0,seven months is all for this machine i sure got bit again the green light still blinks but the touch will not wake up the machine,bad kindle
5.0,i got this for christmas i believe i have read 9 books since then i love everything about it i can enlarge the print and read it while on the treadmill its easy to operate and i had no problem figuring out how to use it i highly recommend it and my daughter now wants one for her birthday,an awesome ereader
3.0,z exa,three stars
5.0,this is my sixth kindle actually it is for my daughter i can see it is improved in many ways than even the first generation of paper white the touch screen is smooth and sensitive i like it and hope my daughter will read a lot on it,i like it and hope my daughter will read a lot 
3.0,great,three stars
4.0,i had this in my cart for forever before i finally decided to buy it i always used my ipad for reading but because of the glare i couldnt take it outsidethis is lightweight and easy to read i gave it a 4 star because it would be nuce to adjust contrast on the screen but this is a entry level user and it doesnt have that feature or a backlight and in hindsight i should of bought one with the backlightin a low lite room i find it hard to readbut its super simple to use and read im glad i finally coughed up the cash for itif you can afford a little more def go for the backlight as it makes a difference otherwise if your thrifty cheap like me this works just fine,great purchase
4.0,i was disappointed that i didnt get 15 off the charger which i bought at the same time the info about discount came only afterwards,missing discount
5.0,i purchased this on amazon prime day and it arrived so quickly i finished one book within a day of receiving it i love this thing so much it has revamped my interest in reading i was so annoyed with books and having to apply so much pressure to each page to get the book flat with this kindle i dont have to worry about that i can read perfectly fine without my glasses too i just love this thing it has made reading enjoyable again it is packed full of features like the most common highlights within a book the built in dictionary and even the web browser you cant go wrong with this kindle it an awesome buy and the offers keep book searching interesting,why did i wait so long
2.0,not happy screen is dark and made me squint used to have a kindle fire shouldnt have been cheap returning it for another fire,return
4.0,i really like my kindle its easy to read small enough to fit in my purse and no glare but though i keep buying kindle books i really really prefer paper books its just not the same with a kindle its hard to explain why it is an amazing little device i really want to like it better and its not the hard plastic devices fault that i prefer paper its definitely more sensible than a book it takes up much less space than all the books it carries in its memory and ebooks are less expensive are instantly available and dont kill trees but still its just not the same if you do decide to try an ereader i recommend it the distractions you have with an ipad disappear thats why i got the kindle its also very affordable for what it is its great but still not a book,great little device but not the same as reading a traditional paper book 
2.0,the ereader was not what i expected the size was ok but there was no color and the functions were not easily understandable,and the functions were not easily understandable
5.0,i have always loved the feel of a real paper book and i am not usually a high tech advocate but after using the kindle paperwhite for a month im hookedmake sure to get the paperwhite model it is lightweight and easy to hold with one hand the device battery lasts forever between charges with easy viewability in bed and no need to turn on bedside lamp i just lay it down when im sleepy and the screen automatically shuts off i recommend separate purchase of a screen protector as a fairly inexpensive way to preserve your investmentim retired and on a limited budget there are so many free books to download from the public library and no need to even travel there because downloading a library book to the kindle is an easy online process i will have saved enough money by not buying from used bookstores to pay off the kindle paperwhite in 6 months,kindle paperwhite is a great invention
3.0,amazon advertises on my kindle even when the kindle is turned off the ads change aside from that i am pleased with the device,pleased but not with ads
5.0,i love my wifi kindle the ads show when i first open my kindle but after that i never see them talk about hasslefree and unobtrusive in fact let me tell you how convenient this device isi lived overseas in a nonenglish speaking country a few bookstores had fullpriced books in eng our group of esl teachers would pass our books along to one another or wait all year for the used book fair then i bought my kindle during a trip back to the us i learned i could log into my local library back in the us via my laptop or my smartphone i would then check out an ebook i turned on my kindle and activated the wifi in 15 seconds my new library book was downloaded i easily saved the 79 cost of my kindle while downloading library books while 7500 miles from home try reading one of these kindles on a sunny day no glare i love it,i was drug kicking and screaming into the 21st century and now i wonder why i took so long
1.0,much more difficult to turn on than my older kindle first you get the advertisements then you have to swipe screen before you even get to your books not very happy with it and would not recommend it,not so simple
4.0,it is hard for me to operate the may functions provided by the kindle i read the guide and it is long and hard to follow,it is hard for me to operate the may functions 
4.0,cant really give much of a review i had this for only two days my brother bought this for me as a gift but since he was visiting i let my girlfriend borrow it next day her parents found out we were dating and they hate me so they took it and ive never seen it since but since amazon keeps bugging me with emails here it goesbattery good never had to charge it only read for about 45 minutes on itdisplay excellent i tried reading it outside as well as in bed screen allows for readability anywhere as long as you have a lightfunction i wanted this to have a portable way to read books instead of dragging my laptop everywhere i believe this would have performed admirably i also dont like bookstores since i am a giant nerd they often are lacking in the nerdy books i like to read to make room for 1000 copies of fifty shades of grey i think online bookstores are the way to gobonus did not expect this to come with its own web browser it has limited capabilities but i think that might have been a handy feature when sitting on the couch watching tv and the need to google something arises,dont let your gf borrow it
4.0,lots of people have already posted their reviews about this device i got it for 49 on prime day for that price it certainly is worth it i got it mainly to take to places where i know im going to have to sit around and be bored like at the dmv or doctors officei like to read in bed and have been using my ipad id rather use this kindle but because it isnt backlit i would have to leave my light on which id rather not do so i can only use this new kindle in daylightas far as the ads are concerned they only show up when the device is turned off so its really no big deal and certainly worth a 20 discountthe battery life is great ive had it on about an hour each day and still havent needed to charge itthe clarity of the screen is excellent i have lowered the size of the typeface to practically its minimum and maximized the number of lines per page to nearly maximum and the screen looks essentially like a paperback book its very easy to readand i really like being able to highlight a word and get a definition almost immediately the lookup functionality of the kindle device is far better than what i get when i use the kindle app on my ipadone other advantage of the kindle device over the app is that i can now borrow books directly from amazon i already have read one borrowed book and the process was seamlessi would have given it five stars if only it had come with a backlight was a bit thinner and still was priced so low,good for the price
2.0,i wish this kindle had backlight im have major trouble finding the correct lighted case for this kindle online ill have to take it into the store,definitely needs a case wa light 
4.0,so far this has been what i expected the ads dont bother me i like getting classic books from project gutenberg its not as fancy as an ipad and i have an ipad but i prefer to read books on a kindle so i dont clutter up the cloud,i like getting classic books from project gutenberg
3.0,i was disappointed that the screen was not back lit otherwise the i love the size i have bought about 8 kindles so far each one is my favorite,i was disappointed that the screen was not back lit
5.0,great when my older kindle didnt work despite rebooting i didnt want to do without it for even one day its amazing how attached ive become to my ereader i went from a keyboard model no longer available new to the new touchscreen display love the swipe features easttoread instructions for adding notes highlighting text faster internet connection the only drawback was my solitaire and spades games from my earlier kindle edition did not travel to this newest kindle besides reading ebooks these games were my goto feature to play in my downtime at night while watching a favorite movie i did buy tetris to play on this new kindle but i havent yet tried it out also i had over one thousand ebooks to transfer over and i found it faster to charge the new kindle first and upload ebooks from the cloud on the device itself rather than selecting twentyatatime from the amazoncom website under manage your content and devices,great love the swipe features
1.0,didnt come with a plug to charge the device i just expected it would have came with a light so you could read it since its a electronic device,didnt come with a plug to charge the device 
1.0,i was very unhappy with this kindle from the moment i got it charged up there was not enough contrast to be able to read the titles of books even the special offers looked very dim i contacted customer support and asked repeatedly if this was a defect for this particular kindle but the lady i spoke with said they are all that way my old kindle is much easier to read than this new technology and that doesnt make any sense to me to add insult to injury she said i wouldnt have to pay to send it back but i still got charged for the return shipping,not enough contrast
3.0,i would like for this device to not only store books but a library of editorials short stories academic research articles and notable essays,make this device a library for articles too
4.0,its a lovely ereader but i should have read more carefully im not at all sure that i would have taken the discounted price if id known that the screen saver would be ad after ad best or worse of all the advertising so far is for products that id never even consider buying,with special offers means with advertising
1.0,i really dont like anything about it i bought it because my original kindle is wearing out i thought i could get the same one but noooooo,i really dont like anything about it
5.0,after reading reviews for this product i decided it was the best for me i just needed a way to read my books on the go and didnt need any of the fancy features the newer kindles have the lack of a backlight hasnt been an issue and neither has the power button being on the bottomin fact i like it better this way i also decided not to buy the power adapter because it came with a power cord that plugs into either my laptop or iphone charger adapter using the usb port i would highly recommend this product for anyone looking for new lower priced books at your fingertips,great product
1.0,display screen is frozen and i cannot access the library or anything else battery is fully charged what is my next step,display screen is frozen and i cannot access the library 
5.0,bought for my daughter ar christmas and she loves it reads all the time mostly stephen king but what can you say also bought a cover and ereader and the set goes well nicely great kindle for the money touchscreen wont be long before her son takes over,great kindle
2.0,thedevice did not function i was unable to get instructions or assistance my requests for instructs and orders for books were ignored,unhappy customer
4.0,if you just want a light ereader that you can carry around to read novelsthis kindle is perfect the only reason that i gave 4 stars instead of 5 is that i wasnt aware that there is no audio on this version when i purchased it my previous black and white kindle which was not touch screen had audio and i loved it right up until it died with no sound i cant do audio books and no text to speech on this version i dont need all the full tablet features of the kindle fire but no audio is a definitely drawback,choose fire instead if you want to listen
1.0,i have over 40 books on old kindle pc most of which cant be transferred to new 6 kindle because i have 81 and they wont transfer,i have over 40 books on old kindle pc 
4.0,a nice little treat for daytime readers as it does not have a built in light but hey you can get a clip on light and then its go time there are also a number of decent free e books available which is nice too it also has some nice features like font choice vocabulary builder and dictionary for words you can look up as you are reading a good deal for the money,love my kindle
1.0,i have never bought any kind of electrical device that did not include the power adaptor seriously you have to buy a separate power adaptor for 1500 to make this flimsy piece of plastic work,no power adaptor included
1.0,hard to set uppoor directionsi will try before i return itall i wanted is to read the instructions for the a6000 sony,poor directions i will try before i return it
1.0,product is not user friendly i intend to return the item because i was unable to obtain any reading materialand couldnot see the screenvery disappointing,product is not user friendly i intend to return 
3.0,this would be all i need but i missed the fact that it doesnt have a light this means i cant read in any place with poor light other than that its very nice,this means i cant read in any place with poor light other than that its very nice
1.0,this product is junk i owned a kindle for years and then i dropped in on a stone table and it quit working rightly so i bought this as a replacement and handled it with kid gloves and without cause it quit in less than 6 months what a lemon,piece off junk in less than 6 months
3.0,thanks,three stars

2.0,i like size but i dont like that it doesnt have a light in it so you have to read with light like a regular book i wouldnt have bought it if i had known that,i like size but i dont like that it doesnt have 
5.0,i wasnt sure if i should purchase a fancy color model or just stick with this plain little ereader after doing some research i decided on this one because it isnt backlit and so it is supposed to be easier on the eyes i work on a computer all day and wanted something that wouldnt further strain my eyes this is a great little reader its small light weight and convenient to carry in my purse and its never given me any reading discomfort its easy to use and the battery life is great i only charge it once every couple of weeks,a great little ereader
3.0,i wish i would have seen it didnt have a builtin light i would have bought something else i feel i could have gotten the same results as a paper book,i wish i would have seen it didnt have a 
5.0,im never without my kindle paperwhite i just wish that the cellphone companies would have the same technology as this product so that i could see my cellphone screen in the sunlight just like i can see my kindle in the sunlight,i love my paperwhite
2.0,disappointed,two stars
5.0,first touch screen basic reader that have gotten their is a learning curve but not as touchy as the kindle fire takes a little time to learn where to touch screen to go where you want it very good for someone who hast had a touch screen readers to learn on and wants one very satisfied with it and would recommend this to others looking just f wanting to read books speed better than earlier one with buttons which i have each generation brings changes which for most part are a plus course if you have to have buttons this one will not work for you,touch scree basic reader
1.0,dammit amazon i just left my old kindle on a plane i dont want a touch screen i want a simple version will try to find anything but a kindle now,dammit amazon i just left my old kindle 
5.0,ive bought and am reading my first book and so far i really have no complaints purchasing an ereader has been on my wish list for quite sometime and when amazon posted a special offer in my email i just couldnt pass it up i suppose the only negative would be theres no back light but thats ok i am still enjoying my kindle 6 glarefree touchscreen thank you,first ereader ive had and i love it
2.0,i would like to return it and purchase another its not what i thought it was havent use it just wanna purchase something else maybe kindle fire ,i would like to return it and purchase another
5.0,i bought it i love it eink is fascinating i cant wait to see where else this technology takes us ive used this for a school textbook and many novels even though i bought a refurbished model anyone would have thought it was new it arrived packaged nicely and looks pristine be sure to get a sturdy cover for it my spouse broke his because he didnt use a cover and had to replace it i dont feel the need for the paperwhite i just want to read it the way i read a paper book under normal lighting conditions if you think you cant afford to buy all new books from amazon remember that you can borrow ebooks from the library many classic novels are only a dollar or two and older or obscure titles are also very affordable,i love this thing
3.0,a little disappointed that this doesnt have a light i thought they all did at this point buyer beware i guess at least they have a great return policy,a dim review
5.0,i originally purchased a cheap samsung tablet to do some reading with the kindle app but the backlight would hurt my eyes and i couldnt read for very long without getting the text lines burned into my retinas staring too long at those backlit devices really drove me nutsi decided to buy this kindle when it was on sale and im loving it now the terrible retina burning doesnt happen its just like reading paper ive had my kindle for a couple of months now and i use it all the time its exactly what i was looking for even though its nothing too fancy i just wanted to be able to read cheap books with one electronic device and this is it the special offers arent intrusive at all i notice them just enough to wonder if the book they advertise is what i want to read and sometimes they are everything works great on it and the battery life is unbelievable this was a fantastic purchase i love my kindle i do recommend getting a cover for it id hate something sharp to puncture the screen i bought an off brand that works great for this,doesnt hurt the eyes exactly what i needed
4.0,havent compared it to anything else does what i need it for still prefer hard copy books and dont enjoy having one more electronic device to charge,and dont enjoy having one more electronic device to charge
3.0,i dont know what to write on the review i mean ive never owned a kindle book before and have never seen one before it is definitely glare free it is pretty small but not too small i am getting used to this i do not have anything bad to say about it it is definitely differently than the kindle on my pc i dont know what to say the pages turn okay it is the referencing that i am trying to get used to no directions came with the kindle and i do know i can not switch books unless i turn it off and reset it resetting doesnt erase anything it just takes you back to the books it is a good thing so far  i have nothing negative to say about this kindle book it is better than the nook just from looking at it and handling it the nook is more like a tablet and i dont like that the kindle book is different nice different i just wish they came in different colors i really do not like the black at all but i am still not complaining i got it on sale if you are wanting to buy one you just have to make sure this is what you want the no glare is nice i need to buy a case for it or make one myself which shouldnt be too hard i think the average book reader will like it very much you should get one just dont allow yourself to get frustrated over it if you have never owned one it will take time but it is a good thing to have for novels not for school books though,its a nice little thing to have the no glare is a bonus
5.0,my sight is forced 10 hours a day in front of a computer now i can read with this eink reader and it is pretty awesome it is as faster as i need has a dictionary includes i can use with my book and find in wikipedia that is all i need i can surf in the web with the experimental browser and the battery omg i love dont think in battery for an entire month,pretty awesome
1.0,i was not impressed with this product the screen is gray not white the text seems very pixelated no matter the font or size i set it at the screen is far too dark as well,i was not impressed with this product the screen 
1.0,i could not open most of my books there as the file was not supported on this device besides the device screen is too small im returning the product as its not beneficial,i could not open most of my books there as 
4.0,i was happy to get it while it was an amazon deal it is a very basic model only for reading that is all i need it to doi own several kindles and switching from one to another i have to remember how each functions a little bit differently from the otheri was devastated when my original kindle died on i look back and know i overloaded it and used it more than is was designed fori really wished it could have been repairedthe only way this one could be better is if it could have a light but for the price i can work around thatbe sure to turn off wifi when not needed to increase reading time before needing a rechargei bought this as a backup to read on when my other one is recharging and i have a third one that i allow others to borrow or read oni do still read physical books but this is much more convenient and private to carry around,very basic model only for reading
1.0,not the same as my original one no backlight cant see what im reading i should return it if your looking at this dont buy it not the same quality as the original one,no backlight cant see it to read
5.0,i really like this kindle im very pleased that amazon is still offering a kindle without a built in light reads very much like a book the touch screen took no time at all to get used to i traded in my old kindle keyboard for this one and am very happy loss of the page turning buttons is no big deal and it gives me more area on the sides to hold the device i like tapping the screen for page turns i miss my old kindle keyboard word jumble game but since this is purely for reading thats no big deal either as i have plenty of other devices to play games on,really like it
1.0,i am too overwhelmed cant find what i am looking for lost all my books on the kindle that broke anddidnt even read the last books i purchased when it broke,i am too overwhelmed cant find what 
5.0,i read a lot of and mostly ant night before i go to sleep the kindle lets me keep all my reading material in one place and i can download the books i like to read i dont have to go to a book store this is great,the kindle lets me keep all my reading material in one place and i can download the books i like to read
1.0,im disappointed this reader is smaller than the original and has no side openings for cover clips therefore it doesnt fit into my two very nice leather kindle covers,this kindle wont fit my original covers 
4.0,avid reader who always has a book to read when im on vacation i take several books to read but lugging those around while traveling adds weight and bulk so i decided to give this a try choose the kindle with no frills downloaded two books i like the dictionary the highlight feature and can be taken anywhere still love physical books but this is a good alternative,i like the dictionary
3.0,i like it but i can only give it three stars reason being no light in low light conditions its hard to use if you dont have external light this is my first kindle,serves its purpose
5.0,i bought this for my daughter i now use it for myself i have a few kids books on it but she likes the color pictures im always amazed at the selection of books available wish they werent so expensive though some books its actually been more expensive as an ebook,im always amazed at the selection of books available
2.0,i did not know this product did not come with a reading backlight feature yes i should read the specifications but given this is the latest model it should have at minimum existing features of earlier models,i did not know this product did not come with

5.0,just received this and tried it out i immediately saw the improvement over the last version which i have now retired i bought the last three lowrent versions and the last one still had the side buttons i love the touchscreen i like seeing the book cover when i select a book yayone thing i would like and which kindle doesnt appear to do yet is to touch a book in my library and see its description and what i paid for it i dont recall half the time why i downloaded a book i download a bunch of them and whether i purchased it or downloaded it for free it would be nice to prioritize something i paid for clearly i felt the purchase was urgent right or even type a note on why i thought it might be interesting sometimes context matters when i finish one book and select the next oneif this kindle does all that and i just havent figured it out please comment and let me know thanks,great and now for the next version
3.0,it is great during the day or in a light but if someone can not see not good and not good in low lightingso i returned and upgraded to the kindle hd 6,it is great during the day or in a light
5.0,exactly what i needed i own an ipad mini and usually read there with the kindle app but the backlighting kills my eyes over long periods of time since this didnt have a light i am reading so much more its also awesome for reading in bring daylight battery life is amazing im on 25 weeks with no charging love the ads too it gives me idea on what to read next great deal since i also got it during their sale for 59,just what i needed
1.0,i am disappointed i owned a kindle before this that i had a lot of books on and games i called before i ordered to make sure these items would be on my new one i was told they would be they are not or i cannot find them it is not what i thought it would be i am returning it,i am disappointed i owned a kindle before this that i 
5.0,this is a great kindle i used to have the kindle keyboard it is much easier to maneuver around when you can touch the screen as opposed to having to press buttons to control everything it was smartly designed the battery also lasts longer as long as you leave it in airplane mode i also discovered goodreads through using this kindle which is sort of builtin its a great site and app to help you organize the books youve read want to read and to get suggestions for books from friends reviews back to the kindle it is great you have to treat it like a paper book and make sure you have enough light none are builtin but there are clipon light accessories you can buy since the screen is glarefree as advertised you can read outside in bright sunlight i took this to the beach with me and it was great highly recommended,solid update to the wonderful kindle
5.0,i picked up this nofrill kindle during a sale at staples for 6500 after having my nexus 7 returned to me i loaned it to a friend with a cracked screen and a broken digitizer i realized that i really only used it for reading anyway so i went ahead and bought this kindle i couldnt be more pleased with this purchasethough admittedly im not familiar with the other reading devices such as nook sony ereader ipad etc i cant imagine any competitor could significantly improve on this kindles cost to quality ratio with the nexus 7 i was limited to reading inside because even hazy daylight blotted out the text on that devices screen with this kindle such restrictions are meaningless due to the devices paperlike background on which the text is displayed need larger text for poor eyesight noproblemo whatsoever this kindles text selection offers lettering which runs the entire gamut from the miniscule to the humongous all the other various perks one might expect to find on higherend devices have been generously included in this baseline model including 2 dictionaries a goodreads app book info as well as author info vocabulary builder and various other apps and settings which make this reading device a fabulous bargain and hard to beat for the price,this kindle delivers the most bang for your buck
5.0,this was a gift from my daughter i really like it as she is my source for books as i am on a limited budget i still prefer reading actual books rather than on a kindle however i am enjoying this would recommend thank you have a great day god bless,i really like it as she is my source for books as 
5.0,i got this for a diehard paperback lover and she loves it she was skeptic but has been sold the only draw back is that when she finishes a book she can quickly get sucked into another get it for the purest they will be swayed,got for the purest
1.0,the apps for this kindle were so limited i recently lost my first edition kindle and i loved it this kindle was so far behind the first edition that being said i got what i paid for,i recently lost my first edition kindle and i loved it this kindle was so far behind the 
5.0,love my new kindle i bought the fire hd tablet before buying an ereader and i always get distracted and start playing games or wanting to watch a video with this i get to just read my books with out being tempted to do something else plus i love when i have to read long documents for work i can email them straight to my kindle and read then any where at home out side or even bring it up during my meetings and i dont have to hassle with a bunch of paperwork its all at my finger tips,why didnt i buy one sooner
1.0,i do not understand the point of this device it is small and super cheaply madeterrible quality and the lighting makes it impossible to read in bed with low lighting returning asap,dont waste your money
5.0,this is a nifty little kindle that perfectly fulfills the need for which i bought it i have a kindle fire but in preparing for a trip to australia and new zealand i wanted a portable ereader that was lighter weight and had a longer battery life than my fire i also wanted to be able to read it in the sunlight cant do that with the fire a paperwhite might also have been an option but it is pricier than this kindle its true this kindle doesnt have a backlight but then neither do regular books i havent found this to be a problem at all before ereaders we always had to have an outside light source to read a book and we didnt give it a second thought this little kindle still has multiple options that are the same as my fire such as wifi and the builtin dictionary that lets me look up the meaning of a word instantly all in all i love it very light weight less than a paperback extremely long battery life especially in airplane mode and many options for changing the font style and size im looking forward to carrying it with me on my trip so portable convenient and readable also because of the price breaki got the version with the ads they are very unobtrusive only the screen saver and not bothersome at all,nifty little kindle perfect for travel
4.0,i was disappointed it did not have a backlight i still cant figure out why the pages skip sometimes but overall i like the experience especially the dictionary and highlight feature,i was disappointed it did not have a backlight
4.0,great way to read your books on the go the display never hurts your eyes your reading experience is fully customizable and thanks to the 4 gb internal storage you probably wont need external storage devices adding books from amazon is extremely simple and books from other sources can also be easily uploaded provided the format is correct the device does not accept epub so make sure your books are saved as pdf what really helped me immerse myself in the reading experience was the vocabulary builder all words you search in the dictionary are store and every now and then you can pop over to see how many words you remember searching a word in the dictionary is also easy just tap it setup is quick weight feels just right and the home menu has the perfect design,best tool for reading on the go
3.0,the 6 glarefree touchscreen is only 434 x 312 actual screen description misleadingfont size from normal to big missing one sizedisappointed,disappointed
3.0,the cheapie with center toggle and side button page turns is still the best it allows for excellent collection making and errors are few because you dont arrive somewhere unexpected because of butterfingers this one is not bad but it is heavier and not my favorite simple cheap idiot proof and intuitively organizable is my way,butterfingers
2.0,i am still figuring out this kindle much more difficult to use than the previous one that one worked fine until it just died with this one i am never sure how to find what i want,how do i use this
5.0,when i first received my kindle i was skeptical of whether or not this reading experience would be more enjoyable than holding a physical book i often view books as friends and i believed that like friends experiences with them in person are more rewarding than through electronic communication however this device proved me wrong i love having access to all of my books in the palm of my hand being able to easily search particular parts of the book this is most helpful when writing papers and needing to access quick notes as well as having access to an instant dictionary i highly recommend checking out kindle if youve never had one before this is particularly useful for travelers students and avid readers the only other device i use more often than my kindle is my cell phone,talk about a productive tool
2.0,i cannot get the screen to lighten i much preferred my old one which had the light that you could change for light and dark rooms the screen is too dark and very difficult to read,i cannot get the screen to lighten i much 
5.0,this kindle is perfect for those that just want a simple ereader i have recommended this model to several friends and family members as i use mine all the timethe functionality and organization options are great and it is easy to use and navigate the battery lasts for weeks when in airplane mode and the browser and storefront work better on this one than my older generation kindle the touchscreen is very sensitive and can be used even with thick gloves on i have a thin cover on mine and even though i have dropped it several times it stills works perfectly and looks brand new even though it has proven to be fairly sturdy i would recommend getting a cover for it,a great purchase
1.0,no backlight at all so dark you just cant see it after several hours on the phone to tech they confirmed there was no adjustment to backlight because there was no backlight,no backlight at all so dark 
5.0,i chose this item after much deliberation i am the type of person who loves technology but found myself not enjoying reading as much from my tablet or from my computer and iphone as much as i always do from books unable to place my finger on the exact reason i had ruled out buying an ereader for quite a while eventually after returning to college the issue was revisited as a matter of money and convenience i would no longer need to go to the store to purchase or return textbooks not to mention no longer having to tote around books heavy enough to start midlife scoliosis i happened to be lucky enough to catch it on sale twenty dollars cheaper with the specials i got off especially cheap having chosen the glare free without backlighting i wanted it to read as close to a real book as possible the touch screen is great it is appropriately responsive and the dictionary feature makes using the text books especially easy also being able to use the go to featur for terms and topics within text is great the battery life is phenomenal its lightweight so i take it everywhere and either entertain myself or study if i have to wait,i love this
1.0,did not like this kindle its so small have a hard time use to it so quit using  thank goodness i found my fire kindle that is what i will be using from now own thank you,did not like

1.0,not worth purchasing if you if your already used to bright screen reading to dark to read since there isnt any back light and the majority of light accessories still doesnt,what a waste
4.0,it doesnt tell you how to borrow books from your library,four stars
5.0,i had been avoiding getting an ereader for so long because i love books but i finally decided it was time because i cant fit all my books anymore this is a wonderful invention i absolutely love the convenience and ease and the reader itself is very comfortable i regret not spending a little extra for the built in light, avoiding getting an ereader for so long because i love books but i finally decided it was time 
5.0,ive had this almost a month i was used to reading on my kindle fire and i was always getting headaches i got this one because it didnt have the same screen as the fire so far its been great no headaches,love this kindle
5.0,this was a gift for my parents very easy to use and they love it fits in a purse and is the same size as a paperback book they travel quite a bit and are always reading amazon carries every book they use masonic lodge and eastern star books they love that they are not carrying an arm load of books the only down is they fight over who gets to use it  my parents are in their 80stouch screen makes it perfect for them very easy to use and they also love the fact that they can change the type sizeive owned kindles from the first gen i currently own a fire however for just reading this is perfect,great gift
2.0,it does work as advertised but the electric discharge is rediculous my eyes blur out when i hold the kindle and my whole body can feel the electricity can someone tell me what to do about this,it does work as advertised but the electric discharge is 
5.0,there are so many benefits to having a kindlei love it its very easy on my eyes light weight so i can carry it with me and it seems that the battery lasts longer overall kindle is truly a great product,kindle review
3.0,other than it came a few days late when i ordered guaranteed 2 day shipping it was pretty good but i do find it pretty lousy when a package is guaranteed to arrive in two days and it doesnt, when i ordered guaranteed 2 day shipping it was pretty good but i do find it pretty lousy 
5.0,if you love to read this is the ereader for you i have had one for two years now and it is wonderful no matter the lighting you can read your books when you download a book it is quick and easy i bought this one for my daughter in law for christmas she also loves to read and was still using her original kindle fire the price was really good right before christmas 49 so i couldnt pass this up i bought a cover for it but had to send it back because it didnt fit so i suggest you spend a little extra and purchase the kindle cover they work well and are very sturdy this book is amazing,a must for readers
4.0,love it,four stars
5.0,i love my kindle 7th generation it does everything i wanted and expected• no back light• no glare• dictionary for unknown words• character summary by tapping names• included 30 day free trial of prime• battery life is fantastic• ability to change font• ability to change text sizesomething that i wasnt aware of is that your kindle is automatically assigned an email address that you can use to send documents directly to your kindle pretty cool the email address is the one you registered to your amazon account kindlecom instead of gmailcom for example easy but you can change it in your settings if you likei was worried that the 6 might be too small but its the perfect size the screen is very clear and the spacing between lines makes it clean looking and easy to read i have not adjusted margin and spacing settings as i like the default but of course you can adjust them the caseing is very sturdy and nice looking the touch screen makes the kindle very easy to use it was also very easy to sign up for prime only one tap it was also easy to sign up for goodreads which allows you to see what your friends are reading read reviews ect im still learning about thatall in all a great buy for anyone who wants a fantastic simple ereader im very happy with it my only complaint is about the special offers on the device that show on the bottom of the home screen and as screen savers when on sleep mode thats not the kindles fault that was me choosing to pay 79 instead of 99 the good thing though is that if you choose to go that route and save the 20 you can later choose to spend the 20 and have the special offers erased from your kindle at any time,great device very recommended
2.0,only ok,two stars
5.0,all i want is an ereader and this fills the bill perfectly the price was great and its smaller and lighter than my previous kindle i did buy a purple cover for it since i carry it in my purse all the time and didnt want any damage all in all im very satisfied,the price was great and its smaller and lighter than my previous kindle
5.0,love it,five stars
4.0,in terms of display and functionality it was what id expected i would have given it 5 stars but im a little disappointed in how thick it is to be clear its not terribly thick and certainly not heavy but i had one of the original 6 kindles with the buttons no touch screen and it was delightfully thin this is purely subjective but this one feels nearly twice as thick but again its not heavy at all its likely due to the touchscreen but id actually prefer one of the thin kindles with buttons but they are no longer available all that being said i got mine for 29 on a oneday sale it was certainly shortlived and it is a tremendous bargain at that price im quite happy with it i have a 7 google nexus tablet with the kindle app that i had been using but i actually much prefer reading on this,thicker than the old button model but still a great reader
4.0,amazing,four stars
5.0,i purchased this kindle for my bf after his old one froze up he loves it the screen is very sharp and clear its also easy to hold it seems a bit thicker than his last one but he hasnt complained about it its also easy to navigate i love the fact that you can save words that youve looked up through the dictionary,very nice kindle for the price
5.0,love it,five stars
5.0,this was a gift for a very happy recipient i have owned several generations of kindles and this one is a good choice for an entry level ereader or someone who isnt concerned about having a lit screen it is small lightweight easy to handle it has plenty of of storage space battery life this kindle doesnt have the finer resolution that the voyage or new paperwhite do but is more than sufficient for the avearge person or someone on a budget i cant compare it to other ereaders but ive always been very happy with the kindles i have owned and highly recommend them,cant go wrong with a kindle
1.0,love it,one star
1.0,instructions very hard to follow and we had to download instructions from on line seems like it is very hard to use do not like it but have already gotten rid of the packaging so can not return too bad,seems like it is very hard to use
3.0,while i like the convenience of the kindle and its very light to carry i did not know that it does not light up in the dark part of purchasing the kindle was so i could read in the dark,no light
4.0,after using a kindle fire for nearly a year this was an adjustment but the device works wonderfully and is easy to use with no light i am limited on the times i use it it will serve its purpose tho and that is to feed my constant need to read,works very well for a basic reader
3.0,it may not be the kindle but rather the status of my vision i chose kindle because reading print became a challenge for me contrast was often a problem and the size and style of print with a book or magazine i had no control kindle allows me to do that i may need to move to a kindle with a backlit screen to improve contrast,it may not be the kindle but rather the 
5.0,before my kindle id stopped reading for pleasure and read mostly for research purposes i felt i just didnt have the time to read a book a kindle makes it easy theres only one small thing to carry around ebooks are easy to either buy or borrow i use my countys online library system to access ebooks for free and have begun two book series as long as you have a wifi connection it takes about 2 minutes to borrow a book online and for all that waiting around that is inevitable in life your medical appointments medical appointments of friends relatives whom you accompany a quiet lunch retreat etc the kindle sure makes the inevitable waiting more enjoyable at bedtime it also helps me calm my brain after a long and busy day i had considered the paperwhite or a backlit version but then i read that it wasnt good for you to use that version at night the basic one that requires you to supply room light just like a regular book is okay i stayed with the 7th generation version and ive been very satisfied if youve been toying with the idea of an ereader and if part of you has been longing to pick up a book again try this basic kindle its not much money and you will be very happy with it,kindle makes it easy to read again for fun
5.0,perfect,five stars
4.0,the only reason i have this 4 states instead of 5 is that i have no idea what the ads will be for i purchased the kindle because i got an email offer from amazon for a reduced price i have had a nook for years now and didnt see that there would be too many advantages to having the kindle let me begini use my library a lot for ebooks as well with the kindle they are transported immediately with the nook i had to manually load the book from my computerthe price was great so far the ads arent bad but they are just there they arent there when i am reading just as the screen saver kind ofthe battery life is similar to the nook without using the glowlight which honestly i rarely did camping was the one time i really appreciated the glow lightthe amazon library and free books granted most of the free books are 1st in a series but its still freethe kindle is a little smaller and lighter it fits into my purse better by faroverall i think i am a convert my nook is going up for sale,so easy to use
5.0,love it,five stars
4.0,seems great unfortunately as soon as i received it amazon dropped their price for the nonrefurb version for cheaper than i got this one i didnt think id enjoy reading on a device but it works well its nice to be able to have multiple books in one place the special offers thing is pretty lame imo basically every time you turn on the device there is an ad for some random book from amazon not a huge deal but still kinda lame i guess you can get one without the ads for a more expensive price but i didnt realize that at the time of purchase the screen does flash when you turn the page screen inverts the lcd which is a little disconcerting at first but you get used to it overall its a great product for what it is,cool but
1.0,i dont like that it doesnt have a light also i like the nook better because its easier to go to the homepage or to the library im kind of disappointed in this it gave the impression that it did have a backlight,i dont like that it doesnt have a light also i like 
4.0,it does exactly what it should it is a lower end ebook reader nice sharp letters fast response right now i have my entire collection on it and it still has plenty of roommy biggest complaint is that i cant reverse the pages i prefer to read white lettering on a black background and that isnt a hard thing to do with an ebook readerall in all though im quite satisfied with the product id been looking for several years and just couldnt pass up the deal the other day and im glad i didnt,exactly what i expected
2.0,the seventh generation kindle was my first i bought it because my techsaavy son recommended it knowing that i was not enamored by the expensive ipad wanted a device mainly to read books and saw no point in paying hundreds of dollars for functions i did not intend to usei guess you get what you pay for the kindle i bought for has turned out to be profoundly disappointingthe socalled glarefree screen is all but invisible except in the brightest and most direct light brightness cannot be adjusted and it is not even remotely readable at any angle other than headon do not expect to use this device on airplanes in bed at at night or sitting in your favorite chair in a dimly lit corner you will go blind if you trythen there is the software which strangely is inferior to the apps kindle provides for other devices do not expect this kindlle to be as responsive or as precise as the kindle apps on your iphone ipad or mac it will be anything butthe bottom line is this i returned the seventh generation kindle and bought the paperwhite instead at least i can read the paperwhtie other than that there is little difference,because my techsaavy son recommended it
5.0,i already own a kindle fire and had gotten tired of trying to be able to read while in direct sunlight i use my kindle fire mostly to watch videos on long trips or at the gym as well as read and as long as i was not in direct sunlight there was no glare off the screen i was looking for a reading kindle and a good deal popped up and i was able to purchase this one for 50 i love it perfect for exactly what i was looking for reading books either purchased or borrowed through amazon lending library and prime i was finally able to sit outside by the pool or at the beach and read my kindle this device is perfectly simple for anyone wanting a reading device without a light it tells you it doesnt come with a light so dont buy it and then give a bad review bc it doesnt come with a light theres a model up from this one that comes with a light,great for what its created for reading
1.0,i dont like that you cannot see the screen in dark places such as your bedroom or car during dusk im a truckers wife and love to read on the road this kindle does not suite me im going to return it in the hopes of finding a better one,too dark
5.0,i have a computer and an ipad which i used to read on so i thought this was unnecessary but i saw it on sale and bought it on a whim and i am so glad i did its the most basic kindle so all i use it for is to read books this device is not even backlit which makes it so so easy on the eyes and better to read on than my ipad its much more gentle and enjoyable the look is pretty close to just actual paper i ride the subway a lot so having this is so light and easy i can fit it in basically any purse and its so handy to have whenever i have a few minutes to read, used to read on so i thought this was unnecessary but i saw it on sale and bought it 
1.0,my recommendation would be to not waste your money on a kindle i have an older model that lasted less than three years amazon offers no repair service they told me my option now is to buy a new kindle no thanks i would rather lug around heavy library books than waste money on this again,my recommendation would be to not waste your money on a kindle
3.0,the good thing about this kindle is that you can use it in bright sun so when i go to the pool it is very good but indoors the screen is so dark that i cannot read anything without a bright indoors light my original paperwhite was very good screen that i could adjust the light and a long battery life but unfortunately it died after only a couple of years i should have read the reviews and i would have known about this problem and ordered the other paperwhite device also the screen is not responsive the print size changes and it is hard to get back,only can be used in bright light
1.0,unable to use device cant down load anything need written instructions much too much info on screen to wade thru books offered are not things i normally read so could i return it for credit,unable to use device cant down load anything 
5.0,i love this kindle it is my third one and read with it more than the other two because the battery lasts such a long tie and i can see the print when im outside it was also a lot cheaper than my first two kindles,love it
2.0,i bought this kindle because my old one run over by a car although i love to read the main thing i wanted was to play the free word games offered by kindle when i received it i discovered i could only play games on the more expensive models,although i love to read
4.0,like it a lotnoticed that during a storm when my power went out i was going to read but no light meant the kindle didnt workwas all set to spend the downtime reading,new kindle
2.0,it was a gift do not like cant see the letters because of dark background i would have been happy with something that did more than just read dont think i will use but the thought was there,do not like cant see the letters because of dark background
5.0,we bought this for my 7 year olds birthday she loves it we use kindle freetime unlimited which allows her free access to tons of books its super easy for her to add books to it she feels like a big kid having access to lots of books we can see what she is reading it even tells us how much progress she is making on books as well as set reading goals i love that this is strictly for reading and not for games she takes it to bed every night and loves to read it in the car or on the go,its super easy for her to add books to it
5.0,what can i say it does what its supposed to and does it well for a reasonable price i resisted getting one for a time because i like having physical books but i just have too many now and the kindle was a nice change,3
5.0,i really enjoy it my original kindle died i like this better than the original because its touch screen much faster to turn pages i would have preferred to buy the paperwhite but this fit my budget better does anything i want,i really enjoy it my original kindle died
5.0,i love my new kindle i was initially opposed to the idea as i love having printed books however i have both printed and kindle versions of my absolute favorite books it is convenient to travel with and read whenever i have a free moment i cannot believe i did not buy a kindle soonermy only concern with purchasing this model rather than the kindle paperwhite was the lack of internal light however i prefer the gray background with black text for daytime reading i also purchased a small light which easily attaches to the case for reading at night a bedside lamp would also provide ample lighting for reading in bedagain i am so pleased with my purchase if you are debating between the paperwhite and this kindle and are not attached to the idea of an internal light i suggest this model i cannot wait to purchase more books,better than i hoped
5.0,i am between a four and five star rating on this kindle i had the one with the keyboard second or third edition along with the first edition i purchased because i dropped my keyboard kindle and the screen got damaged i needed needed a kindle pretty fast i always loved the kindle e readers but really have had to get used to the touch screen i liked using the buttons to navigate through menus i am getting better at using the touch screen also very nice about this kindle is the smaller size and weight both of which i noticed while using and i do appreciate and i purchased on sale so it was a great buy,this is an excellent e reader
3.0,this is my second kindle and i do not like it as much as i do my first one it is frustrating to use does not have as much flexibility for settings and organization as my first kindle the thing i dislike the most about this kindle is that when i have wireless turned off it will turn back on by itself i do not like objects that override my instructions without my permission it also does not allow you to monitor downloads as my first kindle does in the couple of months i have had it it has reset itself more times than my original kindle has in all the years i have owned it i cant imagine what amazon was thinking when they designed the software for this but whatever it was they need to go back to the drawing board,this is my second kindle and i do not like it as much as i do my first one
1.0,no backlightingdoesnt run books apps or internetcan live with just books runningbutdoesnt run brand new kindle kids books like llama llama when you sit down with your child to read it cryptic error messagesno solutionsnothing like a kindle fire hd,doesnt even show some newly purchased books
5.0,i love how this has changed my life id pretty much given up reading had an accident that lost most of my vision and reading is about impossible even with large print and magnifying devices my daughters though that with the ability to increase the font size on here i just might be able to read books again so they got it for me for my birthday best gift ever i can see ive already read one book in a week that would have taken me 6 months or more to read with large print and a magnifying device im on my 2nd book now i just wish the dictionary would have as large of print as the page does very hard for me to see the results even with a magnifying device but im reading easily and enjoying it again after 8 years of not being able to,best birthday gift ever
3.0,biggest problem out of the box is thisyou cannot adjust the brightnessmy wife complains that she cant read in the dark because you cant adjust the brightness it was her birthday gift and shes not all that thrilled about it,cannot adjust brightness
4.0,im really enjoying the experience since i switched from physical books to the kindle many peoples main argument is they dont like reading from a screen and i totally agree while the majority of my time is spent on my phone or computer reading various things the long form of books becomes wearisome for my eyes after extended periods the eink technology definitely replicates the look and feeling of reading a book without the hassle of trying to carry a library with youthis is perfect for someone who loves to read and travels a lot the ease and convienience of having your own personal library in such a small form factor with a battery that lasts as long as the kindle does is really a lifestyle changing experience,annihilates the i hate reading through a screen argument
5.0,icanread,five stars
4.0,this kindle is pretty good i am just starting to use it and i find some of the touchscreen sensitivity annoying and there arent as many straightforward options as id like for example on the home screen i cant swipetap to see the next page but tap on the page number and type in 2 annoying maybe i just havent figured it out yetreading is really nice on this again except the sensitivity of the touchscreen i often find myself accidentally turning pages when i shift position then i have to figure out how many i moved forward etc otherwise i really dont miss having an actual book to flip through for travelers i think a kindle makes a lot of sense and thats the primary reason i got this one,this kindle is pretty good i am just starting to use it
4.0,no review,four stars
4.0,i was really happy to get this device because i needed a small reader with lots of references however i cannot adjust the screen brightness and this is inconvenient sometimes because youre supposed to be able to read in the dark as well as the light i do not find this true in either case and maybe you can tell me how to adjust it its nice to have all my books with me that i need to read and research so that is a definite pro plus i think i also thought it was in color but thats not a problem i did notice however that it doesnt have a speakers and that is one of the pluses for the article until i got this i have been taking my ipad with me and it was good to and of course i could adjust the screen but then you get the advertisements when youre might not want them or something jumps and when youre trying to read that you might not want but i think you might need all in all a nice reader and i enjoy having it with me and easy to carry in fact i think i might take it to church with me soon once i get my bibles and references loaded all in all a nice little device just not worthy of five stars i dont think,easy to handle but screen not bright enough
1.0,bought a kindle ereader christmas 2011 it is dead in april 2015 considering what paid for it it is not worth the price kindle customer service could not help i have had phones and computers last longer than this when i tried to get help the end result was to offer me expensive replacements,bought a kindle ereader christmas 2011 it is dead 
2.0,so disapointed with this new kindle especially as i had pre ordered it before the release in october i especially wanted one that i could use to read in the sun which it does perfectly no problem but reading in bed or the dark is a big no go as there is no back lighthaving only ever owned one kindle before i automatically thought this was a regular feature and nothing in the blurb said otherwise when i ordered it so thumbs down for kindle not enough explanation and not enough thought in the design process,huge disappointment
4.0,i have to be honest i wasnt so thrilled with it when i first got it it was a gift for my husband who has a fire but this one was on sale so i thought we would try it out it doesnt have a light its very basic but what i do love about it is that it feels like youre reading a book the background of the page is the color of a page in a book ive grown to like it alot and if youre looking for a basic kindle then this is a great one enjoy,its like reading a paperbook
1.0,can not load books,one star

5.0,wow this is so much better than my original kindle touch the updated software with goodreads ability to get summary information on books and improved xray just make this a terrific bargain you can even touch the name of a character and it tells you who that person is i prefer to read with a light shining on the reader rather than having a lighted display so this is just perfect for me the fonts are nice and crisp and absolutely excellent i know that some of the more expensive models have better specifications or more dots per inch dpi for fonts but this one is just excellent and again much better than the original kindle also the processor speedup makes a difference i would certainly recommend it to anyone unless they just have to have the backlight featureonly one thing you need to be aware of if you have a snap on cover for the older kindle touch it wont work on this model you will need to purchase a new one also this model has the magnetic power feature so if you buy a cover with the magnets you turn the kindle on just by opening the cover and turn it off by just closing it,impressive kindle  wow describes it pretty well
5.0,i have 5 kindle readers from keyboard to 89 fire this is my go to reader it is light glare free lasts a long time without charging this to me is the best kindle ever made i would firmly recommend this product to any dedicated reader i go nowhere without it,best ever
3.0,i had it on the charger for 4 days after i received it it never charged or woke up did multiple hard resets finally when i had all but given up a hard reset did the trick and i was able to do setup and actually use it last 2 weeks it has been wonderful no problems or issues,last 2 weeks it has been wonderful no problems or issues
3.0,im much happier with this kindle than i expected to be however i miss the automatic downloads of my nytimes subscription that i had with my old kindle just from being online now it is a multiplestep process go online select download from the cloud maybe there is a way to fix this but i havent figured it out yet,better than expected but still prefer my old one
5.0,love my new kindle the screen is beautiful and looks just like ink on paper i changed the font and word size to just where i like it it is so light and thin free prime borrowing is awesome and so many great cheap books in the library battery life is ridiculous dont know why i waited so long cant wait to lay on the beach with it,i love it
5.0,i lost my wayold kindle in the process of changing my living situation i saw this deal and decided id never get a current generation kindle brand new the price was great 64 to my surprise it turned out to have a touch screen its the perfect size so easy to use and so fast the font choices have really been improved im one who likes to get as many words as possible on the screen the new set up is very flexible so far the only snag has been finding a cover and light it definitely needs external light to be readable not to worry the device itself gives you options on the covers and lights that will work im very satisfied with this purchase have been using for 3 weeks,so worth buying
1.0,didnt work,one star
5.0,i purchased this one because i didnt use all the bells and whistles that come with the kindle fire plus this battery last weeks as compared to only hours with the fire only thing that did bother me was this one not having a backlight i shouldnt have to pay 5000 more for one but i love how light it is as compared to the first gen keyboard kindle the ergonomics of it are excellent i highly recommend this productalsothankyou amazon for still giving me the sale price,but i love how light it is as compared to the first 
1.0,hard to see,one star
5.0,takes some getting used to from my old kindle i love the smaller size and the fact that i dont have to push a button to turn the page and since i already had a light that actually fits perfectly onto the edge i can see to read at night without a bedside lamp on love it although i wish it had been easier to transfer content from my old one to this one and wish it stayed charged longer although it hold a charge longer than my kindle fire does will need to upgrade that one soon,small and handy
1.0,works great,one star
3.0,the kindle holds the lions share of ebook capital and i decided to switch to ebooks about a month ago i chose this kindle because it was on sale for black friday i love the convenience of the ebooks but im slightly disappointed with the actual devicefor what you pay here you get the bare bones plus the pleasure of viewing ads when youre not in the middle of a book its fine by me because you only need the ui really when selecting a new book to read which happens about once or twice a week for me amounting to about ten minutes a month with a little book or shoe ad wedged in the bottom corner the touchscreen which i thought would annoy me is actually very nice and i have seen no need for physical buttons to tun pagesthe kindle is a great ecosystem lots of books at fair prices and plenty of distribution options but it gets 3 stars from me due to its shortcomings regarding the hardware no this device doesnt come with a light but thats clearly marked so i knew i wasnt going to get the light however i think its silly to pay an extra 50 or so for the paperwhite the model above this that is backlit for what amounts to a cheap weak flashlight i know there are other benefits higher pixel density maybe its a little lighter but those changes shouldnt cost so much moreone other thing to note this device is a little heavier than i thought it would be its not uncomfortable by any means but its worth noting here its also a little slippery i would suggest buying a case for it amazon has a lot of cases available for 10,mediocre device great ecosystem
1.0,i bought this for my daughter for when we travel it is horrible i am quite frankly surprised by the positive reviews it is so dark that even with good illumination it hurts your eyes is is old looking the software is horrible slow dated and obsolete in the looks and and the functionality i bought books and tried to upload them on the new kindle and it would not let me it looks like a device sold in the eighties how it is even possible this thing is sold and it has positive reviews its beyond me the darkness of the screen is the most upsetting thing horrible object and upsetting buy,it is horrible i am quite frankly surprised by the positive 
5.0,i am extremely pleased with this purchase this is the 3rd kindle i have and have not had any problems with them this is small and light enough to hold in one hand without compromising its reading quality the print is easy to see with the option of changing the font it is truly glare free as i have enjoyed reading outside on these sunny days,another great kindle purchase
3.0,no backlight returning,three stars
1.0,i ordered the kindle fire and received the kindle6 in i am not happy at all since i was charged for the kindle firewhen will this be resolved also what happened to two day guarantee that didnt happen eitherplease respond as soon as possible,kindle
5.0,very good,five stars
3.0,it does not have a light to use when it is dark,three stars
1.0,too dark cant see text clearly enough,one star
1.0,this touch kindle is clunky and heavier i got it as a gift and its still in the box it doesnt have the rubber backing i am used to that makes it easier to hold especially in bed it is plasticky all over and looks cheap i just dont understand the thinking behind its design i use my kindle for reading books nothing more i just want it as small and as light as possible,please bring back the 6 e ink display previous generation 5th kindle with buttons on the side
5.0,upgraded from a kindle keyboard when this was on special for 59 or 1180mo for 5 mos took the special offer option and its not really noticeable the kindle touch 7 is fast and the features like dictionary are much nicer than the older modelalso ordered the elsse for kindle 7th gen 6 glarefree touchscreen display folio case cover it seems like a nice inexpensive case but i might go for the acasetm leather case for kindle paperwhite and kindle touch if doing it over i have an acase for the keyboard model that is 5 years old and looks like newanyway i would highly recommend the new touchscreen kindle i think its easier to use and much fasterthere seem to be many reviews by folks that expected backlights color or other features that are not really found on a dedicated reader like this they dont seem to have read the product description very well they may need a fire or another tablet deviceafter using this for several days i like it more and more,upgraded from a kindle keyboard and really like it
5.0,i sat on my old glare free kindle so needed to replace it i am so happy i did i got a good sale price pretty fast shipping since it was free and i like the updates it feels a little lighter and i love the touch screen over pushing the buttons even though there are fancy tablets out there i like reading the glare free screen as it just seems easier on my eyes i would recommend this e reader,an updated replacement
5.0,since i am such a big kindle fan when i saw this one i thought it would make a great gift for someone in the family i love the fact that i can take my entire library with me anywhere i go without breaking my back carrying all those books this kindle is easy to use and the glare free screen makes it easy to read outside or in bright light the screen is clear and whether it is a pdf file or a kindle book it is easy to navigate through the book overall i think this is a nice basic kindle for someone who doesnt need all the bells and whistles that come with the fire editions,another kindle to add to the collection
1.0,this is the second kindle i have had i smashed the first one because it refused to respond to my directions this replacement is equally annoying by shutting itself off on its own i would gladly tell anyone who asked that your product is a piece of s now the damn thing has quit working altogether can you send me the address to ship it to so someone can shove it where the sun dont shine,dont even think of buying this product
5.0,im happy with it so far the battery lasts long it isnt glitchy i had a jailbroken nook 1st gen for about 3 years and that is starting to need a reboot every 2 hours of activitythanks to calibre and send to kindle im able to get all of my files in the palm of my hand,solid ereader
5.0,i want to open the box but i cant its for my girlfriend for christmas do you think she would get mad if i open it and make sure that the case that i bought fits thank you for being quick to deliver i bet she will love it,awesome
5.0,i received this as a gift as an upgrade i previously had this kindle keyboard which i liked but i didnt use the keyboard often and it was just in the way this kinde is absolutely perfect and so comfortable to hold,which i liked but i didnt use the keyboard often and 
1.0,returned this,one star
4.0,the screen is a little too sensitive it does not take much to for the header to appear as is the case of other features i do not like the fact that advertisements for other book deals and kindle covers are on the screenother than that i like it,too sensitive
1.0,i have the paperwhite as my primary device i ordered the base price kindle as a second device for my family i now discover that i cant control the brightness i like to read at night as does my wife we cant read this kindle with lights out…definitely a deal breaker in my opinion i will request return authorization avoid this subpar basic kindle,i like to read at night
4.0,this is a great little piece of technology perfect for reading on the go it allows you to take your library wherever you go built in wifi means this model is more economical than those with built in 3g4g connectivity but for many users myself included the wifi alone is sufficientits compact size means that it travels easily the glare free screen means reading without eye strain if you read a great deal then the kindle is just what you needmany classic works of literature are free or at very little cost so you can stock up on great books for nothing or close to it,library on the go
1.0,can not read books that i purchased on device and on desktop,too restrictive too much of a follower
5.0,i had an older keyboard style kindle for years and it came up missing we looked everywhere for it and figured id lost in while traveling so i finally decided to pick up this new kindle i really like its size and light weight and i think the screen has higher contrast and is easier for me to read so about a week after receiving it guess what i found the older kindle in the zippered pocket in a bag right where id put it so now i have two i have a case for the older one with a light so i use that at home in bed ill be taking the newer one with me when i travel for its form factor i love how all my content is linked together so i can read on my cell phone computer or either kindle ps we love our echo too alexa is becoming a member of the family,great form factor and utility
1.0,im so upset about this device its black and white no colors at all as i need colored pictures for the books i use tutorials and encyclopedias its useless without color it wasnt mentioned anywhere in the description that its black and white only on the specifications page if you open it separately which i didnt when i was ordering it i would never buy it knowing it has no colors i assumed that in 21 century everything is colored and the books come in their original form im returning it very disappointed,no colors
3.0,l like it but i miss the texttospeech feature which i often use in the car and the remove from device feature i dont care to look at titles ive already read deleted a book on my computer it still shows up on my screen even after a restartin settings you can get rid of all the advertising hallelujahi have had a 2nd generation since 2009 really like it but the battery is not holding a charge very well anymore ill keep it anywaywould like a new battery,i like it but
1.0,hard to read,one star
5.0,just got it today and i really like it so far eink does take a bit to get used to if youre used to reading on a back lit led screen its not like reading on my laptop tablet or my wifes kindle fire it is actually like reading a printed page its off white color is more like reading a newspaper page than a book to me but my eyes are really telling the difference i can read longer on this device with less eyestrain i am blind in one eye so i needed something like this devicei also love that fact that it doesnt have distractions like push notifications and all the other distractions that come along with using a fire or tablet its just a plain reader just what i was looking foreasy to set up has step by step instructions when you turn on the device wifi setup was a breeze i was off and going reading my first book in about 2 minutes all my books easily downloaded from the cloudi like that its small and lightweight easy to hold in one hand and turn pages with the touchscreen and the special offer ads are not intrusive wish the ads were more relevant to my interests thoughthe only thing i wish it had was a longer usb cable and a ac charger but i can find those pretty cheapnow to find a cover at a reasonable price with a book light,excellent product eink screen is great for bad eyes
1.0,no backlight,one star
4.0,easy ti use,i like it
1.0,i owned a kindle fire piece of crap will not even make a good boat anchor the books i had installed on it were difficult to find a certain page or chapter take it back it is impossible to find a particular page or chapter without scrolling through all pages until you find it i do not purchase any books that have to be read through kindle not even the free ones,not even a good boat anchor
4.0,this is a great device which i bought as an alternative to reading on my hdx i love it and can read for hours with no eyestrain whatsoever my one gripe is the claim that it gets weeks on a single charge not true after a day its down a quarter,this is a great device which i bought as an alternative to reading 
5.0,picked this up at a local big box store on feb 23rd only had it a couple of days but im loving it upgraded from kindle 2nd gen that had started acting up after several years and a second battery this new kindle has the same 167 ppi as the 2nd gen but the difference in clarity in the screens is amazing the grey background is lighter on the new one the black text is darkerricher and the contrast is more crisp making the text more clear i love the touch screen so much easier to navigate access the dictionary etc for those who just want a reader it is definitely a comfortable lightweight easy to use affordable option the ads on the 80 version are no more intrusive than the pictures on the screen saver of the older kindles its just a picture that comes up when the unit is left idle usually of a book for sale on amazon not scrolling ads like on computersgames etc so paying an extra 20 not to have them is a waste of money in my opinion hoping this little one holds up as well and as long as my original one did,if you just want a reader this is the one to buy
3.0,grandson loves it,three stars
5.0,i just added this to our collection of kindles i have a k2 and my wife has a kindle keyboard i especially like the xray feature for looking up characters in the books i often forget who someone is if they have not been mentioned for awhile this kindle has a far superior display compared to my k2 and perhaps a bit better than the kindle keyboard the pages turn much faster than either of the older models that we have and it is lighter too there is no audio like my older kindles have but honesty we never used that feature anyway from what i have read the battery life isnt as good but thats not an issue for us as we are retired and use our kindles primarily indoors so an outlet is almost always available,great
1.0,after 4 years my nook started giving me trouble so i decided to give the kindle a try but mistake i had a hard time reading in a well lit room it is way too dark plus it just feels and looks cheap i will stick with the nook which i believe to be a superior product the worst part is that i have to pay to send this piece of junk back,piece of junk
4.0,the kindle is true to its product descriptions as the description and many other reviewers have stated it has no backlight thats fine however its still much darker than i feel it ought to be at very first i thought i was being stupid with my mental complaints but then i placed my kindle next to a book page and there was a massive difference the issue is that the kindle background isnt white its gray so theres not a lot of contrast i suppose thats what makes the kindle paperwhite so attractive thoughthe other thing that is disappointing about the kindle is that whenever you turn a page or do anything with it theres a moment of glitches while the page changes its almost a split second but it happens every time id expected it to be a bit smoother than thatother than those small complaints i do like my new kindle the extra features are really what makes this device a worthwhile purchaseedit i received my kindle just this past friday i charged it fully then proceeded to use it since then its been five days the battery is halfway down i dont know if i just read more than other kindle users i dont think i do but the description says that the battery lasts weeks at the rate its going my kindle will need a recharge in just ten days which is technically not weeks its days obviously thats disappointing to me and i did dock my review by one star but its still a good battery life for a device,mostly satisfied
3.0,i returned the kindle never used this,three stars
5.0,i recently purchased a new glare proof kindle and im very happy with it its super light weight and the glare proof screen is amazing the lighter weight is a blessing since the arthritis is becoming worse in my hands and arms i can hold my new kindle for hours without any pain also i love to read outside and i will be doing a lot of that this summer with my new kindle,fun in the sun with my new kindle
1.0,part of the problem was that i believed i was getting the kindle with the back lit screen the issue is with staples and not amazon this kindle was ok for 4900 it is hard to move around on the screen i am unable to scroll through the chapter list because every time i try to scroll it just jumps to a different spot from the opening screen it show the last three book title on top of screen and sale items on the bottom of the screen if you are not quick and accurate with your finger you got stuck to a sale screeni kept the box and will just give this kindle away to some body or maybe good will it is not worth the hassle hopefully the kindle with the back lit screen wont have the same issues,the wrong kindle
4.0,not a lot to say here that isnt pretty subjective i wanted a reader that has a good screen this one is clear and very readable could have a little better contrast is light its lighter than most books but heavier than i expected and has good battery life probably better if i could remember to turn off the wifi after i download something i did not want a reader with more features i could do without the occasional blackwhiteblack flicker when you turn pages and i dont get the impression that this simple plastic device is worth a hundred dollars in its seventh generation the basic kindle is good but could be better for the money imho,capable too expensive
1.0,i returned this item i did not like that it didnt have color in the screen only black and white my husband ordered it for me so i didnt know until it arrived what the details were concerning this device,i did not like that it didnt have color in the screen
4.0,this is exactly what i expected from the product description so i am almost but not quite perfectly happy with it this is a little thing but while you can put it in landscape mode it only does it with the fat part of the bezel on the lefthand side this is really annoying if you want to use your left hand for anything other than holding the kindle as might be the case if you are left handed i cant imagine that it would be that hard to let you flip the display for lefties one star demerit for dexter chauvinism,great with one annoying flaw for lefties
1.0,difficult to navigate sent it back,one star
5.0,i love my kindle i love the fact that it can judge your reading time and then let you know how many minutes are left in each chapter my biggest frustration with my old kindle one of the earliest models was that i never knew how long a chapter was now i can gauge how long each chapter will take me and i dont have to worry that i will have to stop reading in the middle of a chapter plus it is very lightweight and is perfect for reading out in the sun,i love my kindle
4.0,arrived on time,four stars
1.0,its ok but the touch screen freezes sometime and its difficult to hold the kindle lying downif accidentally which happens a lot your fingers touches the screen the font changeswhich is very disturbingi would recommend people not to buy it,i would recommend people not to buy
1.0,sorry i didnt get the paper white,one star
5.0,for those who do not have wifi  you should know that wifi is not absolutely necessary in order to use this kindle you will need to go to a starbucks or other venue that offers free wifi only once and that is in order to register your new kindle once youve done that you no longer need wifithis is what you can do1 buy a kindle book which will then be in your library2 use the usb cable included to hook your kindle to your computer3 go to your library and click on download4 your book will be downloaded into your computers downloads folder5 click on the start menu and then computer6 find the kindle icon and open it7 in your downloads folder right click on the kindle book and choose send to kindle8 drag the kindle file into the kindles documents folder9 your kindle book will now be installed on your kindlethis kindle is so lightweight and easy to use setup is easy and the touchscreen is convenient for the money i think this kindle rates 5 stars,wifi is not absolutely necessary
1.0,it must have inbuilt light in it,one star
5.0,me encanta,five stars
3.0,i love the kindle device i really do but im just not really all that happy with this version i prefer the way my old kindle touch was made i dont like the material it is made out of now it shows fingerprints not on the screen only on the black part which drives my ocd crazy also the inside edge of it where the black surrounding part meets the screen has a dip which collects dust or hair this drives me nuts i use my kindle daily because i love to read so much i love the kindle allows me to do that i just love my old one so much more because it didnt have either of these issues i find i am constantly picking out hair bits of fuzz or teeny crumbs out of the little edge what annoys me more is that when i do this i have to make sure im not actually reading or i will accidentally turn the page 10 times by touching the screen so i just try to blow the little nasties away which isnt very effective its just annoying i was so excited to be getting the newer version and i expected to love it just as much as my old kindle touch im not sure if the paperwhite is made the same way or not if it is and i had gone ahead and purchased that one like i was considering i would be really upset,like my old one better 
5.0,awesome i love this kindle great for reading which is why i got it no complaints here except that i like reading so much that i probably should have gotten the paperwhite but i guess i can just turn a light on with the regular kindle,awesome sauce
1.0,i returned very hard to read with no back lght,one star
4.0,not quite a replacement for a book but offers convenience that books do not this kindle provides an acceptable reading experience it also provides the convenience of being able to carry many volumes of books with you what it gives up in terms of reading experience it makes up for in conveniencei have not had any problems with it the battery lasts a very long time my unit has the sponsored advertisements but they have not bothered me i contemplated getting the mobile broadband version but the price differential was more than i cared to pay i am usually located near a wifi access point so it has not caused me any problemshighly recommended for those who plan to stay close to a wifi access point,acceptable reading experience
2.0,the product itself is fine and i enjoy reading from it my problem however is that i am forced to purchase from amazon in the usa as against amazon uk generally speaking the usa price of a specific book is 3 to 4 times the price of the same book from the uk site often at us dollar prices i could go and buy the paperback edition brand new off the shelf here in south africa i could then lend it to half a dozen people and thereafter donate it to the local library where another 10 people could read it i cannot afford to use the kindle here i think i will give it to my brother in the uk,south africans beware
5.0,i last owned a kindle 2nd generation so this was quite an updatefor one the screen refreshes significantly faster than previous models the crisp eink display is easy to read and when using features like the onscreen keyboard etc the fast refresh makes it much nicer to usethe other feature i really enjoy is the touchscreen coming from the 2nd gen with its keyboard and 5d stick navigation the touchscreen is so much more intuitive and simple to usereally i cant complain about this device at all eink readers have really come a long way and they are hard to beatpros fast screen refresh easy on the eyes touchscreen navigation and operation is intuitivecons none im reviewing this device for what it isnot what it is not if you want a lit kindle they make themits called the kindle paperwhite dont knock this device for not being a different model people,works as advertised easy to use what more could you ask for
2.0,needs back light cant read in darker areas,hmm
4.0,love my new kindle i had been holding onto my fiancees original keyboard model for as long as possible when a software issue rendered it useless i was able to work with customer support to get an upgrade at a great price and my own so i wasnt hijacking hers overall no complaintsfurther i was told that my case from the keyboard version wouldnt fit this model however i have found that it works great and i havent had any issues at all,great upgrade from the keyboard version 1st or 2nd gen
5.0,outstanding product,five stars
5.0,dear amazonthank you for you help and for always answering questionsyou do good business i appreciate you taking your customers first i love my new kindle and have figured it out and found network password in my previous notes kept my old kindle was so much simpler and i wasnt prepared for such advancementsnow after my reading and spending time with it i am delighted and loving it thank you again for being there for your customersnez,learning new kindle
2.0,it really is small,two stars
5.0,i love this basic model i dont need a built in light this screen has bolder text than paperwhite and voyage i love bold text the background is light gray i like light graythere is less glare than a white background you only have to tap the screen to turn the page simple no areas to accidentally touch at the bottom there is a bigger area to hold onto i like that the dictionary feature is much more positive than reading on a tablet on a tablet it cant make up its mind whether you want the dictionary or the settings window i can use it one handedeither hand it fits in my shirt pocket i like that its sooo much lighter than a tableti have chosen to use it without a case just a sleeve type that also holds the chargerwithout a doubt this is the best designed kindle touch since it is this much fun i plan to buy a second one im afraid the next generation basic model wont be this great sometimes change is not good if you dont want a built in light you may discover this is the one for you also,the best of the kindles
3.0,needs a back light,three stars
2.0,used to own a keyboard kindle and it finally stopped working this one is not as comfortable to hold and the screen is definitely not glarefree i am using the same light to read by as my old kindle but constantly have to adjust the position because of the glare,not glarefree
1.0,this particular kindle is what it is it would have been great if someone would have thought of putting either a brightness screen or some kind of light within the kindle it is useless at night when one is trying to read while in bed you need to have a mini light attached to it or have a lamp on unhappy,it would have been great if someone would have thought of putting either a 
5.0,a new technology from past kindles but once i got used to it am very very pleasedlots of free books from amazoncom and our local library has a reasonably good collection of books to read in kindle format,good deal reasonable price fast delivery
3.0,browser is not ok,three stars
5.0,i love my kindle dearly i have resisted buying a kindle for years being a paper only kind of guy but this device is wonderful it does a fantastic job of giving wonderful technology helps while making you feel you are still reading a paper book it does not have a back light but to be honest i dont find myself reading in he dark very oftenpros books are cheaper take notes easier while reading find definitions of words in seconds having hundreds of books on hand any timecons no back light,wonderful technology while still feeling like you are reading a paper back book
3.0,hard to turn off,three stars
4.0,good but no sound,four stars
1.0,i can only get it to bringup the old testament am unable to retrieve the new testament or move from chapter too chapter it is not taking commands well will not enlarge fonts on request im feeling like i made an expensive mistake in this item could be it just cant do what i need thank you g ggary mccombs,im feeling like i made an expensive mistake in this item could 
1.0,i am extremely disappointed in my 2 year old kindle suddenly ti lost connection to my wifi on it the wifi works on our 2 laptops and a kindle fire two years on a product that my son saved his money to purchase this for me is a shame it was not used frequently i called tech support and was on the phone for about 2 hours the enjoyment of having a book displayed instantly is a 5 star unfortunately the longevity is a 0 star thus my low rating,i am extremely disappointed in my 2 year old kindle
4.0,my new kindle is charging im assuming itll work just fine heres my gripe its absolutely absurd that kindles dont come with the wall charger its like buying a can of chicken noodle soup that doesnt come with the chicken brilliant guess what amazon nice try but you had to know i would do my homework find a cheaper alternative to the 20 wall charger yall market for the kindles psa go to cable matters get it there,yay but
3.0,upgraders beware there is no text to speech feature,no text to speech feature
3.0,it takes getting used to you have great ability to read in bed at nightwhich establishes a bad habit  wince it no longer archives booksand you have no ability to listen to audiobooks on this one it is also not as friendly at the gym you have to swipe the screen which means sweaty fingers wiping the screen nasty before i would set it to a larger font and read on the ellipticali must have read hundredsand just pressed the right or left hand button so easy but once you get used to it it is good i have had some problems where it literally locks up in that case i have to reset it that is really aggravating,you have great ability to read in bed at night
2.0,just not good enough,two stars
4.0,love this kindlegot it as a gift when my old kindle keyboard finally stopped working after years of faithful use i thought id hate the touchscreen but its actually not that bad very easy to use however i feel like the screen is a little smaller than my old one that might be an illusion due to there not being a keyboard so the actual device is smaller it is the special offers version meaning that it shows ads when it is in sleep mode i think i would like this better if the ads were geared towards me and my buyingbrowsing habits and not just random items it made the device 20 bucks cheaper so im not really complaining black casing shows fingerprints and smudges pretty bad so i got a case which i love by marblue vassen when on the home screen it doesnt show the current book that i am reading on the first page it puts it on the last page of my books so i have to scroll through it find it which is the only reason i did not give this kindle 5 stars,love this kindle
3.0,was not bright enough,three stars
4.0,i bought this to replace my previous kindle with keyboard after its screen froze i am actually addicted to my kindle this one has about the same size screen the text is sharper and i like that you can change the font type not just the size of the font,replacement kindle
2.0,too small of a screen,two stars
5.0,was really impressed this being my first kindle took it outside and enjoyed being able to read it with the surrounding brightness could have used some sort of first time instruction sheet included wasnt sure i was downloading correctly but figured it out and was ok with my first book cured my problem of getting to many bound books would recommend to anybody,excellent product at a reasonable price
5.0,my daughter loves it,five stars
5.0,i didnt ever think i would own a kindlei love the way books feel and smell but its so easy to pack in your satchel purse or backpackits light and easy to manage also i would recommend buying the reading lightthis is a good starter outer to see if you will like the kindle and use itenjoy if you are thinking about buying a kindle i would say go for the top of the line if you can afford it,kindle 6
1.0,has no back lighting,one star
5.0,i like my new kindle took it to the beach and read it right in the sun no glare what so evertouch screen allowed for smaller dimensions which is cool as well wifi feature works extremely well and easy to set updevice recognized me as the owner and synced my books in one minutethe only point to make cover is a nice touch but burgundy came as pink,very satisfied
1.0,not impressed at all waste of the ads kill itand of course there is no light nothing like your child reading a book on here when an ad for 50 shades of gray pops up this device reminds me of something from 1980,waste of 
5.0,what can i say its a kindle e reader cant ask for more we both traded in 3rd gen key board kindles so total cost after kindle trade in special deal was only 3450 each glad we took advantage of the deal of course we added extra for new cases but the old ones were 5 years old and showing wear nice part is the old chargers are still useable and due to long battery life they dont get used much so should last a lot longer,this deserves six stars
1.0,i purchased the kindle today 71515 and received it the same day excited to use the kindle i opened the box and there it was with the screen showing a picture of the kindle itself and an arrow pointing to the power button with several different languages saying power on i charged it and they proceeded to turn on the kindle but it did not turn on i checked the user manuals on the amazon website and nothing helped me i am planning to return it and hopefully receive a device that is working,expected a working refurbished kindle not a broken refurbished kindle
4.0,this is my first kindle and ive had it for several months now time to have read a number of books on it its definitely a big plus for traveling when space and weight are considerations there are so many reviews on this model already that i dont really have much to add that would be useful but my wife has the paperwhite version which is her 2nd kindle her first being an much bulkier early model i have to say that i wish id gotten that instead,good but better is available
4.0,works great no problems whatsoever i have several other readers but for someone that wants to purchase just one to solely read on id spend a few extra bucks and go with the paperwhite well worth the extra to be able to read at any time with the back light ive never had a better reader this one is great if you dont want to spend a lot and would use it mainly in the daylight or with the lights on at night ,nice reader for the price 
5.0,great reading device i bough it because i wanted a place to have my books and take my library everywhere i want it feels like reading a book no glare and no back light it takes some time to get used to but once you get used to it but it is fantastic i am reading more than before thanks to this device battery last for a week i wanted a kindle fire pro but for a reason that i dont know amazon does not ship fire pros to puerto rico so i finished buying this device but is good,great reading device
5.0,weve used all sorts of tablets but not a kindle so we tried the least expensive one when it was on sale i have to say i really like it even though its the cheapest option its fairly easy to use easy to read in the light and extremely light its something we can take with us wherever and you never have to worry about storage or battery life would recommend a kindle to anyone who even marginally likes to read travels etc,perfect for any type of reader
3.0,it has to many features,features can be annoying
4.0,i really like this product i can take it anywhere with me i small enough to put into my bag and light enough that i barely know its there super convenient to take on flights or road trips i wish it had a builtin light so that i can read it when it gets dark out i need a flashlight to see overall i am very satisfied with this product it is also very durable im very careful with my valuables but accidents do happen and it had hit the floor twice tile and it didnt do any damage very pleased with that as well where with an ipad it would have been damaged,i enjoy it very much
2.0,didnt have a backlight,two stars
5.0,it was given to me by my son and i love it i never thought id enjoy not having a book in my hand but i can hardly put my kindle down so manybooks to choose from and are instantly added to my kindle,kindle gift is so appreciated
3.0,i still cant get it working optimally must keep trying,three stars
3.0,i prefer my chromebook since its color has email and web while light and enough battery for use around the house unplugged the keyboard acts as a nice prop for reading in bed on the couch or at a tableso i bought the kindle for outside the house where the superlong battery life is required backpacking and international travelwhat i dont like about kindle is that books i have checked out from my local public library cant be returned when finished or unfinished if ive decided i dont want to read it and they count against my limit at the library so i cant check out something new until the 3 week lending period expiresi also dont like that i cant read the economist a news magazine i pay for using their app on my chromebook and the kindle i have to choose between the two devices and it costs more on the kindle and is in black and white so i read it on my chromebook which is fine most of the time except when traveling when the longer battery life would be make kindle a better choice,best outdoors or when traveling
1.0,my kindle a slightly older version quit half the screen wont display it was barely used three books amazon wont help me so think about this when you consider buying a kindle whatever titles you acquire will eventually become useless when the device fails and the company no longer supports the product heres what a kindle is good for it makes a fine bookmark in a real book that will last decades,crap product failed but amazon customer service is the real problem
5.0,this is a very basic ereader which is exactly what i wanted to go with my kindle firei use in bright daylight as there is no glare and can read when my fire is charging my generation 2 kindle died and i had been using it as mentioned after a week i decided i wanted this backup very affordable works great as simply an ereader,kindle basic reader
3.0,i love amazon i love my kindle why would they use this marketing tactici purchased the most basic kindle and have loved it ever since it failed after the warranty period i was on the chat with a rep and she kindly offered because we care for our customers i can offer you one at a highly discounted rate i would have taken that blindly but guess what i feel the marketing tacting uxed to upsell me is not the ideal customer service we are accostumed to i just want the same basic i have or an equivalent i can buy it new for 75 on your site we are sorry sir those are not an option for replacement but you can buy a fire for 300 or a paperwhite for 150 which are a great value yes great value but i bought a basic and that is what i want i find that you should not offer a highly discounted rate if you are not willing to do it for an equicalent product just say were really sorry it is out of the warranty,not the amazon i know
4.0,fortunately i bought this as a back up for my paperwhite when the battery needs recharging and i want to continue reading while it charges i did not realize it was not lighted which has already been a problem for me when i was trying to read at night in a car otherwise it does what i need the extended battery life is for reading 30 minutes a day so it doesnt last weeks but in airplane mode it does last a good amount of time as does the paperwhite,didnt notice it lacked a built in adjustable light like the paperwhite
2.0,replaced my 2nd broken kindle with this item unhappy that it doesnt have the same capabilities as my older versions i mainly use my kindle for reading but occasionally i like to play a few games when i downloaded this kindle with my previously items i couldnt find any of my games only to learn that this newer model doesnt support the game apps it would have been nice to know that before i purchased this this will be the last kindle i purchase,newer is not better
5.0,i love the kindle seriously i love it first of all it is great for keeping me focused on my reading because there is only the option of reading i always read on my kindle instead of my ipad because of 5 reasons1 the kindle has the backlight so there isnt glare making it very easy for me to read books even at the beach the ipad not so much2 its so light the ipad is very heavy but this fits in my purse backpack you name it3 free books a christmas carol for example my brother and sister read it over holiday break4 its so easy to change the settings on the kindle they offer about 8 different fonts brightness level and shows how many more minutes in the chapter5 through the public elibrary i can download books from the huge elibrary database onto my kindle and rent them for up to 3 weeks it is so useful its just like the regular library downloads within seconds onto my kindle perfect know other products do this but it is so useful i love the kindle definitely recommend it,everything i love about this kindle
1.0,not pleased w purchase,one star
5.0,i am writing this from the perspective of being a longtime experienced kindle user vs someone brand new from an overall perspective considering the pricing of the kindle with special offers at 79 vs higher amounts for the different flavors of kindle available today this one is a bargain if you have wanted to get your kids a kindle to encourage reading as well as sharing of books but hesitated because 119 to 400 is a lot of money to risk with a child maybe at 79 this is your price pointfrom a size standpoint the reading screen is the exact same size as the other eink kindles it is slightly thicker but slightly lighter than the kindle paperwhite but to me its not really a noticeable difference when youre holding it in a protective coveropening up the box included with the kindle is a microusb cord but no power adapter thats really annoying interestingly and it seems rather chicken of amazon a power adaptor has to be purchased separately for 15 if you purchase it at the same time as you purchase the kindle or 20 if you purchase it later so if you already have a microusb charger handy i wouldnt order one of the chargersthere are no page buttons no buttons at all except for the power button and turning the page is as easy as tapping the side of the screen with your thumb while youre reading or swiping the screen with your fingerreading is easy on this one in comparison to my kindle keyboard the previous version of kindle and a kindle dx the letters on the screen are much much darker and easier to read the display is crisp and dark,i love it
2.0,not as good as nook i will never buy other kindle,two stars
2.0,i purchased this new kindle to replace my old kindle gen 2 or 3 because that one was having black screen issues and getting stuck when paging forwardmistake this new kindle is so frustrating i dislike that my items are on the cloud i dislike that if i move a book to a collection it still shows up in recent and it doesnt show me the entire description of the name of the book that would include the book number in the seriesi was willing to deal with the ads the no wifi but when im connected and trying to move my read books to read booksnope it duplicates the effortthe touch screen isnt conducive to a left hand page turneroverall i wish i hadnt purchased this kindle ive fought using my galaxy s tablet for reading but i guess ill have to suck it up this kindle isnt gong to work,should have read the negative reviews first
4.0,its good for children,four stars
3.0,simple no impressive,three stars
3.0,its easy to read but every few pages it goes to a page where it says kindle is restarting or something like that i then have to wait about 40 seconds for it to do its thing then it takes me to a page thats about fifteen pages before the page i was on so i have to keep tapping on the screen to get up to where i was in addtion theres no page number listed i may go back to regular books,keeps leaving page and restarting
5.0,love this kindle i have problem with dry eyes and reading makes that worse especially with the newer computer screens but this kindle is just like reading a real paper book and easy on the eyes i love i can adjust the print bigger so reading is a breeze i would definitely recommend for reading books for pleasure but i would not recommend for books with pictures or reference books that you need to be referring back and forth i had ordered a book with a lot of diagrams and they were hard to see so i ended up ordering the hardcover edition,love this kindle
1.0,probably my fault i didnt realize i was ordering just a reader i wanted the same kind of kindle i was replacing still havent figured this one out and not crazy about the bkack and white either i feel like i wasted 9900 ,not happy
5.0,love it wasnt sure id like swiping to turn the page but im so used to it from my ipad that it took about 2 seconds to be glad the buttons were gone i really prefer the screen with no backlight for reading especially at the beach i was one of those people who said oh ill always be a real book person and looking back i think how ridiculous the kindle is so much better for someone who goes through lots of books i just wish my local library got with the program and spent more on digital loans as opposed to paper books cds and desktop computers,third kindle still better
1.0,im looking at replacing my kindle but i dont like the touch screen i will not replace mine until buttons are available again if it takes too long and the one i have now breaks first maybe i can overcome my book addiction and get a life,im looking at replacing my kindle but i dont like the touch screen
5.0,since it was on sale 59 i had to get itthe best part about it probably the battery life aside from the price it seems to last foreverive tried to read books on a laptop tablet and a smartphone before and i often get eye strain from staring at the screen or get easily distracted with the kindle this is not a problem the experience feels like reading a real book and you dont have text messages emails or push notifications bothering youi like touch interface and minimal design the interface does get some time to get used too since its not it doesnt respond immediately like a tablet or smartphone woulddigital books on amazon are more convenient to get than the physical books since i can just download them on the kindle no need to carry thick heavy books in my bag anymore the kindle is small and easily portable sometimes its cheaper to get the digital books too which makes a big incentive to get the kindle anywayi also like how i can read a book on my computer running the kindle app and then opening the same book on another device would ask me if i would like to pick up where i left off,great reading experience
1.0,cant read in the dark didnt realize that it didnt have a light not easy to use some areas underlined that i didnt initiate why wish that i could buy the original fire kindle my first second and third kindles were great i had to buy another since mine wont turn on anymore so sad also bought your tablet hardly lasts a full day worthless,not easy to use
5.0,i had been searching ebay looking for a good deal on a used kindle most of those sold at auction were selling for almost full retail of a new unit i happened upon this offer for a refurbished kindle and jumped on it received order promptly item is in perfect condition and have enjoyed reading with it for the past week love my new kindle its light small enough to handle easily and easy on the eyes this is the current version of kindle doesnt have a backlight but i do not find that to be an issue if i were reading a printed book i would need to use an external lamp to read in dim light prior to using my kindle i was reading using the kindle ap on my ipad this works great but gets a bit heavy to hold after a while and is really hard to see in bright sunlight the kindle is a perfect fit for me,refurbished kindle good buy
2.0,does not have back light,two stars
5.0,this was a significant improvement over the buttonbased model that i have been using for 2 years page flips are noticeably much faster i can read leisurely for hours on end thank you amazon,this was a significant improvement over the buttonbased model that 
2.0,no back light for reading,two stars
5.0,i love everything about it i love that i have a trillion books to choose from in my favorite genres i love that they were all free from the library or other sites the kindle weighs the same or lighter than paper books keeps my spot the charge has lasted me one full week so far and i hear that it can last up to 25 weeks with regular nightly use i love that i dont have to worry about lack of space to store my books im looking forward to sharing my books with my friends i love that i can sit anywhere in my very bright apartment where i have windows floortoceiling without a glare im looking forward to sitting on my balcony and at the beach too i cant do that with my kindle fire or my ipad or my cell phonei bought the elsse for kindle 6 glare free folio case cover for kindle 7th generation dark blue this rich quality leather cover is a perfect fit without adding a ton of weight,love
1.0,have not received product,one star
5.0,i had the 2nd generation kindle a long time ago and gave it to my mom and i upgraded to an ipad i have used the kindle app for years on my android phone on my desktop computer and now on my ipad however i noticed i was not really enjoying reading full books on my ipad partly its the distraction of all the other things pinging me facebook email etc but also the backlighting was causing eye strain so when a sale came up on the nice little pocket sized kindle i grabbed it so happy i did very light weight perfect for purse and daily train commute i was always scared to haul out my huge ipad especially with the thefts going on and i can jam through a book much faster i like the improvements they made in the navigation much easier to flip pages im delighted will enjoy this tremendously btw i got my mom a fire later but she never used it i am happier i think with this bookspecific device,why buy yet another device when the app is free heres why
3.0,neat and tidy but limited,three stars
2.0,i had a keyboard kindle for many years and am now trying to find a replacement i now use my kindle fire hd when i received this tiny little kindle it felt like a childs toy i had no trouble with registration tho it is different nor was there any glitch with transferring all content first i do not like the type of homepage you can only see a few books at a time pulling them up requires several different moves other content such as definition constantly pop up when barely hovering over a word secondly the most annoying feature in swiping a page many many times it will swipe several then going back it will swipe many more so i constantly have to be aware of the percent sign at the bottom of the page that is very interrupting to reading fluidly i am giving up and going to see about returning it it is way too much trouble something i never experienced with my kindle with buttons or my fire with swiping,not your mothers kindle
2.0,not packaging this device with a backlight is absurd if not including this feature is by design a feeble marketing attempt at good 6 entry model better paper white and best voyage then amazon has truly done its homework with its inhouse word smiths churning a ludicrous bullet point dialogue to justify this device as a practical tool to up sell the paperwhite with an included backlight as a perc garners the notion that the purchase of an automobile not equipped with headlights or windshield wipers would preclude the buyer to assume said equipment was an option on par with navigation systems sunroofs and leather trim for someone to truly embrace this nonsense would entitle cartre blanche membership of the flat earth society,marketing gaga
5.0,great basic ereader i received mine as a christmas present it is everything it is advertised to be it has 4g of memory with approximately 3g available for storage i currently have some 1200 books on mine with some 40 or so being textbooks with roughly 1200 1600 pages and another dozen or so being multi volume sets7 to 13 books per set and i still have roughly half of the available memory left1524g to be exact the lack of a light was a known factor and like some have noted a book doesnt have a light so just reading with a lamp on solves the problem or obviously it is not a problem in daylight or bright light the unit does a good job and is easy to read and operatei find i actually read more with this than with my tablet since there are no interruptions from being able to go online and do other browsing it allows me to read uninterrupted,nice basic ereader
1.0,there is now way to adjust the brightness which made it useless i exchanged it for one that you can adjust the brightness i love it,which made it useless i exchanged it for one that you can 
3.0,cant increase brightness,three stars
5.0,this is my 3rd kindle paperwhite i loved my first one then it inexplicably died i replaced it with the current model at the time which i never liked then that one died the curser wouldnt work so i couldnt pick a book etc so i was hesitant to replace it but it is a good deal better than the other model and easier to use also easier to order more books i also had the first model of the kindle fire which stopped charging which is a huge disappointment as i like the option of the light for reading at night my husband still has the first model of the kindle paperwhite and it still works great so i decided to try again,3rd times the charm
5.0,my daughter got a basic kindle 3 years ago then my son got one 2 years ago ive been using theirs they got sick of me hogging iti bought this the week before valentines for 79 then saw it was on sale for 59 a few days later i contacted amazon since the sale price was within 7 days of the delivery of my item they quickly refunded me 20 score yay amazon i love being able to tap the page to turn it very easy when i am lying in bed reading easy to navigate and figure out these seem to go on sale with anyevery holiday out there so keep an eye out if you are in the market none of our kindles have ever had a problem these are a no brainer for kids my only gripe is that while both my kids kindles were able to download some games like sudoku such this new one doesnt have that option i wonder why,love it
3.0,i thought it would do more,three stars
5.0,i purchased this even though i have a fire due to the distractions that happen while i am trying to read on my fire i purchased this on prime day since it was such a good deali have been wanting to get back to just me and my book for a while also since a good part of my day is spent outside in my yard relaxing with my kids i love the no glare easy on the eye reader i have a couple of recommendations when you purchase include an e reader booklight this little guy doesnt have a back light you can get your whole library on this and i love that all in all i am so happy with this and happy to read distraction free,love this little reader
1.0,i do not like the kindle 6,one star
5.0,i used to be an avid reader in middle and high school but the stress of college put pleasure reading as very last on my list if it ever made it at all another change was that i got an iphone my sophomore year and from then on i was proponent of consolidation and having as much as possible in one easy to access place music games email etc i think having this preference and mentality made it worse for reading as a book was just anthoer bulking thing to add to my book bag at last i asked for a kindle as a late late xmasbirthday gift and its been the best gift ive received so far my favorite part is how youre able to track your reading progress its lightweight easy to store has all the books i could ever want and theres never any chance of ruining the book i always hated and lamented ruined books finally the ease of purchasing books is the best feeling ever all in all im glad to become an avid reader once again,im an avid reader again
1.0,ugh not what was advertsed,one star
5.0,i have owned a kindle since the first ones came out i accidentally dropped my reader and needed a replacement love that i was able to pick this up on prime day at a reduced cost ive had to adapt a bit to the touchscreen but it is very much like a smartphone the screen improvements since my first one make it even easier to read like no clicking to turn the page that sound can be annoying if my husband is trying to sleep while im reading im very pleased with this kindle touchscreen i also purchased an elisse case from probiz to protect it as i travel so like not having the bulkiness of having to carry books to read,replacement kindle and its improved
3.0,not what i thought returned,three stars
4.0,owned two nooks before this one i adapted to it pretty well1 star due to the annoyance of the touch screen it can crowd you out of enjoying your novel when you accidentally touch the screen,i adapted to it pretty well 1 star due to the annoyance of 
1.0,unable to play games on it,one star
5.0,this is my sixth kindle so i was expecting a good product and thats what i got excellent product very intitive i love the instant start feature when you use cover i recommend you splurge and get the reading light it can be a little difficult to read in bed otherwise,happy reading
1.0,do not buy a kindle i bought a kindle paperwhite device to download a txt book and when i tried to purchase it i was only allowed to download it to either my android or mac device via a kindle reading app when i contacted an amazon customer support rep ryan to find out why i was told that each kindle device has limited access to only the kindle materials which each publisher allows i was outraged this is false advertising on the part of amazons marketing team which suggests to buyers that by making a purchase they will have complete access to the wide assortment of kindle compatible materials and do not overtly forewarn of the devices limitations so buyer beware if you buy a kindle product you may or may not have access to the kindle material you want to purchase digitally youre better off just downloading the free app to an alternate device and saving your money,what a rip off
5.0,greatest device ever made already paid for itself after 5 books wish i had known about this device years ago then i would have saved a whole lot of money instead of buying books that are doing nothing but sitting pretty in my bookshelf bitter sweet almost but most of all i find myself reading a kindle far easier than an actual book and this coming from a guy who loves the heavy hardcover editions too,greatest device ever made
1.0,the product doesnt work right i have a book from the library in there but it wont open unless my on the internet which i dont have and the instructions on your website says otherwise im tired of paying for something outside and then have to pay shipping and handling out of my own pocket to replace or fix it im not sure if lm going to send it back and not read anymore or give another trythank you very much donaldlynch82yahoocom,the product doesnt work right i have a book 
4.0,i like this kindle i previously owned the very first kindle model but it was dropped which killed the screen and had to be replaced maneuvering on that model was super simple its not simple and intuitive on this model and what i hate is that like with so many other things that are manufactured these days a physical instruction manual doesnt come with it even a quick reference guide would be better than nothing i cant tell you how many times i touched something unintentionally and it wasnt obvious or easy finding my place again as it was on the old model on this thing you have to use a slider bar to guess where you were and skim pages to figure it out because if you choose last page read it takes you right back to the wrong page you accidentally arrived at in the first place i still havent figured out how to alphabetize my list of books from the cloud so be prepared there is definitely a learning curve thats going to throw you a few curves,i like this kindle
1.0,stop working after 7 month,one star
2.0,it worked fine for a few days and then it locked and remained locked i have been in touch with the correct departments for trying to repair it i have been told to return it and have been sent a replacement,locked kindle
1.0,not intuitivenot apple,one star
1.0,dont like it very slow ,one star
5.0,it was so easy to download all of my books onto my new kindle i bought this to read before bed each night since youre supposed to avoid exposure to the blue light emitted by electronics before you go to bed it is easy to hold even with the case i bought im definitely enjoying iteven out in the bright sunshine,love this
3.0,there is indoor glare on the screen i havent tried it outside as yet not impressed ps the reason it seems cheaper is that you dont get the 30 ac adaptor like you used to tackytackytackyi do like the fact that it is smaller and lighter weight than my old one beyond that same old same old i got a new one because i absolutely hate the kindle fire that i got a few years back it has its uses but i never was happy with it and my old tried and true no frills kindle was finally saying enough,three stars
5.0,my eyes cannot handle led lighting on computers smartphones and similar products this seventh generation kindle works well for me and does not give me any eyestrain or headaches i absolutely love it,no eye strain with this one
1.0,does not support epub formatdoes not display page number or page numbertotal instead says something like loc 134there is display thoughalso it does not support organizing books in folders,does not support epub format
4.0,i love my new kindle it is much easier on the eyes to read on this than my ipad or galaxy tab my only complaint and its minor is there were a couple of times where the kindle froze and the font kept going big to small then back to big i couldnt stop it and had a difficult time trying to reboot it but the battery life is pretty good i can go several days before i need to charge it i also like that it is very lightweight and my wrist doesnt hurt holding it for a long period of time,i love my new kindle
2.0,too expenve for its features,two stars
5.0,i owned the original kindle and the kindle keyboard in the past this one is a great improvement over the old eink readers i didnt consider the paperwhite or voyage as they are expensive and feel the kindle is good enough i use my ipad for most things and use the kindle for reading i personally not bothered by lack of backlit screen as i always have a light source in my room the kindle is cheap and easy for traveling and reading a novel,good eink reader for the price
2.0,dont like the constant ads,two stars
5.0,nice tablet i am pleased by the ease of managing my books and the easy to read format only draw back is you need a light to read by the paper white is not backlit but that is why the battery lasts for 30 days or more i knew that when i decided to buy this much easier on the eyes than reading on a tablet,easy on the eyes
3.0,please remove from my kindle,three stars
1.0,i hate it my old kindle finally gave way and i am trying to figure out this kindles pages confusing i have order two books by accident i dont need to see the covers of the books i have on this kindle the older kindle just had a list with the title and author which was perfect  when you finished you just send the book to your archives i have no idea how to send the books to the archives when finished on this thing help,horrible
2.0,fontsfontd too small for me,two stars
5.0,i love my kindle reader we have two in our family if our house was one fire this would be one of the electronic devices i would grab on the way out what a bargain to have so many books at your fingertips this is much easier on the eyes than reading on a tablet laptop etc of course it doesnt have the wow factor of an ipad we have four of those but as an inexpensive ereader you cant beat it its so nice to have all your books handy and no need to dedicate closet space to them anymore ,a great ereader
1.0,the performance is too poor,one star
4.0,good reader easy to take places easy to read on disappointed by the nonlit screen although it works well for my child she should not be turning on devices after the lights are off anyway the screen is rather slow so the browser is only useful in a pinch have not tried the calendar yet its really a book for me as an adult sometimes reading while putting a child to sleep i would upgrade to the backlit version,good reader easy to take places
2.0,can not read in dark room,only read during the day outside
1.0,perhaps i am overlooking some advantages that this kindle might have however i find this kindle not nearly as satisfactory as my pervious two kindles it is difficult to operate and is confusing frankly i would prefer my last kindle to this one,perhaps i am overlooking some advantages that this kindle might 
3.0,i wish that it had a light on the screen so i could read at night,three stars
1.0,toooooooooooo expensive,one star
1.0,not at all what i expected,one star
1.0,device is good but be aware that if you buy it with a discount you have all these crappy ads that pop up on the device it isnt even tailored to my preferences which is sucky if you want to get them off you have to pay the difference from the discount you had,device is good but be aware that if you buy it 
2.0,disappointed very fussy ,two stars
5.0,after years of thinking i wouldnt like an ereader i finally broke down and purchased one so far i love it the screen is very easy on the eyes and i love having easy access to various kindle books on amazon,after years of thinking i wouldnt like an ereader
5.0,pretty good like it very much,five stars
2.0,i am a big fan of the kindle ive owned every model since the 2nd one this was somewhat of a disappointment no audio and it wont run any of the games i had on previous models plus it has the deeper screen so there is an edge all the way around the screen which likes to trap dust lint crumbs the only thing this ereader will do is display text and allow highlighting thats it i still believe the best model kindle ever released is the one currently called the kindle keyboard with the extendable light from the corner of the optional case,more features disappear with this ereader
1.0,dont like it one little bit the older model which i had for years with buttons and sliders were much more user friendly hate the ads that keep appearing when it is at rest,piece of crap
4.0,i really like the paperwhite kindle there are a few ease of access issues and all kindles seem to desperately want you to use the cloud drive now but i love the lack of eye strain and the huge memory really i can put loads of books on there i hate touch screens and all those finger marks that go with them but this one isnt all that bad as far as they go it must be the glare free screen the the finger marks are not as bad i dont much like the adds but they can be ignored just fine it is so lightweight and small about like some paperbacks i can just stick it in my bag,mostly good
1.0,pdf docs do not show very well,one star
5.0,great for reading during the day so many free or almost free books available the only thing i think is off about it they claim the adds do not drain the battery i knew i wasnt going to use it for a while so i charged it and left it for about 4 weeks when i used it again the battery was almost completely drained so either the adds do drain it or the battery loses it charge in about a month either way i still love it i would recommend you wait till its on sale its a little high for just a reader but you can justify it if you read a ton of free books,great
5.0,purchased for my teen great,great
5.0,i am big on saving papers having all my mails as electronic mails and trying to convince my professors that i will submit all my work online not hand in papers this saved my life and my shoulders this is not the old days that you carry a bag full with books that big chemistry book and all those lap notes and papers i love it i have been using it for almost 2 years now and it works amazing very cheap very hard build it will last a long time ,save paper save trees save mother nature
5.0,a,five stars
4.0,to bad each gen has different covers that fit properly it is a little hard to find what gen you product is and not all covers are advertised with the same name or style description some gen some name some unclear too bad there is not a code or number to clear up what you own and the same code on the cover for a sure fit i really do not want to know all about when or what gen it is just want to protect it and have fun using the kindle,to bad each gen has different covers that fit properly
1.0,no to dark cant read screen,one star
4.0,great upgrade i had the older kindle i bought it to replace older model because i liked the fact that it was touch screen and it was so easy to set up the only con is that the home page font is a tad smaller to read and this is not adjustable but everything else is great the light weight makes it so comfortable and screen display is perfect in the day time to read i love it,what a difference touchscreen and lightweight make it so comfortable to read
5.0,great product my third one,great product my third one
3.0,i finally like it now that ive figured out how to install the books i purchased amazon really could have made things more user friendly for a novice like me the help topics took me in circles until i was near tears with frustration after several hours once i figured it out i was fine but there was no way to ask a simple question from a live person for that reason i would recommend that newbies like me start with a nook or some such which is purchased in an actual store with live people who are willing to help,for a novice it was hard to get started
2.0,no light for nitetime reading,two stars
5.0,i am pleased with it one reason i purchased it i am going over seas and needed something light weighti did not want to carry a large amount of books this is perfect,very pleased
5.0,ill be comparing this to the other two kindles i have experience with the keyboard and the paperwhitefirst order of business this does not have a light sorry its just that so many people seem to think it has a light when it clearly states that it doesnt if you want a light get a paperwhite theyre great toothis simple little kindle was a deal crazy sale that i couldnt pass up as i knew id need a replacement for my keyboard model anyway i also need something to slip into my bag so i can read while im waiting or sitting in a coffee shop or commutingscreen size about the same on all three models this makes sense but i decided to mention itresolution the resolution is better than that of the kindle keyboard again this makes sense since its a later model of kindle and almost as good as the paperwhitecolorbrightness this isnt a tablet so there wouldnt be any color ive seen it mentioned in other reviews which is why i mention it here the screen appears as bright as the kindle keyboard that is it looks like the page of an open book it is not as bright as the paperwhite so there is not as great a contrast this isnt a complaint though since the paperwhite is always lit when i compared i had the light setting down as low as it could go and by nature will always be brighterpage turn i miss my buttons but the touch screen is nice as well the kindle 6 that im reviewing here seems to have a very sensitive touchscreen as compared with the paperwhite this means that if you brush against it it might go forward or back a page or two i fixed this by getting a cover and closing it when im not immediately reading really thats all it tookspeed i had no issues it was quite quick to load whatever i wantedcollections you can import your collections from your cloud though youll have to download each book individually this was actually a good thing since im realizing i dont need all of my books on my device all the time heh maybe that has something to do with how fast this thing isend grade 45 stars rounded up im biased though i just really love the kindle and im still amazed at how many free books there areadded if any issues come up ill amend this review,very happy
4.0,ok im giving it four stars because it works well but i only use it as a backup because believe it or not that back light is a very important feature and this kindle does not have it i bought it thinking that i can just read it like a book with the lights on but its not that easy after having a back lighted kindle for so long i thought it died which is why i bought a new one it didnt really it was just frozen so maybe its in the process of dying anyway going to this one was too much of a hassle so i wound up buying a new paperwhite within a couple weeks i didnt return this one though because theres nothing wrong with it as long as the light is on ,good but not great
5.0,first kindle ereader i have used in short it does what i wanted it for to read books outside through a free service and amazon i have 300 books on it in less than a week it was easy to learn to use this kindle touch i have 4 other tablets from apple samsung bn color and rca they all have their uses in the family but none are good outside in texas i do miss the the audio books on this model when we made our last trip down from alaska to texas we were forced to load them to our navigation device for the hours of no or bad radio signal areas this of course didnt sync with the kindle so we had to find where we left off to read on in the kindle from the audio in the car,great ereader for outside reading this is not a tablet 
1.0,very satisfied with my 2nd kindle,one star
4.0,im an old school kindle user i had the one with the page buttons on the side of the unit i like the new version butthe touch screen takes getting used to in order to turn the pages i usually hold with my left hand and you cant turn the page with one hand with that hand because you have to swipe or touch the right side so its a two hand unit for me could be worse things i guess but i long for my page buttonsotherwise the unit is very clear keeps cool to the touch outside which is a plus over the previous unit and has some additional features that are very helpful as well,i like the new version but
1.0,dont waste your money its junk,one star
5.0,i am so thrilled that i purchased this ereading kindle device now ive spent litterally hours reading from it one of the numerous books i have located in my kindle library i use my fires hdx and 2 fire phones to do other important to me thingscrapgarbagewhatnot but with this i worry not about having to recharge it due to spent battery power by leaving it on or paused because it automatically turns itself off or powers down to conserve nrg my favorite feature i believe lol now to find and purchase a case to keep it cozy before too terribly long down the time road  lol always a pleasure working shopping with amazon com its affiliate merchants amazon is the only place 2 shop  in my opinion obviously thanks always again always leanne m pruitt 1603 quail run muskogee ok 744038456 918 5772027,absolutely best purchase ever i own numerous kindle devices 2 fire phones 1 hdx 2 keyboards but this is the best ereader
1.0,terrible it will not hold charge,kindle will not hold charge
5.0,what a lightweight easy to read kindle i got mine with a special offer which made it even more sweet for traveling going to the beach or just taking to the office this kindle will not let you down,what a lightweight easy to read kindle
1.0,find it awkward to use had one of the original kindles which i liked very much,had one of the original kindles which i liked very much
1.0,i didnt like the touch screen as well as the key board the touch screen was too sensitive would jump to other screens if i touched it on the screen i returned my touch screen and purchased a used key board kindle,i didnt like the touch screen as well as the key board
3.0,its not as good as my original one i bought 4 years ago which had g3,its not as good as my original one i bought 4 years ago 
3.0,i had the old kindle with the buttons on the side unfortunately i broke that one and bought this one as a replacement since that style was no longer offered i like the touch screen because i can look up words i dont know on the fly however i really miss the buttons on the side to turn the page i feel like i am constantly changing the font size turning pages or opening menus on accident with the touch screen also i cant turn the page back if i am holding with my right hand i miss the old kindle or a hybrid of the two would be nice however since that isnt currently a purchasing option this one is fine for what is available,miss the old kindle
2.0,the brightness is not adjustable,two stars
5.0,im a tech horder basically something new comes out thats rather affordable and i buy it i didnt actually need the kindle cause i have my phone and my ipad but i got it to read in direct sunlight at the beach i think for this its amazingive never owned a kindle before so i cannot compare models but for a firsttime occasional user i think its great i dont know what it would be like if i read everyday but ill update as i use it more frequently,everything i expected
3.0,no wireless connection included,three stars
4.0,when i first started playing with this i thought what a piece of junk but after i got the feel of it i enjoyed it if you think you are getting an ipad for cheap think again an ipad it is not it is a reader an alternative to paper it has a very basic internet browser subtract a star but hard to use i found this great for kids because it is bombproof and cheap add a star it doesnt have a back light so you cant read it at night or in the car subtract a star the parental controls are minimal but i can see if my kid is ordering off amazon as i get emails it took awhile to figure out how to borrow from the public library amazon now gives 1 credit if you choose longer shipping so that is a plus for book purchases kindle books generally run a dollar less than paperback,great for kids
1.0,breaks so quickly lasts a year,breaks so quickly
5.0,i have bought 5 kindles now each one has been handed down to the kids for movies games and whatever kids do now my needs are simple i want a place to store reference manuals books and documents i need it small enough to be able to always have it handy i dont want any extra dodads that will inspire my teens to acquire and hijack my kindle most of all it has to be tough for the work shop this is simple tough light affordable and saves a lot of room and weight for all i need to carry it proved its worth in just the last 4 day trip i took great focus long battery charge recharges quick and i have no one whining to use it what else could you ask for,beyond expectations
2.0,not a fan too hard to navigate,two stars
1.0,there is so much crap on it from amazon that it eats the battery up,one star
2.0,who wants to read of a gray background,two stars
1.0,not enough instrucctions of how to usew,one star
1.0,i only bought this kindle because my old one kept quitting on me then i would have to reboot it sometimes spending several minutes to get it to respond sometimes it would decide to reboot itself in the middle of me reading this new kindle might be great for someone just starting out but i had every thing organized in categories and then i had to try and duplicate that organization in my new one the books are in the cloud whatever that means so i have to try to find them and download them anyway it is way too much trouble i will keep plugging away on my old kindle i am just glad the new one didnt cost much it will now just sit in a drawer unless i can find someone to give it to,old kindle much better for me
4.0,did not arrive when they said it would,four stars
5.0,i have a kindle hdx 89 inch that i love and carried with me everywhere however because of the size it forced me to carry a larger purse than was always convenient also i was very nervous about using the hdx around water such as at the nail salon or in the bath tub which are two of my favorite places to catch up on my reading id considered purchasing the basic kindle reader for these purposes but wasnt motivated to follow through until it was recently on sale for 59 i am enjoying it much more than i expected it takes up very little room in my purse even in its case wifi speed is superfast easy to navigate the touch screen works great and it has a lot more bells and whistles than i was expecting it would have been a great buy even at the regular price of 79,great backup kindle to my hdx
5.0,this is very usefull who likes reading,five stars
5.0,i had resisted buying an ereader for a while i love to read and i always have but for some reason ereaders just felt wrong to me i didnt think they would read like a book and they seemed too expensive to justify the purchase compared to the 68 per title i tend to spend on used books i tend to have a couple books im reading at any given time and i like to bring them everywhere with me and it was getting increasingly harder to shove 34 paperbacks into my laptop bag everyday to make sure i had something to read everywhere i went so with the price of ereaders coming down i thought id check them outi found this refurbished kindle for around 60 so i ordered it ive used it every day since i love it its super convenient to be able to bring such a huge library with me from place to place in such a small package and to my surprise it really does read like a book i dont feel like im looking at a screen the electronic ink is really easy on the eyes and looks just like the page of a book ive been reading on it for at least an hour and half every day since ive gotten itif youre already a very active reader and are considering getting an ereader i would give this a try it really does feel like a book,glad i jumped on the bandwagon
1.0,no backlight cheap case construction,one star
5.0,the recent black friday sales on this unit convinced me to purchase a replacement for a five year old kindle that was losing contrast or maybe it was my eyes at any rate the glare free unit is small but with a viewable screen the same size as my original how the touch screen capability replacing the side direction keys and the keyboard the readability is darn near amazing allowing these old eyes to read in subdued light i personally do not find the ads to be a problem especially since you can turn the screen to blank if you desire i find most of the ads interesting as they generally refer to books i might like to read battery life is good but it is too early to tell if this will last the unit is very light hence the battery concern and very portable the charger cube does not exist on this unit but since it is a micro usb your phone changer will likely work charging time appears to be reasonable i had approx two week of reading nightly which showed about half battery usage it recharged to full indicated by the green led display along the bottom edge in about an hour i would recommend to a friend especially at the sale price,price performance winner in my opinion
2.0,too dark cannot adjust brightness,screen is hard to see
5.0,just now i accidentally threw my kindle across the cafeteria the device popped out of my bag when i was swinging it off my shoulder and it flew at least six feet in the air it hit the concrete hard it should have broken the screen shouldnt have been working after that incident but it did there were no marks on the device when i picked it up and thoroughly examined it this kindle is well builtthe only downside ive had so far is the touchscreen often when im reading i bump the screen and the pages switch or the font changes sizes sometimes i wish it still had buttons and a feature to disable the touchscreen when reading however the touchscreen is very good for annotating looking up words highlighting important passages clicking on bits to look up a wikipedia article are all useful features construction touchscreen features touchscreen sensitivity,threw my kindle onto concrete it was fine
1.0,hate this one screen is very dark,not good
4.0,its a lot faster than the kindle keyboard and i havent had any issues with turning pages some persons have complained about accidental page turns but then i also have it in a case elsse for kindle 6 because i like to have cases for my tablets and ereaders to provide additional protection and to make it easier to readit is short and most likely because of the shortness it appears unusually thickthe one gripe i have so far is that i set it up with a passcode which i have to enter but instead of automatically unlocking the kindle i still have to swipe across the screen to open,good reader
1.0,too hard to use unclearinstructions,one star
5.0,i really enjoy this kindlei like using the look up for words with which im unfamiliari like being able to easily find out who a character is as im not remembering the minor characters as well as i did as a youngster i like using this function to get a bit more historical data on real characters as wellthe reading surface easily accommodates dim to bright lighti also like being able to swipe or touch the screen to turn a page it used to be difficult to go between my kindle and my tablet because i wanted to swipe my older kindle  d,makes for a good reading experience
5.0,best product a,five stars
5.0,i bought this kindle to replace my previous kindle which i had owned for more than three years the previous kindle had buttons on the side to page back and forth and handle other actions on the device and i was admittedly hesitant to buy this one due to having all functions on a touchscreen instead especially since i have large fingertips thankfully i have had no problems using any of the functions on this device and i also like its faster speed and larger storage capacitythe one drawback which is admittedly very minor is pressing a button to wake up the device and then still needing to swipe the screen to actually use the device to me this twostep process seems to be needless but again this is only a very minor issue,very nice replacement for an old kindle
1.0,its hard to read with no light and it all looks blurry wasnt happy with it at all,not happy with it
5.0,i am really enjoying my kindle its a plain vanilla basic version with no light but thats fine with me if its dark ill read it with a regular light just like a book its easy to read and use and i can see that its going to become a good companion whenever i travel too,fun to use
4.0,i use it all the time much easier to use then carrying a book around and you can free up space at home with this reader remember though this is just for reading it is a no frills reader that is very convenient from a reading aspect it is awesome and the brighter the location the better best part is the battery as the ad said i only need to charge is every few weeks and charges very quicklyi have found it simpler to shop for my kindle books via my computer but you can access the store through the kindle too,from a reading aspect it is awesome and the brighter the location the better
5.0,i had heard and read that the kindle with the paperwhite could cause problems with sleep patterns i had been reading at night primarily and was having insomnia that is why i ordered the kindle glare free screen it also had the touch screen that i had with my other kindle i have really been happy with this purchase i no longer have the insomnia and have all the touch screen ability of my other kindle this new kindle also has a long battery lifeover all i am very happy with this purchase,i have really been happy with this purchase
2.0,loved my first kindle with the keyboard i am not as happy with this one grip all the books are stored in the cloud what ever that is with no separation from books that have been read if one is a voracious reader at book a day or at least 4 books a week there is no longer an archive for books read only the cloud i have a little over 1600 books books that are removed from device return to the cloud and are first in the queue this system forces me to dig through everything i have already read to find new reading material it will skip several pages at once if care is not taken when trying to turn pages the images of the bookcovers are so small it is almost impossible to read the titles when looking at queued books with any type of vision impairment it would be impossible i preferred having the list of unread books written out in order of purchase or in sequence if a series yes it is smaller as there is no longer a keyboard it is a bit lighter but not enough to hold with just one hand if one is older and arthritic all in all i would love to have my old kindle back or at least have the option of replacing with that same model sorry amazon you blew it with this one,loved my first kindle with the keyboard
3.0,could be bigger and more options of books,three stars
5.0,ive never owned an ereader before but am thrilled that i took a leap and tried this one its not the same as paper books but there are lots of advantages that a paper book cant offer i can get books instantly from the library whenever i want i can find out the meaning of a word at the touch of a button i can search for the same word or phrase elsewhere in the book i can turn the page with a touch of a finger i love this device and suspect it will be a long time before i read another novel in paper formati chose this basic model over the kindle paperwhite and am very please with my choice the paperwhite primarily adds front lighting to allow you to read in the dark i would rather not read in a dark room anyway and use a bedside lamp at night so i dont need the light in my kindle the text is extremely clear with the ability to increase font size as desired the only difficulty i have had with the device is remembering that the touch screen works like a mouse with single touches in identified locations rather than like a tablet or smart phone that understands swipe touches this is not a serious issue since there are very few interactions besides turning pages that i need to do with the kindle i highly recommend this product for anyone that reads fiction books,excellent for novels and library books
1.0,when it worked it was a good e readerunfortunately after barely a year my screen completely glitched out there was no trauma to the unit it was sitting in a case on the stand overnight they told me there was nothing they can do i had a nook for almost 5 years so having a kindle break down after 1 isnt very inspiringwouldnt purchase another one,not satisfied at all
4.0,i bought this kindle to replace my first one i love that it is smaller and lighter which makes it easier to carry in my purse the one thing that i miss is the way to turn the pages this is a touch screen and you can only turn the page forward on the right i much preferred my previous kindle that had both forward and backwards buttons on both sides i found that much more convenient,i love that it is smaller and lighter which makes it 
1.0,cant use it register it sign in to it,one star
5.0,it took some getting used to having black and white versus color but after a week its not so bad going through the user guide is a good idea due to the differences with this and the kindle fire hd i used to havethe internet can be used but it is not nearly the same as using it on a computer tablet or smartphonei like that i can email attachments to the email given for the kindle i like to keep pdfs and documents on my old fire hd such as vacation literaryi dont miss playing games or fb thats what my smartphone and computer are for,better features than i thought it would have
1.0,it does not fit my 6 kindle crappy,crappy
4.0,i love the idea of it not sure ive mastered all the complexities of it sometimes i have trouble getting the pages to turn sometimes i dont you can enlarge the fonts too many ebooks advertised on it must have accidentally clicked where i shouldnt have they downloaded one of the advertised books and charged me 200  i sent it right back havent got the refund yet just have to be careful in future,i love the idea of it
1.0,will be returning it back light needed,one star
5.0,i have both a kindle fire hd and this 7th generation kindle 6 i love both of them for different reasons i take the kindle 7th generation with me everywhere its extremely light and perfectly sized to fit into my purse the display is easy on the eyes and the touchscreen makes pageturning a breeze i highly recommend this to anyone looking for a basic entrylevel ereader,love it
3.0,should have gotten one wbuilt in light,three stars
4.0,i figured out how it worked in a minute or two because i am experienced with an ipad and the original kindle it is smaller than the original but i got use to that very fast and i must say the screen is very clear and easy to read using the settings by touching on the top took some figuring out but experience told me to try there i dont know why they changed but i presume it was to get the size and price and the fireversion is more for those who want to do more to read my old kindle broke down and i had to buy the new one i had no problems downloading books that i have previously bought over all i am certainly satisfied i tried the free book offer that came with it but found the books limited and little that i might want,satisfied reader
3.0,i wish it had a light for night reading,three stars
2.0,the only reason for purchasing this was the death of my first kindle after years of constant use i guess everything wears out eventually i read a lot so replacement was necessary and the price was acceptablelets talk about the nice things first1 sizeits perfect portable and fits beautifully in both hand and purse2 battery lifeit doesnt seem to need charging as often as my older version did3 internet accessvery handy not having to stop and go online to download a booknow for the reasons why im only giving it 2 stars1 touchscreenhate hate hate every time i turn around it changes my page even worse it changes my font size2 page turn buttoni really miss that feature but the cost of the oasis isnt justified by that feature alone3 home pagei get it you want to sell books but the layout and graphics dont do the books justice so i end up using my pc to do my browsing,kindleyou can do better
3.0,i would like to return for kindle color,three stars
4.0,this is actually a gift my daughter earned from school she is 6 years old she has been spoiled with other tablets and doesnt understand why this one doesnt do the same things as the others she has however in a couple years i feel she will learn to appreciate it she enjoys reading stories with color and pictures and this is not necessarily suitable for her age because it is missing color and picturesas an owner of several kindles i do like how the screen is glare free compared to the kindle fire and kindle fire hd it is very nice when reading outside how you dont have to keep moving it around to stop the glare from hurting your eyes kindle fire is great for watching showsmovies and other apps but for actual reading i like the glare free screen,kindle ereader
5.0,i love it not enough likes for this item,five stars
2.0,would enjoy much more if it was lighted,two stars
3.0,i wish i had done some research on this i assumed it had a light for night time reading it will work,it will work
1.0,my family decided to upgrade my reading technology and help reduce a large library in a small space this kindle was a very bad choice for me i have a precateract condition even a with larger and bolder font i experienced eye strain if there is any looking at this kindle who has any physical eye issues you should test this device for a few days,precateract condition or other eye problems
3.0,i wish i had picked a different kindle instead of this one it works good and i can read my books anywhere i have trouble finding my place and i find that the instructions are not clear i have to search for answers which takes more time then i want to spend i would rather be reading my bookanother complaint i have is that there is no way to make the screen lighter or brighter so i can see the words when i am in a darker place i have to turn on a lamp or somethinggood news is that it works almost like magic when i am outside even in the sun,works great outside or in the sun
1.0,is not user friendly can not download games,one star
5.0,i have been strongly opposed to all types of ereaders for a long time despite owning all sorts of electronic gadgets after signing up for amazon prime and thus the added benefits with owning a kindle i decided to give it a try im shocked to say i actually love it i bought the cheaper model just because i already have a tablet i appreciate the lowtech aspects a lot seriously the fact that it doesnt have a back light makes it feel more like a real book to me i also found that reading on my phone or tablet made my eyes tired a lot faster than reading a book this reads a lot like a book to me and i love that also the battery on it is amazing i always worried that if i used an ereader the battery would constantly die on me at the worst possible time i have read 2 entire books on this and still havent had to charge the battery,im shocked to say i actually love it i bought the cheaper model just because 
5.0,enjoying my kindle a birthday gift to myself,great gift
5.0,i had the very first kindle and i loved the idea of it about 3 years ago it died completely it just stopped charging i decided to get something new and looked at the kindle fire hd previously i bought an i pad for my dad for christmas and he loved it so i decided to get an i pad as i could use the kindle app and a bunch of other things on it i dont regret getting the i pad but i found that i didnt use the kindle app on it as much because reading on it after a while bothered my eyes i saw the promotion for this kindle for 29 dollars and thought what the heck i miss my old kindle why not try the new one for 29 dollarsits a basic kindle e reader it does its basic job well i find it easier to navigate over the first kindle its nice and small but not too small and lightweight i have only been using for about 3 hours but i love it especially since i wont get distracted by other bells and whistles for 29 dollars this was a great purchase i have a feeling they may be phasing this model out or getting ready to release a new modeli am not bothered by not having a keyboard or page turning buttons its very basic and that it what i like about it i read a review where someone mentioned having the background a little lighter grey and i agree but its nothing a book light or good lighting wouldnt fixoverall i am thrilled with this purchase at such a great price however if i were to pay full price i would probably splurge and get the paperwhite also i was worried about the ads but they really dont bother me i quite like the suggestions that they providei decided to get the infiland amazon kindle 2014 7th gen case for 11 dollars over spending more on a case than i paid for the kindle itself and it isnt perfect but it does its job as well,great basic kindle on a budget
2.0,very hard to download from other than amazon,two stars
4.0,this unit is not user friendly when i try to hold it in the corners to read things are always popping up on the screen the most annoying of which is the font size menu which always goes back to the default then you have to bring it up again and reset it i dont know why it cant hold the setting you put in when you start reading a book because as you know fonts etc have to be changed from book to book i also dont like that it doesnt have the buttons so that i can play all my old word games when this goes bad in two years which is what ive been told the life expectancy is i will definitely research all readers before i purchase another if you are looking for a reader i would suggest if you could do hands on research before you buy,this unit is annoying and not user friendly
1.0,one can barely see the words waste of money,waste of money
5.0,ive only had the kindle for a couple of weeks but i do love it do i miss the feeling for the good old printed books yes however the ease of buying books and having them immediately without having to go to a store and buy them or library in hopes that they have the book i wish to read is gone and thats not a bad thing getting my book immediately and for a lower cost than the hard copies is a big plus also the light weight of the kindle is excellent i like to read in bed and my arms and hands no longer get tired or cramped with the kindle so overall and so far the kindle has lived up to its expectations and i am very pleased with it now when asked i can request amazon gift cards for ebooks keeping in mind that i have no other kindles to compare this to i do recommend this kindle because of its ease of obtaining books immediately and the ease of use,so far i love this amy first kindle
2.0,this item is no more glare free than my older kindle touch not worth the up grade save your money,this item is no more glare free than my older 
5.0,i have enjoyed kindle since 2008 and i dont have one single complaint i have been fortunate to have 2 kindles previously before receiving this new updated model for christmas i love my kindle it is lightweight and for an avid reader like myself it is just perfect i dont really like the backlit models because they case some eyestrain overall for the price it is worth every penny,3rd kindle
2.0,lousy fit cover doesnt snap in all the way,two stars
5.0,love love love my kindle when my house was burglarized thousands of dollars of items were taken my kindle was the thing i replaced first this is my third kindle my first was the keyboard version my second the paperwhite and ive now returned to this more originallike simpler version i never cared as much for the paperwhite as i do this one with the elegant subtle greyongrey text to page i was bummed after ordering because during my 2day wait amazon announced its newer greater dpi version of the paperwhite however as soon as i started reading on my new little elegant kindle i was in love all over again love this i even sometimes accidentally flip my kindle closed at the end of the page because i literally turn the page thinking im reading a book this is not like reading on an ipad its like reading a book,love love
3.0,its not backlit cant read it in the dark,three stars
4.0,love the functionality of the latest generation of kindle but more than i bargained for with the special offers it is one thing to have them on the sleep screen but putting banner ads on the bottom of the home screen is annoying however the features far outweigh the annoyance,great device with too many ads
2.0,no setting for backlit brightness my eyes are straining  too difficult to read  so i am sending back,no setting for backlit brightness my eyes are straining 
5.0,easy to use and great way to hold my books i am not a tech savvy person but found this very easy to navigate and was able to turn off all the suggested books on home page to make the kindle an adfree tool,easy to use and great way to hold my books
4.0,much has already been said about this device so i will keep my comments brief this was a replacement for a kindle keyboard ive had and enjoyed for years im happy i made the switch i find it easy to use and when reading its just as seamless as turning the pages of a paper book once you are used to the controls the device itself fades into the background which is the point i do find that sometimes the touchscreen seems a little finicky occasionally it doesnt register a tap for a page turn or turns more than one page at a time but this is a pretty minor thing the other thing that sometimes gets annoying is that for whatever strange reason it is too easy to change the font size with a random bump on the screen maybe its just me but if i carry the device with the cover open and my hand slips onto the screen it just seems to always go to the change font menu and i end up with a screen of wonkysized text,glad i upgraded
2.0,very little backlight hard to read in low light,two stars
3.0,i couldnot get out of this thing flusterating gr,three stars
4.0,i got this because it was on special for valentines day so i cant really comment on the pricereally light weight easy to hold took me a little while to figure out how to get my collections to download from the cloud but no too longsince my first kindle was the one with the qwerty keyboard sorry cant remember the name this one is reasonably different to navigate however ive also got the kindle app on my phone so its kind of a cross between navigating my old kindle and navigating on my kindle appthe screen is very clear the pictures on the screensaver are very crisp and there is no discernible pixels in the shading so download any books with pictures should be fine as long as youre ok with black and white,good buy
1.0,way too dark and really puts a strain on my eyes,too dark
5.0,i am in love with this kindle i will be honest after having issues with my first kindle i believe it was the 2nd generation and then the kindle fire i vowed that i would never buy another kindle device again instead i would just use the free kindle app on my android tablet or phone that was before i started having migraines nearly everyday reading on a backlit screen such as my laptop phone or tablet made these migraines worse being an avid reader i decided to give the kindle another trythe size and weight of this kindle is perfect its comfortable for both one handed and two handed reading i have arthritis in my hands so this was really important the text is crisp and clear it is so much easier to read than on a tablet or other similar device it really feels like im reading a real book instead of a digital book the battery life is amazing i binge read 4 rather long books took me about a week and that battery lasted the whole time with lighter reading the battery lasts much longer its over a week since i last charged it and its only at about 75 my first kindle did not have the touchscreen feature and i must admit i love iti did try the web browsing but honestly if you want to web browse use a different device this device is made for reading books it excels at that if you are buying it for the option to browse the internet there are plenty of other devices that do that i suppose the only feature that would be nice on it would maybe be texttospeech but its not really missed it would be easier to listen to audio books on my phone anyway as that is a smaller device and can just sit in my pocketif you want an excellent ereader you cant beat this one especially given that the kindle store probably contains the most free and discounted books in the market,loving my kindle 6
2.0,i like the display on the original much better,better before
5.0,i absolutely love my new kindle it is going to be hard to retire my kindle keyboard which has served me very well however the keyboard on the new kindle is much easier to use and it has more features than the kindle keyboard the only thing that i am not as crazy about on my new kindle is that the edge has been squared off instead of having a more gentle rounded sloping edge i notice that my husbands paperwhite also has the more sloping rounded edge which is a tad easier to hold the squared off edge as kindle 6 glarefree has is a tad less comfortable but i am sure i will get used to it especially with all of the new features i guess it is just hard to give up my old friend the keyboard it became a close companion but i look forward to making my new kindle just as close a companion,love it
1.0,dis not like that i could not keep letter uniorm,one star
5.0,i got this because it is super light and small no it does not have a backlight so i just turn on a light it is like having a paperback since i have the kindle fire 89 this is a great addition when i am running around and want to bring a book to read if i am waiting somewhere or even when i was flying just stick it in my purse and ready to go the charge on this lasts a long time it does not have all the bells and whistles but still has the dictionary and some nice features great kindle for a great price,just like having a book
2.0,theres absolutely nothing wrong with this product i simply find that i dont use it like i thought i would in fact ive never used it sorry i purchased it should have invested in an ipad instead, i simply find that i dont use it like i thought i would
5.0,having figured out how the touch screen kindle works i really like it this is the newer kindle device that has the same touchscreen as the paperwhite does rather than the old buttons on the bottom the only differences between this and the paperwhite is that it doesnt have a light so its a little smaller and lighter and the screen resolution is slightly less my wifes paperwhite has 2 mb memory while the newer kindles have 4 mb memory it is worth it to get the kindle case with the device as it protects it well shuts it down when you close it and turns it on when you open it thats much easier to deal with than the little power button on the bottom the resolution is quite adequate and reading is easy,like the kindle 6 glarefree touchscreen display
3.0,it does not seem to have a lighted screenso you cannot not read in a dark room i was very disappointed with that,i was very disappointed with that
5.0,i bought the entry level model at least in part for budgetary reasons and because i just didnt need higher end features my main pro even at small sizes the characters are crystal clear and easy to read thats with bifocals and aging eyes its comfortable for reading for extended periods the lack of a backlight was never an issue for me it arrived wellpackaged my only complaint is not with the kindle so much as with touch screens generally i have some tremors in the ol hands and sometimes touching the right typing key is dicey i wont be doing much text input but that is another consequence of aging and certainly not a ding on the product if you dont need or want color or a backlight get this version you should be satisfied with it,crystalclear text even at smaller sizes excellent for aging eyes
3.0,it dose not let you read in the dark no light,three stars
4.0,kindle needs a printed quick start leading to the users guide love the light weight of it screen brightness is inadequate for low light reading,best part of this new kindle is the weight
2.0,difficult to connect to internet to synchronize,two stars
4.0,i purchased this kindle back in july primarily because it was a lightning deal for 4900 my intentions were to either give this one to my wife or replace my older kindle and give her that one after playing around with it for about a week i decided to give her the new onefor a basic ereader at the price i paid its definitely a good investment when comparing to my older model however a kindle keyboard 3g this new one just feels very cheaply built its a very lightweight plastic design that feels almost hollow on the inside i get the impression it could be even thinner than it is but the thickness of the design somehow keeps the production costs downhaving been so used to the solid feel of my kindle keyboard and really gaining nothing new or better with this model in my opinion i chose to stick with the kindle keyboard as my go to ereader my wife has been very happy with this model and it gets the job done regarding the special offers that keep the purchase price lower i cant see any reason why someone wouldnt be in favor of this the offers are not intrusive at all and ive actually come across a couple of good reads based on whats displayed while the reader is off,a decent ereader for the price
5.0,so farso good quick delivery as described,five stars
5.0,for a strict e reader this product is good i always use a book light and i can truly say it does have an appearance of a real book which i enjoy it doesnt have a glare and battery life is outstanding been using mine for a solid week for hours at a time and battery hasnt budged prices for books on the kindle are also very affordable and cheaper than regular books which is nice,like a real book
4.0,i had the first kindle and this new is much better and the software is elegant to use the is one problem and that is because the kindle is so light and the edges to hold it so small that i was constantly touching the screen and turning pages before i wanted i found the solution flygrip i found this product and it lets you hold the kindle comfortably you can manipulate all functions one handed and you never accidently touch the screen this item is as elegant a solution as the kindle software it was such a great product i bought one for all the cell phones in the family, had the first kindle and this new is much better and the software is elegant to use
4.0,love it miss the built in light of the papperwhite,four stars
4.0,very good but would benefit from an internal light,four stars
4.0,i am terrible at reading directions so i sort of perused the instructions and am fending on my own what ever mistakes i make are my own however so far so good the device is small enough to carry around much like a soft paper back it is so easy to change fonts go home to find other books if i have to go back to another or find the author if someone asks etc the presentation of books is what is throwing me off since i was used to a linear look not books but i will get used to it unless i can change this and i havent noticed how that brings me to the other issue of having my books from the first device i owned in the cloud brought back some titles i remember and others i dontguess i better read the instructions on how to retrieve these items other than these draw backs it is a clear and seamless device as promised glarefree and easy to use,clear easy and it grows on you
3.0,no lit background i thought it was when i bought it,three stars
2.0,my previous kindle a basic with the buttons was far better it was easy to turn pages by simply pressing a button on the edge this one often requires more than one swipe to turn a page the touch screen is also annoying because a slight wrong touch brings up the font size screen which seems to automatically select the wrong font my old kindle kept a list of books i had read not so with this thing i would certainly buy an original from ebay but the battery would be questionable mine swelled and cracked the case,was far better it was easy to turn pages by simply 
2.0,not what expected will pay more attetion next time,two stars
5.0,easier to read than the kindle app for phone and other devices which i intend to keep using and knows where you left off reading on the last device you were reading very handy having all your books togetherhaving the screen never really turn off is a bit unsettling but the battery does last for weeks as they describe so it is ok,easy to read
1.0,my local library offers lots of great ebooks but they are next to impossible to read on my new kindle it is very disappointing,my local library offers lots of great ebooks but they are next to impossible to 
3.0,i actually returned this product because when i had it in my hands i had trouble reading the screen it was too dark for me and with no way to back light or turn up the brightness it just wasnt going to work for me at this time i have vision issues and was hoping to have a kindle that i could read outside but it just strained my eyes too much loved the size and weight though and for those without vision issues im sure its awesome just didnt work for me,did not work for me through no fault of the product
2.0,after finally receiving the kindle i am not sure if i am please as i should be  is stated includes special offers i have not seen any of these and i was looking for a simple case for this and it is too confusing as to what case i need for it i have been very happy with amazon before this order and am hoping that this will not a problem in the future it took 15 days to get this order and that was the replacement that was sent out after the first one got lost from usps cases for the kindle are to many for different versions and not simple to find a basic case for this one i am almost more please with my daughters very first version of the kindle that i have had for 2 yearsthis has been my worse experience with amazon and i hope to not have more in the future,may be more of a hassle that its worth
4.0,i initially purchased this kindle because i had lost my older kindle however i was so pleased upon receving it first i was able successfuly to transfer many of my already purchased stories and books to the new kindle with ease second it fits into my suit pocket and so i am able to carry it without fear of losing it one negative is that the system i must utilize to reach books and stories requires that i go though sales offers every time i did buy a cover which is useful as i occasionally drop it in my condo there is wall to wall carpeting and so that not a problem there but when i go out the cover is very useful i have about 160 stories on the kindle and it will hold many more i highly recommend a kindle for those of us who really like to read this is the best kindle i have owned,best kindle i have owned
1.0,i thought it was going be a simple version of my kindle fire no such thing dull screen not very intuitive very unsatisfied,dull screen not very intuitive
5.0,i received a kindle 5way as a xmas present three or so years ago i was hooked i loved it so much that i bought a kindlefire hdx wifi with 64 gig of memory for my wife she was too afraid to use it but i loved it the resident geni in the box makes it the most of the very best of any tablet of any brand i always have both kindles running at the same time 247 amazons kindle 5way is by far the best for finding and buying books the firehdx is best at reading them for you and a thousand other thingsthe new kindle touchscreen screams plastic and cheap but it has more capacity i have more than a thousand titles any idea how large the catholic encyclopedia is and battery life than the 5way and i swear it is lighter and thinner also amaz0n continues to knock the ball out of the park,how can other companies compete
4.0,it would be perfect if it had a backlight feature,four stars
3.0,kind of disappointing i thought i was replacing my broken paper white model this model does not have any illumination like my old one also i was not able to use my old kindle cover on this model although it appears to be the same size its a bit thicker than my old kindle,disappointed
3.0,at this point every kindle should have self light,kindla glare free no light yet
5.0,i absolutely love this kindle its compact lightweight fits in my hands well and the screen print is dark and easy to read but most importantly its so easy to use the touchscreen makes navigation a breeze believe me if i can do it so can you i tend to shy away from trying new gadgets fearing i wont be able to operate them i neednt have worried with this kindle right out of the box i turned it on and the screen prompts took me through the set up process which took less than 5 minutes i currently have a 1st generation nook that i have loved for years but it doesnt compare to the kindle the nook is larger heavier has more navigation steps the print is so much lighter and sometimes the formatting is off for these reasons im retiring it in favor of the kindle you cant go wrong with this ereader i think youll enjoy it just as much as i enjoy mine,love my new kindle
1.0,bring back the kindle dx global viva big readers,one star
4.0,the kindle prologue is great for anyone who likes to just read and gets distracted by other apps you have on other devices kindle fire ipad etcyou can only read on this deviceno other distractions ie games the only drawback for some and its really not a big deal is that you cant read it in a really dark room its smaller than most tablets very portable and very reasonable in cost if you just want to read this is a good deal,the kindle prologue is great for anyone who likes to just read and gets 
5.0,ive had a kindle keyboard for years and decided to do an upgrade when amazon had their big sale day a few weeks ago and i can say that im really satisfied with the new kindle it is a real improvement over the old kindle i had as it incorporates touchscreen technology and a number of other nice features xray time left in chapter etc that are included in the kindle fire i use at times the battery life is great although not quite as long as my old kindle but still weeks vs days for my kindle fire this is really only a single function device ideally suited for reading and im absolutely satisfied with the way the device accomplishes that task,ideal device for reading books
3.0,it does not read well at night thought ir would,three stars
1.0,returned due to inability to adjust screen brightness,one star
5.0,took me awhile to get used to how to use it and get it set up mainly using caps and non cap letters on the keyboard at first it would do only one or the other and still dont know how i got it to do caps then switch back to small letters this was very much needed when setting it up as the passwords needed to have both but i finally got it to do what i wanted was glad my eldest son was here with his and showed me a few of the ropes though i would have figured it out by playing around with it havent used it too much as i am waiting for the carry case it is a heavy slippery little bugger but nice so far i really like it my son carries his in a hard case and is pretty tough with his obviously it looked pretty dirty but he assured me that in his work truck it may get dirty and banged around but the unit itself was in clean perfect condition i opted against this type of case as reviews said it was hard to get in and they didnt know how to get it back out which my son confirmed,was glad my eldest son was here with his and showed 
1.0,too dim for indoor reading ok in very bright light,one star
5.0,this is our second kindle as we wore the first one out my husband is visually impaired and this product meets his needs and more the no glare screen is perfect and the size and weight make it more usable than an ipad for him we will always have a kindle for him,meets needs very well
2.0,i think the manual should be attached as a hard copy,mannual
5.0,this was an xmas gift for my sister in law who was always borrowing my old kindle keyboard i had the kindle fire and mostly used the kindle keyboard which most know is similar reading as a paperwhite when i read outside as the glare was too much with the kindle fire so she was elated receiving this when i set it up for her she became frustrated with the touch screen because she was used to the keyboard so we switched i love it the touchscreen is easier i think shes not a very techy person the screen is totally antiglare indoors i havent had the opportunity to try it outside yet its winter here but im sure its going to be fantastic i would recommmend it to anyone looking for a basic kindle as with a regular book you will need adequate lighting to see this does not come with any back lighting you can spend more money on the backlit version or just use a book light on the rare ocasssion you may need oneits simple to use very easy to set up and navigate i got mine on sale but even at full price its worth it,love it
2.0,returned could not figure out how to make it brighter,returned
5.0,just what i needed i do not read outside i have the first kindle which was much larger and i dropped it and part of the screen would not displayso when this became available at a discount i bought it with no ads and just the wifi it is perfect for me i also bought a cover that fits nicely and turns off the kindle when i close the cover if you are looking for something to replace having to lug a book or even a paperback around this kindle is ideal and with the ability to order books online is a plus inexpensive and good investment,easy to read and inexpensive
3.0,it shipped fast but not exactly what i was expecting,it shipped fast but not exactly what i was
4.0,i wish there was better light options then the clumsy clip lights maybe a little pop up light would be good right handed people will get seriously annoyed in landscape mode because youll want the wide part in your palm but it only turns 90 degrees right instead of the left also would really recommend a cover since it scratches very easily i think its significantly better to read on this than an ipad fire or any non paper white display,price and ability is great but
1.0,i have still not successfully downloaded any books there are not enough options on the tool bar to choose from its useless to me,its useless to me
5.0,i had been curious about the kindle for a while since i like the concept of ebooks but reading on my android tablet was not comfortable the ereader is light the ink is clear and my eyes are not strained i am looking forward to reading many books and other publications on my kindle,very satisfied
1.0,it only work for a week and frozestore would not exchange it even know i had the box could not find reciiptnever buy a kindle again,kindle 6 touch
1.0,up until now i was truly a kindle lover but yesterday after my third kindle crapped out shortly after the one year warranty period ended i have had it the amazon representative i chatted with last night was so kind to offer me a special value price for a new kindle of only 7900 regular price is 9900 wow what an incredible deal i spend lots of money downloading books from amazon but i think i am done i do not believe in paying for extended warranties on products it is a money making scheme i am very disappointed that amazon does not reward its loyal customers i would have more respect for them if they would replace a kindle free of charge or at a truly reduced rate for loyal kindle users if you are new to kindle save your money and invest in an ipad they do not stop working after a little more than a year…,i am very disappointed that amazon does not reward its loyal customers
2.0,much smaller than i expected have not used it yet,kindle
4.0,great little kindle love the size and the reading screen but absolutely shocked to find the kind of adds popping up on the bottom of the home page and then the recommended reads are you serious wet girls picture book i bought this for my 9 year old and its ridiculous that even on a reading devise she is exposed to completely inappropriate things all i wanted for her was to have something to read her good reads on does anyone know how to block these things,great little kindle
3.0,i should have ordered the kindle with the back light,three stars
5.0,i have not had any problems with this one at all i love it it is easy on your eyes and is small so it doesnt take up much room in my purse or bag it does require you to be in a well lit room but led arent good for our eyes anyway so what are you waiting for  go grab one of these today you wont be sorry plus you can buy books right from the device or download your favorite you have saved on your computer either way it is a win win situation ,super duper win win here
5.0,i bought this for my 8 year old daughter who loves to read its so easy for her to use this kindle a big plus was that a library near us lets us rent ebooks for free online so she can keep getting books for it without having to pay too much the kindle book prices on amazon are usually only a dollar or 2 less than the paperback books so thats a con but other than that this device is really helpful for kids she can take it on trips with us and have 20 books available at once without the weight of carrying them all or read it when shes laying in her bed shes really happy with it,its so easy for her to use this kindle
3.0,getting sometime to getting use to the version of kindle,three stars
1.0,screen is to dark to read without a bright light beside,one star
5.0,i have the previous version without touchscreen my bf wants a kindle and this new edition comes out he got it and thinks it is much better than my nontouchscreen one i guess so so much easier to navigate with this one only thing i think the old version is better is that the older version is thinner and lighter this is a little bit thicker it is a little harder to hold it in one hand for me but than again touchscreen makes navigation so much easier cant beat that,he got it and thinks it is much better than my nontouchscreen one
2.0,it keeps blinkin in and out like it turning off and on,two stars
5.0,this newer kindle reader replaced my 2nd gen model you may be asking what was wrong with that one nothing at all i handed that one off to my wife when she started highjacking it to read her own books i gave up switching account logins and fighting over reading time and got the better end of the deali bought this newer model and i love it this has touch screen features with the lauded noglare screen this newer model is about the size of a standard paperback book only thinner i use it almost everyday,this newer generation kindle is wonderful
5.0,bought two of these for christmas hope they like them,great black friday deal
5.0,omg love love love the 6 size fits right inside my purse great for reading on the go as i so often do i have a larger reader but now i actually prefer this smaller kindle has all the features as my larger one but so easy to carry from point to point cant wait to take it on vacation thank you amazon for this smaller version of the ereaders,6 so easy to carry love it
1.0,i wont use it it is grey on grey and impossible to see without a strong light i wish i could exchange it for a bigger lighted version so its back to my nookalso staples still has not sent my rebate card,unhappy
5.0,i had a fire hdx and the screen was way to bright to read for long periods of time my eyes would hurt and i would get a headache i like to have an ereader but wasnt able to read much with it then i decided to get this one i love it i can read for longer periods of time i no longer get headaches my eyes dont hurt i like that you can change the font size and the font it is a pretty basic reader it is not back lit there are no speakers there is no reading light attached it is exactly what i wanted i got a regular book light for the store and it works perfect it fits in my purse and is super light weight yet feels sturdy the back has a rougher surface so it is not slippery to hold if you do not like reading from a computer screen or get eye strain from other readers get this you wont regret it,perfect simple e reader
2.0,the kilndle i bought has paperwritre i did not know,without paperwrite
5.0,the refurbished one i received was in perfect condition and works great i cant believe people complain it doesnt have a built in light if people read the description they would know what theyre getting this is my second reader and its light weight and easy to read outside in bright sunlight i couldnt be happier,highly recommend
4.0,i wish you could adjust the brightness of this kindle,four stars
4.0,i have been using the kindle app on my ipad to read books but with limited memory i figured i should buy a kindle i like it but the format took some getting use to i had it for less than a week before i sent this kindle reader back realizing that i need more light to read by i bought the kindle paperwhite instead,good but some getting use to
3.0,i misunderstood and thought i could see pictures in color on a kindle only gray scale its great for reading but not what i expected,its great for reading
5.0,i really like this base model kindle i have lights installed over my bed for reading and good lighting elsewhere in the house so there is no need for the more expensive model the type is clear and distinct and battery life with this model is exceptional especially with the wifi off i download all my books off wifi at home so no need for 3g i have an iphone 6plus which holds a similar amount of words per page using the kindle app so i can download books to that as well and read on the iphone in the few instances i need a lighted screen,i really like this base model kindle
1.0,on and off button confusing i inadvertently touched the french language and there was no way to reset or get out of it since the instructions given were in french i found the amazon help did not have much knowledge on this unit the interface on this model is poorly design i am returning this unit in the french language mode very very disappointed a loyal and amazon customerps i was considering buying the kindle paper white in its place but decided not to since it may have the same interface problems i will wait a few years until the issue is resolve before buying one,very very disappointed a loyal and amazon customer
5.0,thanks to numerous back problems i have to lie down a lot this makes reading actual books awkward at best especially with reading glasses digging into the side of my head i finally broke down and got a kindle and i wish id done so sooner the kindle is really lightweight and comfortable to hold whether youre lying down or sitting the screen is easy to see even when its flat on a table i like that this kindle has no backlighting because i mainly read at night and i find that computer lights keep me wide awake half the night being able to choose a font size is a definite plus no need for reading glasses as is being able to look up unfamiliar words and characters that i totally forgot about even when they are only one chapter back i almost got an ipad to use for reading and im really glad i got the kindle instead its the perfect size for reading and it doesnt have that computer feel to it plus i can take it anywhere,so glad i finally bought this
1.0,this is my 5th ereader and the most difficult to us,one star
4.0,good battery life easy to carry good value let me repeat what many other reviews have said this ereader does not have a backlight it is clear and easy to read outside but if you are looking for a device to use in low light or bedtime reading you should select a different model i use the kindle app on my samsung tablet for reading indoors or in low light through wifi the devices synch up and remember your place so transferring between devices is easy,good value
5.0,i love reading and this makes it so much more convenient and encourages my reading even when im busy it allows you to highlight and take notes you can look up any word you come across on a built in dictionary and wikipedia you dont need to buy books online because you can drag the files on the kindle if say you borrowed an ebook from your library or found an old classic available as an ebook online the screen is visible and matte with no glare ultimately id say well worth it if youre looking for something to just read on with no apps or extraneous functions,i love reading and this makes it so much more convenient 
5.0,ok,five stars
5.0,ok,five stars
3.0,it is enough different from the older model that it takes some time to learn its operation we found it touchy in that one can get unexpected subwindows unexpectedly by touching either the top or bottom of the screen once one learns that these areas are where the menus are brought forth it is easy enough to avoid while advancing or paging back the screen is very sensitive so that it is easy to skip pages a disadvantage is that there is no indication of what percentage of the book is read or what page is on screen the idea of minutes remaining to read the chapter on screen is of little value learned one neat advantage of kindles i have two if reading a book on one and switching to the second the option of going to the page being read is made possible really an appreciated feature all in all the new touch screen model is ok easy to use once mastered and holds a charge for a long time,new kindle 6 is ok
3.0,i dont know how to work this thing so its still in the box,three stars
4.0,my first generation just died i read many wonderful and many terrible books on it i recently replaced it with this one i like it because i have the convenience of so many books at my fingertips my only complaint is that its a little bit on the thicker side and i know this is old fashioned but i liked the old qwerty keyboard and page flipping side buttons touch screens are sleek and high tech but i feel like good old buttons are more reliable but this is a fantastic product despite my old fashioned notions,i miss my first gen but this is great
1.0,no there wasnt any special offers but i do like the device,but i do like the
5.0,i bought this for my daughter who with the holidays has not had a lot of time to use it i thought i would check it out for her so i could give her some pointers when she had time to search the offerings of titles i found a series i was very much drawn to and ended up buying the first book in the series for 000 the other four books are ones i can borrow using the prime features well you cant beat that with a stick as my great grandmother used to say i have also found several stories i only looked through the first 35 titles my daughter can borrow for my granddaughter who is 7 i have no fear of any similar titles to childrens literature that is anything but for children getting viewed because of the ability to create a child safe reading environment with password controls i have to say thanks to amazon for providing such an extensive lending library also looking at the prices of books for purchase all that i looked at were less than half the price of a new bound book if you love to read but cost and the sometimes awkward visual book coverstitles keep you from your love of reading anywhere and everywherethis ereader is the maker of your dream come true,as my great grandmother used to say
1.0,does not have a light removed the option for a case that has a light i would have bought the paperwhite if it had been clear that this did not have one,does not have a light removed the option for 
5.0,i was expecting less from the least expensive of the kindle line but was presently surprised i just wanted a kindle to read not play games check my email or anything else i wanted something light to carry and easy to get the books i wanted to read this little kindle does it all and its so easy once you set it up wifi and one click payment be sure you edit the payment information before you purchase something i am rediscovering reading again for fun,back to the basics for good old fashioned fun
3.0,i would like it to have a light to see the writing better,three stars
3.0,i really thought i was upgrading from my kindle keyboard when i purchased this item while the touchscreen is responsive and its easy to reading i realized that in this item i gave up one of my favorite features of my previous model audiobooks no speakers no place to plug in head phones i use public transportation to get everywhere and having the kindle out to read is not always an option but i could always pick it right up with the audiobooks well no more im greatly disappointed to the point that i am contemplating returning this item so i can use the funds to go purchase a used prior model with audio,not the upgrade i expected
2.0,have not been able to load any of the games which my wife has on her kindle which is 2 years olderwhats with thatcant figure,7th generation whats the point
5.0,great kindle perfect size responds well to touch and i havent missed the 3g4g connection at all adjustable fonts make it easy for anyone to read but if you do need large font super large a bigger kindle might be better for you i have found the screen and background to be perfect i havent tested its durability against drops or scratches but normal wear and a few drops on carpet a couple times from about 4 feet up and on tile a couple time also from about 4 feet and have not noticed any malfunctions in the 4 months i have had it work well outside and in very portable and holdable doesnt stretch my hand at all i havent put a case on mine and havent really missed it the price is definitely the best youll find for such a great ereader,another great kindle
3.0,very disappointed in not being able to read in low light,three stars
5.0,i have a kindle fire and i like this sooo much better from a ereading stand point on my fire you cant create collections and i am a very organized person i have all my books organized my author and series and its so light the only downside is that it is not back lit so you cant read it in the dark unless you have a reading light which are really easy to come by and super cheap just find a case that you can clip a light to and it becomes a non issue,i have a kindle fire and i like this sooo much better from a ereading stand point
3.0,i didnt like the fact that it doesnt have a back light,no back light
5.0,just got my 6 touchscreen paperwhite kindle yesterday already loving being able to read without the screen shining in my eyes amazon shipped it already set up for my account so it was just a matter of turing it on and running through a simple setup menuei can read outdoors again something ive missed using a tablet with the paperwhite screen the brighter the light the better the screen shows upultra light clear high contrast print pocket sized better than a book when you are on the go,paperwhite 6 kindle the base model

3.0,i found it hard to use the only feture i liked was it was lite, found it hard to use the only feture i liked was it was lite
5.0,absolutely love this kindle i have a kindle key board which recently stopped working and a kindle fire which i dislike for its weight this basic kindle is perfect its light weight and not the least bit bulky making it a pleasure to carry in purse or work tote my suggestion is if you want bells and whistles choose a different model if you want an easy to use basic ereader this is the perfect purchase,pleasure to use
2.0,im pretty disappointed in the kindle i purchased as it doesnt have a backlight my wife reads at night before bed and has to have the bedside lamp on to use it,no backlight not meeting expectations
5.0,i got my new basic kindle last week and must say i am really enjoying it after reading some of the reviews i wasnt sure what to expect i have had many tablets including kindle fire ipad and nook tab4 the back lighting on all of these was really bothering my eyes this traditional kindle is perfect i am an avid reader and the type is very crisp you can easily adjust font size and i love the fact that you can easily categorize each book much easier than on tablet the best thing ive noticed too is now i am not so distracted as i was on my tablet with email and other notifications going off this model is so nice and smooth in each task i choose whether going to next page amazon store good reads or adjusting settings whispersync is very fast i highly recommend this ereader ,a wonderful ereader
3.0,have not used it yet going on a cruise will try it then,have not used it yet going on a cruise will 
4.0,nice little appliance fits in my inner coat pocket this is my first kindle and its great 4 stars is the most i ever give because i deduct a star for any payment i gave i only give 5 stars for free stuff ,nice little appliance fits in my inner coat pocket this 
4.0,pretty much as expecteddont like the swipe to open tho,pretty much as expected dont like the swipe to open
5.0,i love to red on this my son thinks he reads faster because he doesnt lose the page or have to turn pages me to i bought the one with ads to get the cheaper cost and do not find them annoying at all oh and it is my second kindle i think the first was stolen from my office admittedly after i left it on my desk when i left one night,love my second kindle
1.0,not able vet other books then amazon in the reader very cheap,one star
3.0,so this review wouldve had 5 stars except i wanted to alert those people whom are gift givers like me to beware because the kindle devices automatically link to your amazon account i gave two devices for christmas and then after the gifts were given i returned home to find that i have emails that i have purchased books and signed up for book clubs on my 2 new kindle devices not cool amazon you should be required to register your device on your own and it should not automatically be linked with an amazon account i have deregistered both devices and am hoping this is the end of it,buyer beware
2.0,didnt pay attention and bought this model without the light feature if you arie considering buying this product do pick the model with the light built it is totally worthy paying a few more bucks,didnt pay attention and bought this model without the light 
5.0,i broke down and purchased this kindle after hemming and hawing between it and the paperwhitethis is a terrific device i can hold it comfortably in my hand for long periods of time the light issue isnt a big deal to me which is why i didnt splurge the 40i wanted a device to hold the many ebooks i review instead of using a tablets screen once you purchase an ebook though its a challenge to justify the more expensive paper books,ive converted
5.0,😊,😊
4.0,this is a great ereader and does a great job for the upgrade but i was having a problem with reading in darker lit rooms so i opted to return this one and get the paperwhite which i love it has everything this one has to offer but the backlight allows me to read no matter where i am worth the extra money,great but no paperwhite
4.0,4,in need of cover
5.0,im a simple person and ive fallen in love with the simplicity of my kindle i would have loved a back light but other than that i bring it everywhere i go its lightweight and doesnt drag my purse down and i have unlimited books anywhere its easy to navigate on and love how i can purchase a book on the app from my phone and sincs to my kindle with wifi one of the best purchases ive ever made definitely beats buying a new book every week and trying to find somewhere to store it,love it a great and very smart purchase
4.0,no,four stars
5.0,i wanted a reader that i could take out to the pool and read this works perfectly you can read it even in the bright texas sun perfect my only beef is not with the reader but the cases available for the readernot one case sold for the reader will stand on its own really need a case that will fold into a stand,perfect reader
4.0,first im not the most familiar person when it comes to the kindle devices with this kindle at first glance it looked weird felt weird it really is as light as a feather and it took some getting used to esp since the only kindle ive ever used was the fire now that ive used it a little i really like it the kindle fire is nice if you want a tablet but for reading books as your primary focus it is just too bulky this kindle is easy to handle light and easy to transport it seems perfect to carry in a backpack or take camping due to the small size if youre a female you could prob carry this in your purse with no problem ive seen bigger things pulled out of a womans purse lol the only thing i notice in my opinion it seems a little harder to read in the dark then the fire maybe there is a setting for this i think i will buy a light for it though overall if you are looking for a light kindle without the bulkyness of the fire this is highly recommended,now that ive used it a little i really like it the kindle fire is nice if you 
4.0,i miss the plain book only kindle that is larger than this new one,four stars
2.0,i thought it had a light so i can read in the dark and it doesnt,two stars
4.0,i have always like the feel of a book in my hands and figured i would not get use to a kindle my wife has had one for several years i purchased one on a wednesday and took it on a long weekend trip reading on the plane was so easy so was the beach and by the pool i would recommend that the first book you read is an author that you know you will like,i have always like the feel of a book in my hands and 
5.0,nice and lightweight helps me get through the backlog of books,five stars
3.0,i cant say that i love this new e readermy old kindle is the best and i still find myself using it i purchased this to see whats new well not muchi hate turning pages and dislike all the other newer ways to find thingsguess im old fashioned and i say if it aint broke dont fix it,not impressed
1.0,almost 1 week passed that i sent itbut you didnt inform me yet,one star
4.0,great way to read your books on the go the display never hurts your eyes your reading experience is fully customizable and thanks to the 4 gb internal storage you probably wont need external storage devices adding books from amazon is extremely simple and books from other sources can also be easily uploaded provided the format is correct the device does not accept epub so make sure your books are saved as pdf what really helped me immerse myself in the reading experience was the vocabulary builder all words you search in the dictionary are store and every now and then you can pop over to see how many words you remember searching a word in the dictionary is also easy just tap it setup is quick weight feels just right and the home menu has the perfect design,great way to read your books on the go
2.0,the problem with this one is that it does not have a backlight the contrast on the print cannot be changed for the setting the writing on the background is grey,the problem with this one is that it does not 
5.0,exactly as advertised very easy to use and read despite being the cheapie model get this one with advertising on it and save the 20 the book advertising is only on the wallpaper screen when the unit is inactive,love it
2.0,it came without light is it that way or can i have a new one,two stars
5.0,kindle 6 glarefree touchscreen is awesome i have trouble holding on to things that are weighty and bulky with it being so slim is great and easy to use just turn it on and then touch the screen to get what you want reading is a snap and can also do it one handed i would so recommend this for anyone,greatest product of kindle
1.0,it is mandatory to have a light over you to be able to read it,a printed book is more brighter
5.0,we bought this because my sons could not follow rules with apps and wifi i used parental controls and time after time they figured out the code or reset the kindle etc so my one son lost it for good however we use kindle books for school all the time this was the solution he had to buy with his own money and it has nothing to get him into troublei wish i started with these and we never brought the apps into the house oh well this is a great kindle do wish it lit up but i knew it didnt when i bought it and the price was perfect so no issues therei recommend this for the younger kids especially to keep inappropriate apps out of their lives fyi the ads on the apps are my biggest concern,great kindle for reading which is what we wanted
1.0,difficult to navigate i was used to ease of my first 2 kindles,disappointed
3.0,i really like my old first gen better although the screen size is the same the screen is touchy and there are fewer places to put my hands without ending up accidently highlighting something or altering the print size or equally distracting things when all i want to do is read not screw around with mistouches,i really like my old first gen better
1.0,not bright poor contrast difficult to read in moderate light,hard to read
5.0,i just took my new kindle out of the box and im already in love with it setup was rather easy and the tutorial was easy enough to follow along it didnt take long for me to get it up and running so i could finally read a book on it,from a new kindle owner
1.0,gave this as a gift and my friend is having problems with it,not impressed
5.0,i love this kindle is so easy on my eyes that ice read two books in a week the battery life is amazing ive charged it once when i received it a week ago and its still going while i only use it about 23 hours a day i think the claims about battery life are spot ongreat product bought it on sale for only 5900 and im very impress by it while i will be passing this one on to my 9 year old as soon as the paper white goes on sale again i highly recommended ,love this device
5.0,i had the paper white 1st gen the screen stop working after 2 years so i got this to replace it i thought i would miss the built in light and to tell you the truth i dont this kindle is just as good as the paper white but it is cheaper i repeat there is no built in light you dont need it now if you had to read at night with the lights off than you can buy a light or you could get a case with a built in light of you want to spend an extra 40 this feels more sturdy than my last kindle you dont need a case to protect it i have a feeling this will last much longer than my last kindle,get this kindle not that one
2.0,its not what i expected i wasnt really impressed with this product,its not what i expected i wasnt really impressed 
1.0,had a couple of years always left it home because l liked my nook better about the tenth time i charged it it died tossed it in the trash my nook which is years older still works fine,kindle no good
5.0,this unit replaces my original kindle its a great product once you learn how to use it they should include a printed list of shortcuts to help you get started i had to keep calling tech support they gave me the feeling that i knew more than they did to solve problems that i could not find answers to on kindle tutorial it was a frustrating 2 days for this engineer who was at the beginning of the solid state revolution in silicon valley,great but
3.0,what happened to the backlit display i had on my previous paper white,three stars
5.0,i love this glarefree touchscreen display because i use it outdoors all the time i love being able to read it in the bright sunshine as i live in florida and it is usually very sunny i also take it to the beach with me,i love this glarefree touchscreen display because i use it outdoors 
2.0,sent back didnt have light was for my mom who has eye sight problems,two stars
5.0,ive been hearing a lot of comments about the kindle from my friends and family i was finally convinced on buying one for myself i was a bit skeptical about it at first being the kind of reader who prefers the actual book in hand be it soft or hard cover but my view changed when my first kindle came in the mail and tested it outi have had this for almost three weeks now and i am happy to say that i am glad that i bought it it is easy to use allows me to log onto amazon to browse through a selection of books and i am by far loving the kindle unlimited it also saves me room in my bag for when i need something to do to pass time while out of the house and its light toobeing a new kindle user there were a lot of functions that were strange to me but eventually got the hang of it as this kindle has no actual page turning button as i thought it would the fact that theres no glare when i read it under a light makes me love it more and satisfied the battery life great,first kindle user and loving it
1.0,i hate touch screensi liked the older models i own 4,not so good
5.0,love these simple to use kindles i am technology challenged they are extremely easy to use i also have vision problems can make the font xl not so wfire6 i ordered on sale i cannot make font big enough plus my vision did not work well wcolor brightnessalso love long battery life,love these simple to use kindles
1.0,its useless to me since it came largely devoid of the books i had previously purchased on the kindle that got lost i cant find a way to get the new device registered or linked or whatever it takes to get continuity previous replacement kindles came already containing my library i need help and im having problems finding itup until now when i bough a replacement kindle for one that had broken or gone missing it came with my library of previouslypurchased books already installed have you changed that policy or did someone drop the ball ive been trying to get hold of someone to help me for weeks now but to no avail who am i supposed to be talking tojim sower1960 bell rdcrossville tn 385719315103338jimsowergmailcom,its useless to me since it came largely devoid of the 
5.0,i have owned several kindles over the past few years most of which i have given to friends and family recently i realized i had given away my last kindle paperwhite to a friend so back to amazon i went to get another when i saw this particular model on sale i bought it immediately it arrived well packaged and two days sooner than predictednow ive read a couple of reviews where people had trouble switching the language when the kindle first arrived charge it up first i had the same trouble before i had the forehead smacking moment of duh you need to charge it first once done i had no troublemy only complaint and its not even really that is that this particular model is not back lit no real issue there as i have a clip on book reading lamp that works perfectly well for night time readingmy greatest love of this model is that it is so very light i love that it doesnt hurt my hands to hold it for long periods of time this kindle is perfect for those who travel quite a bit and do not want to be carrying a heavier kindle along its also perfect for those who have trouble holding a book for long periods of readingso remember if you want an ereader that is light weight and easy to use i highly recommend this model just remember if you want to read in the dark either buy a book light or choose one of the other models,my greatest love of this model is that it is so 
3.0,i like the kindle 6 with the exception that it doesnt have a light,three stars
5.0,i love this i never thought id use an electronic reader because i love books so much but the convenience of carrying dozens of books at once in one device won out this is light and easy to use the browser allows me to buy new books from the tabletthe only issue i have is that the power button is on the bottom and when i hold it my finger accidentally hits it on occasion,book lover converted
3.0,it is ok i just cannot figure out how to make the screen light up,three stars
4.0,i bought a 5th generation kindle back in may it was my first ereader i liked it a lot then i saw that the kindle was being offered in a touchscreen i thought i just bought a kindle i dont need to buy the newest model the price was 7900 i only spent 4900 on my first kindle i then realized that i could trade in my old kindle and get a gift card i then saw the touchscreen kindle was being offered for 4900 on black friday i could not pass this up i got my new kindle last week and i love itthe touchscreen did take a little bit of getting used to after a day of use i found i liked the touch screen better than the page turn buttons i found highlighting to be a lot easier this kindle actually highlights the passage instead of underlinei love the new features on the touch screen kindle i love having goodreads right there on the menu i use goodreads all the time and it is much easier to update what books i am reading i really love the page flip feature so that i can go anywhere in the book and not have to constantly turn the page and lose my place the new about this book feature is great since you can mark the book currently reading on goodreads it also tells you if the book is part of a series xray this book is a good feature because you can go to the dictionary and wikipedia without leaving the book the touch keyboard is a lot easier to use than the old kindle writing notes is a lot easieri had very few problems with the touch screen kindle the main problem was getting all my books transferred onto it i had some books on my old kindle that i transferred with a usb cable so they were not on the cloud i could not open the books so i ended up having to rebuy two books the cloud and the device sections took some getting used to i have a lot of books i borrow from the library and they show up on the cloud some books have the loan ended so i had to make an archive collectioni wish the touch screen kindle had more font choices on the old kindle you had a lot more choices i like times new roman san serif i like the plainness of iti am very satisfied with my touch screen kindle for now i might in the future trade it in for a kindle fire,the new kindle is awesome
1.0,i received my kindle 6 in may and have spent the past two months trying to find someone who could help me use it i think i received a demonstration kindle because i have never been able to get past the demonstration part when i just checked today about returning it for another the message said i had missed the return by date very frustrated,i received my kindle 6 in may and have spent 
5.0,i have had a kindle for about 45 years the one with the keyboard i love it and was very reluctant to switch to this new touch screen kindle it went on sale and a friend had decided to get it for me for my birthday i have to say i did not want it i was happy with what i had however after i used it i was in love the things you can do on this amaze me you can look everything up while in text i can see the characters and read about them and as a history guy it helps that i can look things up via wikipedia right on the ereader i absolutely love this so much better than my kindle i had before,didnt want to upgrade but glad i did
3.0,it was a gift im disappointed that it isnt backlit as expected,dont buy if you want to be able to read in the dark
4.0,ive had this version for 2 weeks now still on the initial charge on battery a bit different than the paperwhite but the os is the latest 5621i personally chose the smallest helvetica font with the least amount of margins i dont have to flip the pages as often the screen is crisp clear yes if you get close enough you can see the pixels of the fonts and its not perfect if pixels bother you you may want to consider the new voyage which has a 300 dpi resolution storage has been upgraded to 4 gb but the os takes up 09 gb i have 31 gb of available storage when it arrived i have about 60 books and 10 pdfs which takes up about 12 gb i dont think the kindle can store thousands of books as amazon claims its more like hundreds of books but propaganda sells i bought one and you may want to,must have for the avid and casual reader
4.0,this version of the kindle is truly glare free and the touchscreen makes it very easy to maneuver through any bookwhile i still enjoy the tactile feeling of holding a traditional book i admit that this device made reading on a plane in bed late at night and on the beach much easier my only complaint was that it cant be read at night without a light found this out on a late night flight when i was unable to sleep however i still would recommend this device its fairly lightweight and quite easy to use all of its features font dictionary library etc with a simple touch,great gift idea
2.0,it is to hard to turn on and off that is the only complaint i have with it,two stars
1.0,its ok not really what i hoped for not sure if ill send it back yet,its ok not really what i hoped for 
2.0,i had my first kindle for almost 6 years before the battery life became an issue my current kindle is having battery issues after just 9 months it will not hold a charge for more than a couple weeks of reading for an hour or two a day if i dont use it for several days the battery still drains i never experienced this with my first one it has been a big disappointment after the experience i had with my first kindle,it has been a big disappointment after the experience i had with my first kindle
1.0,disappointed i was not able to read my first selection of childrens books the text ran off the page at all font sizes secondly it was really hard to find the free childrens books in free time unlimited while i love the gorgeous black and white screen and built in dictionary i generally found the device harder to use that i had hoped going back to the home screen took some learning i was stuck on one book trying to get out for about 5 mins,disappointed i was not able to read my first 
1.0,this is the third kindle that i have bought on which the screen has died the kindle representative to whom i mentioned planned obsolescence said that wasnt the case originally no recompense was offered but after some gentle negotiation she applied a 15 discount to the purchase of the new plain vanilla kindle not that i wanted it at all i liked my old button page turner type and i shouldnt have had to buy another one or the previous dead one or the previous dead one,third dead kindle screen death
4.0,i like this product but cant fine how you can lighten up the background,four stars
5.0,i am very pleased with my new kindle but am stymied as to how to delete books that i have read from the kindle i do not have a problem swiping to turn pages it is easy to read i also like it that i can change the size of the font if need be the only problem is not being able to figure out how to delete from the kindle,almost perfect
1.0,not bright enough and not user friendly i hate all of the ads for books,not happy
5.0,im loving this kindle i had a second generation that finally died but this one is just the right size and i like the ease of page turning and the other option on the touch screen i dont like a back lite screen and its so much lighter than reading on my ipad i would definitely buy another if and when this one should ever go kaput love it,but this one is just the right size and i like the ease of page turning and the other option 
2.0,it was advertised as something for kids and it is not not happy at all,not happy
5.0,this is my first experience with kindle and i really wanted to use it before i gave any kind of review my wife recently used my kindle and it reminded me how pleased i am with this little handy tool there have been some updates that are making it even easier to read the only thing my wife said she would like it better if it had a built in light i guess ill have to get her one with a light now ,my wife likes it too
3.0,i was disappointed my previous kindle reader had a builtin led light that was much more efficient than the separate light i was required to buy if i wanted to read in bed this light does not adequately light the full screen and gets in the way,newer is not always better
3.0,this new model doesnt seem to hold a charge as well as advertised also every time i turn it on the font is a different size i expect it to stay the same as where i had it set but it rarely does it seems to me there are still some bugs to be worked out it is more convenient to use than my old one but will not accept some of the games aps i had on my old one and used all the time my old kindle in addition to loosing the charge quickly will no longer connect to wifi i hope that doesnt happen to this new one,the jurys still out
2.0,the need for an internet connection was not spelled out before purchase,two stars
4.0,i believe im going to upgrade to a paperwhite when they go on sale i like this unit its only a book reader except for the fact you can not adjust the contrast and it impossible to read in a dimly lite area the paperwhite is again only for reading books both units are worthless for any thing else i believe both e readers overpriced i own kinde fire hds which you can get for 10000 plus and you can do so much with them except read books due to the short battery life the weight and the back lite bad on your eyes washed out in sunlight you do need two units one for reading books and one for everything else,works only in well lighted area 
1.0,not happy i had an earlier touch screenit came with sound capability and wifi so you could order kindle books from amazonthe new one has none of these plus it just appears cheap,yuck
5.0,kindle made me get into the reading game i dont like to hold a book and flip pages but i loved how kindle shows me the real reading experience and the same quality as if i was reading a real book i love how it lets me choose different fonts weights and sizes too bad the basic model doesnt have builtin led lightthanks amazon for creating this amazing device,turned me into an active reader
3.0,would prefer to be able to adjust brightness for reading in lower light,three stars
5.0,i love my kindle i received this as a gift and have fallen in love i have never used an ereader and was surprised by the comfort of the kindle and the readability of the device i highly recommend this model i have been converted,excellent gift
3.0,the kindle is small and compact the touch screen is nice but so incredibly sensitive if anything brushes it even a little it changes pages opens things or messes with the page set up in general the page set ups cannot be saved if you bump the page it brings up the font settings and any touch messes them up so they have to be set againit didnt come with an instruction booklet just the one inside the kindle itself which is all well and good except that if its all new to you and you have no idea how to turn it on or unlock it though it only has one button so my deductive reasoning told me that i should just push it it was frustratingi really miss my kindle keyboard it was much easier to highlight and navigate no abstract touches screwing things up or changing things or taking me where i do not want to go,the touch screen is nice but so incredibly sensitive
2.0,i originally had a kindle keyboard gen 2 that i bought back in 2010 for classes as most of my textbooks were in pdf or kindle format it died a painful death last year so i began to search for a new one im physically disabled and my hands dont work very well i only bought this because i didnt couldnt find another option and im beginning to wish i had never bought it the touch display is too sensitive for me and i cant highlight passages its too slippery for me to hold but when the kindles in its case its too heavy for me to hold up for long kindle for pc app is better than this deviceamazon sometimes newer is not better,it died a painful death last year so i began to search for 
5.0,i dont know if i have this one of not i have so many from the button turn page and keyboard to the first paperwhite the next paper white and the small fire and big fire not the big big one cant afford it can you tell i love my kindles and yes love is the word i have different books on all bye the way have given up and dont use the ones with the button pageand key boards kindle how about taking them in for trade on the big fire lol,i love my kindles and yes love is the word
5.0,this kindle was exactly what i wanted my mom broke my previous kindle which was a very basic early model it was a gift so i honestly cant remember exactly what it was i really missed being able to read on the old reader so when i got a gift card for christmas i knew i wanted to get a new kindle i opted for this model because i prefer the nonbacklit screen i have a tablet and i dont need anything fancy i just want to read books which this is great forim glad this is a touchscreen because my previous model wasnt and i got so used to touchscreen phones that i frequently tried to do that to turn the pages anyway occasionally i will accidentally turn the page or pull down the menu if i bump but thats not really a big deal i have brushed hair off the screen without turning the page as well so its not overly sensitive,if you just want to read this is your device
1.0,my paperwhite fails to light upcant read in shadows or dark what to do,one star
5.0,after having spent the last few days playing with my new kindle i am thrilled with the simplicity of the device im no stranger to the kindle and what it has to offer this isin my opinion a very basic model in comparison to the kindle fire model there really arent that many thrilling perks to this one but it works well if you plan to watch videos movies etc then i would go with the kindle fire model or better the 7th generation is clearly more for the avid reader that just wants an ereader the ability to set up collections for your books is easy the download of new books or transfer of advance reader copies via review sites is simply and fast as a bonus the deliver was super fast thanks amazon,clearly a great deal
2.0,i got one of these to replace my kindle keyboard hate it want my keyboard,kindle
5.0,this is my 3rd kindle and i love it this is even nicer than the second one i purchased with the light its easier to use and the price was very good whenever i have an appointment i take my kindle along with me and it makes the waiting time go faster i enjoy the books i purchase and the ones i get to read for free the variety of kindle books is wonderful this is just one reason why i love amazon so muchthanks amazon,great buy
1.0,this was advertised as kindle paperwhite refurbished is not a paperwhite,one star
4.0,love my kindle so easy on my eyes this is my second and thats the reason that i lowered the rating id just had the other for 2 years and am not hard on them it just stopped working i guess im not sure why it decided this is it but i loved it enough to buy a second by the end of the day after using computers at my work and home i darn sure do not want a backlit screen for reading for pleasure,best for my eyes
1.0,there is no light so is very hard to read unless you are near good lighting, is very hard to read unless you are near good
1.0,i read a lot i have worn out the buttons on 3 kindles in the past and lost my last one at the airport so bought the new touchscreen its bad the pages are constantly freezing and im currently waiting for the battery to run down because it wont even let me turn the kindle off to try to reset it the page turn is slow and i am constantly overreading the page turns that is i do when it doesnt read my touch as a signal to define a word usually the or highlight a section of print ive had this less that a month and am serious about returning it gah worst kindle ever,worst kindle ever
3.0,did not read or missed the fact not able to enjoy audible with this kindle,not able to enjoy audible listening with this item
5.0,super light very compact and easy on the eyesfantastic battery lifetouch response is acceptable but do expect a slight delay after a while you get used to itthe screen is crispi bought the special offer version which plays some ads on your home screen but it isnt intrusive and after some time you dont even notice they are thereyou can pack a lot of books into this little guyi recommend itbtw i highly recommend downloading the thirdparty program calibre to help manage ebooks and convert between formats it integrates very well with the device,great value great tech recommend it
2.0,great device but the screen is too dark i exchanged it for the paperwhite,two stars
5.0,excelent first kindle i gave 2 as gift and they area being used intensively i knew this one did not have the backlight and to be frank at night or in low light you need a lamp not critizicing this kindle as it is very clear to see with a lamp just as a book would maybe even better but with all the advantages of being a kindle and carrying many books with you you can also send documents like word or pdf to it via email whic is nice to carry technical papers and manuals with you it is light small and easy to hold up for extended time highly recomended for the avid reade and traveler consider the model with light if you are like me and read mostly at night,excellent first kindle if like me you read a lot at night consider the model with light
2.0,i should have more options of free books and little increase in brightness,two stars
5.0,i love it i purchased this as a black friday huge deal as a why not test and couldnt be happier i am a public transit user and this is so much simpler than lugging a book around not to mention the ease of borrowing free books from the library without having to go to the library theres no back light and no keypad but i can download and read books which is all i ask for,perfect for me
5.0,great reader that is easy to use and just the right size for easy carrying,five stars
5.0,i didnt get the two year protection in the mail it was mailed in october the kindle is wonderfuli have questions 5hat i dont know where to go for answers please help me with these problems,kindle is exceptional i do have other concerns
2.0,returned it you just simply can not see it get the front lit paper white,cant see it when its dark
4.0,i bought this because my beloved old kindle kb finally died and i wanted a reader that i can see in the sun sitting out by the pool on our vacations my hdx is more difficult to see under sunny conditions i am kind of disappointed in the touchscreen display on this one its very sensitive and the edge is pretty small and i have small fingers so i am constantly hitting the screen and inadvertently turning the page its kind of awkward to hold it without touching the screen at all i vastly preferred the old style with the page turning button on the side that said for the price it will do the job i bought it from another vendor on sale and with a rebate,dont like the touchscreen
4.0,this is contradictory but i like it and yet i wouldnt buy it again it has great battery life loads quickly and is lightweight my two problems with it are that there is not in my opinion adequate screen contrast and i wouldnt buy another reader that didnt have a color screen the contrast issue is simply that i need a whiter page color and a darker text color to read easily my only problem with it being black and white is that i find it very difficult to distinguish books in my library because i cant read the covers easily i have 3 kindles the fire love it but it is heavier bulkier and has a much shorter battery life paperwhite hate it it wont stay on and freezes up after much troubleshooting with amazon i just gave up on it and the plain kindle lovehate relationship,pros and cons
4.0,i loved it but the free shipping disapired but the ebook meet my expectations,four stars
5.0,rudimentary reader but what i wanted the screen needs to be shut down after use or an image remains i am not sure if it hurts the battery i have not used this much as yet but i am hoping for a long battery life so i can read in airports and on trips without trying to find an outlet every two hours like i need to with my phone or ipad there is no screen light so it is like a book you cannot read in the dark you need a light to see the screen it is light a little big for a pocket but thin and easy to carry beets carrying around a book or a few when travelingit is a book readernothing else,but i am hoping for a long battery life so i can read in airports and on trips without trying to find an outlet every two hours
3.0,this is a replacement for my original kindle which id lent to a friend who lost it i havent tried it as yet although i did buy a cover for itwhich is quite nice it even has a sling for my stylist  it is a new generation of courshowever i love my kindle fire which ive had for a couple of years i hope all the books i had on the original kindle are all on the firenot sure about that as i tended to use them both,replacement kindle
4.0,this is my first e reader i love my basic kindle its easy to maneuver and the touch screen makes the page turning very simple i love being able to change the font size and adjust the paragraph spacing this allows me to read without wearing my eyeglasses im happy with my decision to get the kindle basic for 7900 rather than spending an extra money on the kindle paperwhite for 119 i did a comparison and it looks like they have the a lot of the same features except the kindle paperwhite has a background light my lighting solution was to purchase a 5 book lightmy only complain is every once in awhile the screen freezes and i have to reboot my kindle at first i didnt know what was happening but i went to the kindle support wed site to get instruction on how to fix the problem,the kindle basic is a good e reader for first timers
1.0,this device feels like it was designed for children its only worthwhile feature is its noglare eink whatever the most basic of smartphones renders the kindle obsolete unless you read outside almost exclusively youre better off just using a tablet or your cellphone,this device feels like it was designed for children
5.0,i really enjoy the simplicity of the kindle no buttons and a very responsive infrared touch system made it really easy to use this being the lower end of their screen resolution doesnt make a difference to me still looks great the battery lasts as long as amazon states pretty much forever i read on multiple devices and tend to use the kindle when i dont want to stare at a lit up screen anymorepage turns are fast and boot up as well as application switching are reasonable for the device type it doesnt include a wall charge but you really dont need one considering you barely ever charge it overall very happy with it no more paper for me,great simple device no more paper books for me
1.0,bought this so i could read in the sun it doesnt have a brightness adjuster,one star
5.0,love it this kindle is perfect it is smaller in size than the original one i bought about 10 years ago and of course easier to use due to new technology if this one holds up as well as my first one i will be very happy this one is easier to carry around because of the smaller size,love it
1.0,file browser is extremely inconvenientshould browser files by folders,one star
2.0,just bought my third kindle and am very disappointed that touchscreen versions are the only choices available i was happy with both of my previous versions and was fine with the earlier upgrade a toggle switch instead of keyboard but the touchscreen is making me crazy i have a touchscreen laptop and smartphone so its not that i am against touchscreens in general i just hate it on the kindle with the way it fits in my hand my fingers often slide onto the screen a little too far and boom im on a different article or chapter please amazon bring back some version without a touchscreen the only plus is that the print quality is sharper than ever i am glad that there is still an option without the paperwhite lighted screen as i much prefer this unlit screen option,please bring back a nontouchscreen option
4.0,only trouble with this is there is no light i guess you get what you pay for,four stars
5.0,this is my first kindle prior to using a kindle i read all of my digital goodies on an ipad and as much as i enjoy using my ipad it is not exactly the most comfortable device to use for reading digital articles and ebooks the kindle screen does not strain your eyes the way an ipad or computer screen would after reading incessantly for hours it is also much more ergonomic it is lighter and fits comfortably in ones palms moreover the battery lasts forever all in all it is a much more comfortable and convenient device for those who like to readwhich makes sense since that is the sole function this machine was designed to serve,first time kindle user
2.0,cant see this well without strong light and the back light is not adjustable,two stars
4.0,i knew it was small when i bought it but i still wish it was bigger i would have given it 5 stars then other than that no complaint as promised i also have arthritis in my hands and this makes it easier to read being that it easier to hold than a new book which is tight,good item
1.0,i was soo looking forward to getting this kindle i have decided to start reading again after a way too long hiatus i was very shocked at the size of the kindle as it is only about 1 inch wider and as tall as my iphone 6 i am extremely disappointed at how dark the screen is i did not realize there would not be a back light to adjust i spent a considerable amount of time trying to figure out how to adjust font size as well i finally called amazon and the customer service rep was unfamiliar with the product and kept putting my on hold finally i just asked her to send me the return labels which apparently she didnt know how to do i had to call back and spoke with someone knowledgeable i am still waiting for the return label i will ship this back and try the next kindle that has more features if all else fails i will resort to an ipad mini i really only want a plain reader however,i am extremely disappointed at how dark the screen is
5.0,this is the fourth kindle that i have purchased i like the fact that it can be read without glare when i registered i put it on my old account so i would be able to use books that are already in my archived items now however i cannot figure out how to transfer the many books that i have purchased to my new kindle it says i have only 4 books i have always been very happy with past kindles and i would love to find this one as useful as others i own i am giving this a 5star rating on my experience with past models and hope with the proper help i will be able to enjoy it to its fullest,i like the fact that it can be read without glare
2.0,it was a gift and not what i wanted i wanted a paper white and exchanged it,not what i wanted
1.0,poor skips all the time went back to my old kindle because its less trouble,do not buy this kindle6 glarefree touchscreen display
3.0,glare free screen is very nice but not as easy to navigate as my original kindle,my review
3.0,im still in the process off learning how to use all the features on this kindle,im still in the process off learning how to use 
3.0,i know its my fault for getting the version with ads however i wish they at least turned off after a few hours or so whenever i havent read in a while i come back to a dead kindle because the ads used up the battery lifeotherwise the reading experience is fine figuring out the most comfortable to read using it took a little bit of time because you cant hold it like a paper book but one it was figured out all was good,ads drain battery
1.0,wouldnt connect to previously made amazon account and couldnt create an account,one star
5.0,this is the first kindle i have owned i needed the kindle guide but found it easy to navigate i wasnt sure that i would like the screen but it reads like a book and does not make my eyes tired i have only downloaded two books so far but i am very happy with the results one thing that i was not aware of is that it is in black and white if you are downloading something that is in color like beading books color is very important i got the app and downloaded the beading book in color on my tablet i am really looking forward to taking the kindle on vacation once the book is downloaded wifi isnt neccessary it holds more books at a time than i can read in two weeks i wish i had purchased one sooner,kindle
2.0,love everything except the fact theres no back light which is a huge put off,two stars
5.0,i really like this it is easy to use and carry with me ithas good resolution and i can enlarge or decrease the size of the script have purchased the carry cover for it also good value for afirst time buyer who wants to get the feel of one of these for reading books with out the paper page turning,i really like this it is easy to use and carry 
5.0,amazing,five stars
5.0,my kindle is just the right size and weight for holding without fatigue it truly is glarefree so my eyes dont get tired when i read the ease of downloading books is a huge plus whether im purchasing a kindle book from amazon or borrowing an electronic book from my local library just a few taps and im reading i like mine so much i purchased one for my husband who reads much more now than he used to if youre looking for a basic easy to use ereader i highly recommend the kindle,ereader love
3.0,it is like reading a book you must read it with a light on the screen is dark,three stars
5.0,overall i like it and i think its a great value i got it on sale recently i had an old kindle keyboard that died and was debating which model to upgrade to i debated the paperwhite but i dont read too often at night and if i ever do i could use the kindle app on my phone for me being on a tight budget this device is very good i think i even like it better than the keyboard occasionally i have very slight problems seeing the page in dim light but mostly its very crisp it feels light battery life is good and i like accessing goodreads from my kindle,great device on a budget if you can do without the light
2.0,it did not come with adequate directions still working to get it up and running,two stars
4.0,i have to say i am not a big fan of touch screens i was disappointed the previous generation kindle with the buttons wasnt available this one was its replacement but the touch screen on this kindle is great very responsive my previous ereader was a kobo touch this new kindle is far more responsive than my old kobo was it is a joy to use it will turn on be ready to use within in 12 seconds my previous ereader took maybe 30 seconds to get the point where i could start reading the plastic body does feel a little cheap and clunky but for reading purposes i would say it is great worth the money,simple to use responsive touch screen
1.0,was working great but cant get it to move to home page now what should i do,one star
4.0,this is a really solid kindle that provides great value for the price my wife has an old school kindle the kind with the keyboard built into the body and the arrow buttons to move around oh my is that version incredibly difficult to navigate so its clear the kindle has improved considerably from older models the only real downside to this model is you cannot read when the lighting is low but its a tradeoff i will gladly accept for the great priceif you arent looking for all the bells and whistles and are fine with a bare bones kindle this is a great choice,great kindle for the price
1.0,this case didnt even fit re kindle it was advertised for im sending it back,one star
5.0,i read a lot i use to like carry 3 or 4 books with me to work just not knowing what mood i would be in during lunch this has saved my sanity and my back it took a while to become adjusted to the idea of buying digital copies of books when i got over that i did spend a bit of money to get my favorite reads on the kindle and reread them all again and because the kindle is so comfortable it was like reading them as a fresh experiencethis coupled with kindle unlimited has saved me time and gas as im no longer at the public library every week,i use to like carry 3 or 4 books with me to work
1.0,very disappointed with this was not worth the money at all very cheaply made,one star
5.0,i love this thing easy to hold and read no matter where you are inside or out i weighs almost nothing and can fit in just about any decent size pocketeasy to set up makes reading very enjoyable the screen size seemed small at first but i honestly think it is just the right sizethis is not a backlit model so you cant read in the dark but for all other applications it works just as it should,what a great reading device
5.0,this is an awesome device even in a dark lit setting i can still read the words without squinting its very lite and i can hold with one hand while reading easy to use though im still learning i would recommend it for those needing just a device that allows for reading for a reasonable price and having access to amazons library and the unlimited kindle planfinally there are ads for the cheaper option however they are book recommendations that only appear on your screen saver and bottom of your home screen no way intrusive and worth the 2030 dollars in savings,small easy to read and affordable
2.0,the screen locked up and i had to return it when i reorder i think i will upgrade,disappointed
2.0,returning lighting is very bad unless you always have a house light on very hard to read in the day and especially on cloudy or rainy daysi will try a paperwhite product next hopefully it will be what i expect,disappointed
5.0,perfect for someone like me who wants their phone to just be a phone with texting ability and my computer to sit on a desk and not be mobile i use it to read when i go to the doctors office and arrive an hour before my appt because thats how my medical transportation does things or when in bed but not sleepy and my lady can enjoy my nonpestering companionship while using her laptop,perfect for someone like me who wants their phone to 
3.0,disappointed with no text to speech unaware of this at time of purchase,three stars
5.0,so my reason for getting a kindle is simply to be able to read computer based books without straining my eyes computer screens really hurt my eyes especially when im focused on them for a long period of time to do things like read a bookin that mark the kindle is stellar the kindle is really soft on my eyes making it easy to read for hours the screen is similar to one of those old pda screens which is nice because there is no glare you can easily download your kindle library and do not need to be connected to the internet to use the dictionary and some of the other features it does what its supposed to do extremely well as far as the programming goes it gets a little getting used to and inst the most genius layout the main problem is the texts changing sizes when its brushed against i really wish there was a lock for that also the constant bombardment of adds is also unfortunate also if you have big fingers it will be difficult to learn how to press the menu button and not the top row of words however it serves its purpose well and i highly recommend it as a cheep solution to read computer based books,kindle is really soft on my eyes making it easy to read for hours
3.0,great gift except it doesnt illuminate so it is not usable in poorly lit areas,dont expect to read in the dark with this kindle
4.0,it6s a great machine but i have a hard time in that it has no buttons its all onscreen and tapping i guess thats the current trend im old and i cant catch up to frantic changes in technology my 3d kindle was best fire is too hard for me and i gave it away the first one i bought in 2010 or so had clumsy typing now things are better but slow down techies youre goin too fast  paul simon feelin groovy,it6s a great machine but i have a hard time in that 
3.0,doesnt have a back light and couldnt find a cover with a light to order for it,three stars
5.0,im enjoying it a nice solid ereader that is much better than the older 200 competitionfor reference i got a nook tablet a few years back huge mistake wish i saved my money for this nice streamlined reader with all the features i could possibly need on handmy only regret not getting the one with a back screen,the standard
2.0,i was very disappointed with this gadget it isnt any brighter than previous kindles and it is the devil to use half the time i cant figure out how to get to more than half of my books for my money and i have bought seven kindles though right now i own only five the 3g is far and away the best except for the drive capability of the kindle 1 which allowed the exchange of several different data disks that allowed me to put all my cookbooks on one disk all my pulp fiction on another all my religious stuff on another and so forth if amazon came out with a kindle that had the good points of the kindle i and the good points of the 3g i would dance with joy  and i am 71 and have a bad back and bad knees,doesnt live up to its promises
5.0,6 year old daughter loves it got it because she loves to read shes finishing kindergarten and is already at a 2nd grade level chose not to get one of the kindle fires because i didnt want her using it for games and such she wants to read and ill reinforce that kindle unlimited is a great program that lets her read all the books she wants the public library also has ebooks what this all boils down to is that it is amazing for reading and so easy to operate my 6 year old can do it,6 yr old loves it
1.0,i do not like it so hard to turn the pages iike my old one better dixie schmittp,one star
5.0,price was right this is my 5th kindle over the past 6 years i dont have any need for a fire and consider the battery life of color fire units to be unacceptable i can use my laptop or desk computers for all of those functions i would buy this again but i prefer the paperwhite kindle for low light readingmy amazon prime allows me to utilize thousands of books and i use my smart tv for vidios,good buy for readers
3.0,i hadthe large screen for eight years and loved it tis is fine but not the same,i hadthe large screen for eight years and loved it tis is fine but not the
4.0,i really like this much easier to read than my ipad two necessary addon items a light that clips on so you can read in darker rooms the screen is not backlit so you need to have light to see it and in a dark room you cant see it at all and a cover it really shows my finger prints and stuff i got this on prime day so i got a great deal on it not so sure i would have paid full price for it im ok reading a traditional book,good product
1.0,the lack of lighting makes this very hard to read that is way i am returning it,one star
5.0,this device has brought me back to reading i have asthma aggravated by dust mites who thrive in paper books i had given up my library habit the worst kind of books for dust mite triggered asthma entirely with the kindle and indianas public library access card i can read ebooks from any library in indiana at a low annual fee i am in heaven the fonts are really easy to change so if my eyes are getting a little tired two touches and the font is easier to read book downloads happpen extremely fast and i particularly enjoy the touch dictionary for unfamiliar words and terms thank you amazon,i had given up my library habit the worst kind of books for dust mite triggered asthma entirely
1.0,stopeed working within 15 minutes of purchasing device for an trip disappointed,one star
3.0,i wanted a new basic ereader this device seemed to fit the criteria and the price was right it was easy to set up and connect with amazon i like the different fonts offered on this device i also like the vocabulary builder which remembers all words i have looked up while reading i have 2 older kindle ereaders and am used to buttons to turn pages on this kindle the touchscreen page turning is ok but once in awhile the page turning skips several pages which can be frustrating i took off 2 stars for that because it is a big deal im still undecided if i will keep this kindle or return it,basic kindle 6 inch touchscreen
5.0,wow i bought this before vacation to read on the beach because no tablet or phone or any other e reader is as good as a kindle in direct sunlight it came on friday my vacation started saturday and wednesday was prime day and i saw it was 30 cheaper no problem a less than 10 minute chat with a customer service rep and i had my kindle for less than 50it did not disappoint from a quality angle either perfect viewing on the beach even on the sunniest days lightweight quick smooth performance and i had a new book club friendgreat device great regular price the amazon kindle is still the king of ereaders and this small lightweight beauty is perfect for a summer vacation,prime day made it almost criminal but at regular price it is a steal anyways
5.0,i bought this as a christmas gift for my mother last year and id say she is 100 happy with it she uses it all the timeshe takes it with her everywhere and has so many books to read on iti would recommend this to anyone thinking of getting this for yourself or another book lovermy mom even a year later is over the moon for this thing,mom is over the moon for this
5.0,i love this i can read in the sun and the battery lasts forever i was reading my kindle books on my phone and my tablet but the glare made outside reading impossible and it ate up my battery life this is the perfect alternative i keep it with me all the time and have a book to read no matter what i am doing really good investment,perfect for reading in the sun
1.0,not as user friendly as i had hopedi need to cancel prime account how do i do this,one star
4.0,it has a smaller screen than i would like would have preferred to get my kindle keyboard fixed it meets my needs since i needed something i could use outside which i cant do with my kindle fire i really dont think that amazon should charge more for purchasing one without special offers aka ads it would also be nice if the covers were reusable really how hard would it be to make this and the other kindles to fit in the original covers i ended up retrofitting my old cover with velcro but it does what its supposed to do very well,it has a smaller screen than i would like would have preferred to get my kindle keyboard 
3.0,this is my third kindle and the photos and illustrations are just as poor as the first, kindle and the photos and illustrations are just as poor as the first
5.0,i absolutely love it im a voracious reader never get enough its great fun to stock it with the books i love and it also frees up my ipad for other fun things to do its small enough to be comfortable for reading in bed more comfortable than even a book i can take it with me as it fits in my bag and it holds a charge for so long i still love my paper books but this is a wonderful addition to my library the world is mine i can go anywhere with the written word and do it all from the comfort of my home,a wonderful addition to compliment other devices
3.0,i wish it had a light for reading at night other than that its what i was looking for,three stars
5.0,kindle has allowed me to assessed way more books then ive ever had before great page quality better than my previous keyboard kindle the only con is that i like to read on my bed and my blankets sometimes turn the page or change the font size,very nice
2.0,i was disappointed that it did not have a lighted screen and that i paid for this kindle not knowing that i got the cheaper price because it allows for advertising by amazon which i do not appreciate,i was disappointed that it did not have a lighted screen and 
5.0,this is my 5th kindle the product keeps getting better at this price i think i will start buying them as giftsbest feature not having a browser or other electronic distraction you can actually use it to read a bookother favorite features great readable screen fast page turns lots of customization of reading experience,just right
2.0,i think it is very cheaply made if ii had know how bad it was would have upgraded,if ii had know how bad it was would have upgraded
5.0,i swore id never use an ereader but ive crossed the line ive had my kindle for one day and ive downloaded 2 books really enjoying it ill never give up my actual books but this is so convenient for when im in a hurry for a good read i dont have to wait for a delivery i dont have to run to the store or library also i can download library books to the kindle when they are due back they just disappear from the device love it the screen is glare free and very comfortable to read and operate i didnt get the kindle with the backlight because i figure my actual books dont come with a light and since this was my first reader i didnt want to pay more if i ever upgrade i can give this one to my grand daughter,love it
2.0,frustrated that the backlighting cannot be adjusted like all the other features though,two stars
5.0,i love that it fits in my purse and i can take it anywhere i had a kindle several years ago and gave it to my granddaughter when i bought an ipad i recently bought the 105 galaxy tab s and kept thinking about getting another kindle because the size makes it so much more portable amazon offered a special deal recently and i jumped on it so glad i did i was surprised that it was a touch screen no i did not read the product specs as carefully as i should have if you are looking for a small ereader i would definitely recommend the kindle,love love love my kindle
2.0,there is no light for reading in bed i assumed there would be one can i exchange it,no light
3.0,i bought this device mainly to see what all the hoopla was about i also bought it to see how it works because i am a writer who will be selfpublishing soon and i wanted to see how the user would be reading my book when its published so here are the pros its a good size feels like a small trade paperback in my hands it can hold a lot of books i already have over 100 downloaded onto it most were free to download by the way so heres the cons its dimly lit and theres no way to adjust the brightness from what i can find so if i want to read my kindle device in the dark its tough nuggets everything is in black and white so no way to see the colors on a book cover i am sure higher priced kindles are vastly superior and probably fix all the cons i mentioned but i think that those features should just be basic on all kindles and not just the higher onesif those features are there to begin with its a nice little intro to the world of digital literature but i think amazon could do much better with a product like this,its a good size feels like a small trade paperback in 
1.0,i returned it i was disappointed in it but i am not ver good with these techie items,not user friendly for this old gal
5.0,i had a kindle fire that i used for a few years and i recently decided to get the regular paper white kindle instead for just books and get a samsung tab for internetapps and such i am so pleased with this you can read in the sun no glare and its so much easier on your eyes for actual reading if you are looking for a kindle that you want to use for ebooks only this is really great its almost exactly the same feel as reading an actual paper book couldnt be happier,i am so pleased with this
1.0,it wont connect to the internet within a day of purchasing after connecting for hours after i got it its paper entry a common problem as well i havent called anyone to get it fixed and dont plan to if this is what i spent my money on a broken machine then i have no desire to waist money and time,a common problem
5.0,so easy to use once you know they want the coed of you server and not your password,five stars
4.0,my last 3 kindles were the keyboard type it is taking me a while to figure out how to get to the various settings thank goodness there is a video on the kindle site lack of keyboard does allow the kindle to be smaller and lighter though easier to slip in my purse,my last 3 kindles were the keyboard type it 
5.0,my old reader died a horrible death and i shopped around for a good deal and i certainly got one i like being able to get my books through amazon as i trust them and this reader has lived up to what i read about it and ive found books that i havent seen in years that are available im still learning about the reader but enjoying it very much,my old reader died a horrible death and i shopped around for a good deal 
1.0,i returned it as it not have a light i had a kindle fire before it wasnt at all like it, a kindle fire before it wasnt at all like it
5.0,everyone advised that i get the paperwhite i didnt listen and now i am happy that i didnt this is a great and simple interface no light but i usually read under a light and dislike having a bright book in a dark place contrast strains the eyes the features of the kindle are pretty sweet this is my first ereader i have two different library download sites that my state offers me so i can pretty much get any book for free or cheap i share this with my 7 year old daughter who is breezing through books and it is wonderfuli highly recommend this version of the kindle as it is simply a book with a few great features to make reading that much more enhanced without taking away from it it is the ereader for us bookpeople,ereader for bookpeople
5.0,i like my kindle but ordered a cover that doesnt fit what cover can be purchased for this,no cover
5.0,this has been a most unexpected and pleasurable item to use my kids purchased it as a gift for me i am an avid book lover and never thought i would enjoy an electronic book i was wrong it has been a wonderful gift i use it every day it is also very simple user friendly which is good for someone born before the computer era i would highly recommend it to anyone who loves to read furthermore it is much easier to carry around with me than a regular book please note a simple piece of advice though always keep at least a few books on the devise i made the mistake of only having 1 book on it while out of wifi range when i completed that 1 book and could not download another until getting back into range of a wifi signal i now keep at least 35 books on the device at all times,i am an avid book lover and never thought i would enjoy an electronic book
3.0,it is nice i thought i ordered the one with the backlight my fault  the kindle is great,three stars
5.0,this the most fantastic device i have every purchased from amazon as i get older my eyes are not what they used to be and although i am an avid reader and while i used to base my book selection on author and book title i find myself gravitating toward books with larger type with this and its adjustable type i can read like i was young again i absolutely love it my only complaints are that a the 110 volt charging cord should have been included with it and b the leather case is a ripoff and not worth nearly the price but again as to the kindle itself it is better than watermelons sliced bread and sex what can i say,better than watermelons sliced bread and sex
5.0,good choice because the screen is not backlit so it doesnt keep you from getting to sleep,good purchase
5.0,i wanted another kindle besides my fire just for reading books and where i could have everything downloaded easily i understood the limitations of this versionprimarily no light on the screen so i am very satisfied i got it though staples with a great rebate so i was a really good deal for what i wanted,very satisfied
1.0,did not like it thought i was getting the paper white version so i am returning this one,one star
5.0,i have an ipad mini so i didnt want a kindle with all the bells and whistles of internet streaming movies etc i just wanted a basic kindle to add books to and read from this is perfect fits right in my purse i can pull it out in a waiting room on my lunch break etc it doesnt have a backlight on it so if you must have one you will need to order a different version of kindle this one is there most basic one and it meets my needs just fine,just what i needed
2.0,i bought a light for my new kindle i do not like it at all im trying to get used to it,not too happy
5.0,i have kindle fire which i dearly love however cannot read it in the sunlight so i bought the ereader specifically because i am going on a beach vacation and want to read while i am away this is not my first ereader this is my third the first two having gone to kindle heaven so i know that it is perfect for vacation reading it is light weight holds more than enough books and best of all i can read it in the sun because it is glarefree,why i bought an ereader
1.0,the kindle is a piece of crap it jams up and goes to the same two screens over and over,the kindle is a piece of crap it jams up and goes to the same 
4.0,my wife got this for me for a great price she got some sort of special offer via amazon prime it would be a five star rating if it had all the bells and whistles such as whispernet a colored display and etc i guess ive been spoiled to those things by my tablet for the money it has been great the battery life has been great i had an older kindle model a kindle keyboard and this is a million times better than those the ads arent even intrusive they just show up on the front while you arent looking,so much better than the old kindle keyboard
5.0,i love my kindle and wish i had more books to read the lending library is a little light,five stars
3.0,bought this when it was on sale i knew it was the basic model and thats fine i dont need a ton of bells and whistles and it was my first ereader so i figured this would be a good entry level model i have a few free books on it and have read one i never use it no matter how i adjust things its just not right for me and my eyes,seems nice just not for me
1.0,blurry main page couldnt read hardly anything and it was important to use sending it back,that 6 glare fee kindle sucks
1.0,liked the paperwhite much better unfortunately my paperwhite died after only 14 months,one star
4.0,it was a reader only and i thought i would be able to go on line with it and i wasnt but it wasnt bad,it was a reader only and i thought i would 
2.0,it was very hard for me to read it however i am getting used to it should have researched it more,it was very hard for me to read it 
4.0,this is my first kindle so i didnt know what to expectsurprisingly it is as small as to fit in my mailbox and very light to carryscreen is white and black reading is smooth for the special mobi format or other pdf of good quality not all the books in your computer look good on the kindle page transition looks a little cheap as it takes some ms for the screen to flush and you could observe it i thought i would be a little disturbed by the ads but actually i am not there is no turn off for the kindle as the ad stays there on the screen all the timeoverall i have a useful device which does its job reading goes very smoothly very practical overall,useful device which does its job
3.0,happy with everything it has to offer except it does not work with a cover that has a light in it,cover with light
4.0,this is my 5th kindle i still have the 1st gen kindle and 3 keyboard kindles all of which still work great the only reason i bought this one is because it was offered to me at 29 i couldnt say no so i bought it can anyone ever have too many anyway i am enjoying the lighter weight of it and it works as well as if not faster than my older and very reliable ones,great little device for avid readers
1.0,no instructions with item and no anything to help with understanding the tablet very difficult ,one star
1.0,have two kindles and both were ok but i recently upgraded my network router and they seem to be unable to operate with the latest model dlink ac1750 router all other wifi devices work fine but the kindles cannot connect and keep on requesting you enter a new password over and over and over again kindle support was useless would you like to buy a 3rd one and see if that works i have tried every possible setting on the router including removing all security and even though the router sees the kindles as wifi clients they say they cant connect and i now have to use my phone wifi hotspot to get books would not buy another one,wifi incompatible with dlink ac1750 router
2.0,got this for my mom for xmass she didnt like how the screen was so dark and no light provided,its okay
5.0,love my new kindle it has many many good things about it i love the ability to access from the cloud immediately but wish that when i categorize my books they would disappear from the general list on my kindle only not in the cloud please dont make them disappear from there i do not like to have to go thru so many books over and over again to categorize them i would actually like to be able to put each book into my categories as i buy them is that possible,new kindle in the house
2.0,definitely a downgrade from the original if i was able to get my generation 1 repaired i would,inferior to original
5.0,it charged fast the print is clear and easy to read i enlarge it its easy to use i dont find it to be completely glare free but for the most part it is ive owned a nook simple touch for 3 years using it daily and i like the feel of it better as it doesnt slip through fingers so easy and i like the ability to use buttons as well as touch screen to turn pages the screen is clearer and has less glare then the kindle the kindle charges faster seems to hold a charge longer ive had it for only 3 months and though there are things about nook i like better i have no complaints about the kindle,the print is clear and easy to read i enlarge it
2.0,the kindle 6 seems to be a nice starter but not user friendly for someone that isnt tech savoy,two stars
4.0,i like to read my kkndle while i am hunting deer after reading in a misty drizzle of rain my earlier version of kindle died after arriving back home i immediately ordered a new kindle for my reading pleasure i chose this version because it didnt have a back light which kills the battery faster it was also similar to my previous version so far i like it very much the only reason i gave it a four star rating is because i now will have to use special gloves while reading while i am hunting or i will have to take my glove off every time i turn a page i did enjoy the push button page turner while out in the woods with my gloves on,i like to read my kkndle while i am hunting deer
3.0,replaced my first kendall with this one wi fi on this unit not as strong as my first generation,replaced my first kendall with this one
3.0,its ok and and allows me to read outdoors which i could not do on the ipad however its time that the the paperwhite technology be the standard even in the base model for the price i paid under the special i got value however without the deal this device is no bargain,its just ok
1.0,my kindle broke the day after i got itstill waiting for customer service to call me,one star
5.0,this entrylevel kindle is just what i was looking for something inexpensive to read in bright sunlight with does the job without breaking the bank on yet another mutihundred dollar electronic device you need a booklight to use it in low or no light though,basic kindle does the job
1.0,loved my other two this is a poor example no backlight no color im going to send it back,dont buy
5.0,as you know this is the fifth kindle that ive owned and it rates up there with best of them the only thing that i miss is the color however it has every thing you would want in a handy reader i have transferred bibles books and other reading material to it and find that it is wonderful that i can read from it even in full sunlight it is good to study from and use any where i use it when im teaching or waiting for an appointment etc i find it so handy and so easy to carry with me it is always in my hand,it is the handiest of the kindles
5.0,easy to read easy to get books downloaded its great the noglare factor is the best feature of all i didnt believe it would really work outside until i sat on my patio to do some reading i was truly impressed plus i can actually see and read with or without my glasses,love my kindle
2.0,it is dim i cant see it very well and the type isnt large enough for me to read well i am not happy,i am not happy
2.0,internet explorer is lacking inability to turn on a backlight during low light conditions is frustrating,two stars

2.0,wasnt what i was quite looking for i had one before and really enjoyed it but one is somehow different,i had one before and really enjoyed it but one is somehow different
2.0,no way to make it bright way too small just pointless will be sending this back not at all impressed,overrated
4.0,wish it had a back light,four stars
1.0,the package came i n crushed and the sheet inside was destroyed dont think i would order another one,bummed about my crushed package
1.0,i hate this device the slightest touch sends you places you dont know how to get out of and changes the size of the font and will not let you change it back if you are lucky enough to figure out where the change screen is hiding i cannot see what books i have on the device because the pictures are too dark and the lettering too light i dont know if what i see is what i bought or what you want me to buy because i cannot see what it is i thought i was buying a kindle with a lighted screen but i guess i did not i would really like to return this and just get the original kindle,i hate this device
2.0,was disappointed as thought it had built in light but it did notcouldnt see it very well at all,two stars
4.0,i read lots of reviews before buying this kindle seems like people who have owned prior versions of the kindle do not like this newer version as much as those of us new to kindle but i am a first time kindle user and i am very fond of it i am very farsighted so reading regular books can be rough even with glasses the screen on this is very easy on the eyes and i love the fact that i can enlarge the print the battery lasts weeks on a charge the only real issues i have with it are that the touch screen is sometimes slow to respond and learning to navigate a book in digital format one quick note when you buy accessories make sure you get accessories made for the all new kindle andor 2014 version i bought a very nice case that did not fit lesson learned,first time kindle user and i am hooked
1.0,have nor used it i am not going to spend all that money buying all the things offered instructions suck,have nor used it i am not going to spend 
3.0,i might be a little biased because mine was broken it never would charge properly it was constantly dying but also i realized it not having a back lit screen was a huge issue for me just all around hated it but the return was really easy so thats good,disappointed
5.0,if you do not want lit screen go for this instead for the higher resolution one i bought the higher resolution and own both of them there is not much difference in the quality of the text in real life,no complains
3.0,i bought this because i cracked the screen on my previous kindle my fault i was surprised that this new model was heavier and bulkier than my older kindle from years back i suppose its to squeeze in the touch technology the touch technology is not bad though i do miss the lighter and thinner kindle i used to own but otherwise i use my kindle a lot and i like it,good but surprisingly thickerheavier than my older version
4.0,this is a pretty cool little device i think the kindle books are way too expensive considering what im giving up having the physical book on my bookshelf and flipping the pages but there are enough free books that it makes it worth more plus the ability to read pdfs is very useful as a musician this will come in handy in the future now if i can convince my wife to hand it over,pretty cool little device
4.0,i cant give this neat little device 5 stars i just cant do it it works good enough to do the job but im not blown away i really expected the screen to be more white not so offwhite but it is still very readable in good lighting which is what it is designed for i probably would have wanted the paperwhite model but i really liked the discounted price on prime day so i can live with it the touch screen seems overly sensitive to me and i frequently turn multiple pages by accident and have to find my way back i may have to try a stylus it also seems slow and laggy to respond for everything but page turns once again i bought the cheapest one so i can live with it other than those little issues its a really nice little reader and does everything automatically like downloading and such i like it but not 5 stars worth,not bad for the price
3.0,i was much happier with the previous versioni like the touchscreen in theory but this one is not great the font and text size change every time i put it down very irritating it needs a lock of some sort i wish you could set your own gestures the ones it uses are strange and awkward i have to use both hands to turn a page thats sillyi can choose to read in landscape orientation but only on one side id much prefer the other one and it switches back to portrait when you go to the menu and other areas i find it harder to hold in portrait as it becomes top heavy i really hate that hate itim a bit of a wordy i like reading the dictionary i was really looking forward to the word wise and vocabulary builder feature but found it to be something for children or for people who are still learning the language the first time i actually came across a word i needed a definition for it didnt have one that feature ought to have difficulty settingsi dont hate it but im really disappointed in itit absolutely does everything it says it does but not as well as it should,meh
4.0,very lightweight small easy to read i wish it was backlit so i could read in the dark other than that it is everything i could ask for one thing i wish amazonkindle would is to allow you to move all of the books you have on one device to another with one moveit was tedious to have to move all of my book from my old kindle one at a time to my new kindle just a thought,my new reader
5.0,this is my second kindle i bought the smaller of the kindles and i actually prefer it the first kindle that i bought about five years ago had a keypad on it personally i found that to be a pain in the butt this version has no keypad please be aware that it has no light either it also works via touch and i am much happier with it this way its smaller and lighter and actually fits in my pocketbook without a problem i got it on sale for 40 and am tickled pink with it the charge lasts for days whereas the other one lasted for hours it also holds many many more books if i had the need i would buy a second one i am very pleased,smaller lighter kindle made me a happier customer
5.0,i had one of the old second generation kindles with the keyboard that communicated through the sprint network loved it but then i decided to move up in the world to a tablet specifically a galaxy tab 2 101 and passed the kindle on to my son again i loved the tablet but portability was an issue it was too big to take with me to the store while waiting for my wife whose i just need a couple of things usually means hours so last month when the price came down dramatically i decided to splurge on this entrylevel kindle just for reading purposes i absolutely love it no it cant do all the things my tablet can do but then again neither can my tablet when it doesnt have a wifi connection its small light and easy to carry in my pocket as far as the touch screen that many are complaining about i have no issue with it given that i had to swipe to read on my tablet while travelling for christmas i loved the noglare screen for reading in the car and after dealing with the battery hog that a tablet can be i cant stress enough how much i love the multiple day battery great choice for reading,loved it but then i decided to move up 
3.0,i was disappointed in the product i thought i was getting a kindle fire which i bought on my previous order,i was disappointed in the product
3.0,my mistake but when purchasing this item for my wife i neglected to note that it didnt light up as mine does,my mistake but when purchasing this item for my wife 
1.0,i thought it was the lighted one its too difficult to read and i wish i had gotten the one that is lighted,i thought it was the lighted one its too 
1.0,kindle is great if you dont mind paying for a new one every other year i rarely used mine and half the screen has frozen since it is out of warranty amazon refuses to back up the product save your money and check out other options i wont be buying another kindle,kindle is great if you dont mind paying for a new one 
3.0,cant write honest review upgraded from a keyboard kindle to a touch kindle still learning how to use it,cant write
2.0,real chinsy seems cheap like it wont last long screen shudders and flashes every time i try and navigate,seems cheap like it wont last long
1.0,i did not realize it did not have a built in lite hardship on users all kindles should lite upjoyce gray,i did not realize it did not have a built 
5.0,i had to replace my old kindle love the new features on this version going to buy another for my daughter,love the new features on this version
1.0,i cannot find the text to speech feature this should have been clearly stated in the product description text to speech is on all my prior kindles people with vision problems should avoid this kindle,i cannot find the text to speech feature this 
4.0,it was confusing to order expected a paperwhite and its just the older kind of kindle as a touchscreen,it was confusing to order expected a paperwhite
5.0,my first kindle i simply love it even without a back light its completely glare free and im enjoying every page of every book i read now my daughter is wanting one and cant for christmas because this is going to be onee of her gifts,i simply love it even without a back light its completely 
5.0,connects to the internet great though you can not use it to browse the internet only amazon for books some times it skips a page when progressed so its something to watch out for it downloads books effortlessly and doesnt keep you from using the kindle as it is downloading it is very easy to read from and it really does look like paper it doesnt have all the bells and whistles of the higher models but i dont think they are necessary i almost bought the next model up but it was so much more expensive and i only wanted that one because it comes with free 3g internet and i dont have good access to internet right now all in all i think this base model is a great value and i would recommend it to anyone,connects to the internet great though you can not use it to browse the 
1.0,well this kindle was amazing for exactly a year it worked well and i used it frequently with a great battery life however as soon as the warranty expired the screen froze and the customer help guy said my only option was to buy a new one or google kindle repairs in your area,well this kindle was amazing for exactly a year
5.0,my grand daughter loves her kindle i love mine as well which is why we bought the second one from amazon who give the best products and the best prices and the best shipping this kindle meets her every need book lover that she is no longer does she have to haul around a huge book bag of books,happily reading anytime anyplace
1.0,my old kindle with the side buttons broke so i bought this one i absolutely hate it and will be sending it back maybe its just me but i dont like the touch screen i found it difficult and confusing also i had a page freeze on me unfroze an hour later i just wanted to buy a basic kindle so i can read books i guess they dont make it anymore,sending it back
5.0,this is my second purchase the screen broke on the first one after about 3 years it started as a dot and then eventually messed up 50 of the screen i took good care of it so i dont think it was anything i did eventually i love this reader so much that i decided to get another one very quickly amazon has always the best customer service in all my experience and even though they didnt do anything about the first one i am still confident in their products,simple ereader just the way it should be
4.0,a great introduction to those that are looking for a dedicated ereader and find back lit devises harsh on the eyes it is easy to setup and use a great gift for those with poor eye sight that enjoy reading if youve ever held a large print book they are huge and heavy this is so light there is no issue holding it for hoursat only 60 and free 2day shipping at this time this is a great thing to order and donate to a local charity with free wifi everywhere being able to borrow from the local library and the large list of free ebooks available at amazon this is a great present to share with those less fortunate,great introduction to ereader
5.0,first the product is greathowever amazon dropped the price by 20 one week after i bought this i feel a bit cheatedupdate amazon offered to refund me the 20i bought this after i stepped on my kindle keyboard i got in 2010 i wasnt happy with getting a new model i loved one i hadthe speed the touch screen and the bigger capacity has won me over i especially like that it integrates with goodreads,good product missed a huge savings opportunity updated
4.0,i had some problems with this kindle as described on my previous review copied bellow but the excellent amazon customer service promptly contacted me and proposed me a solution which was updating the kindle software or replacing the device as last resource i have been using this kindle for a few days after the update and now it works like a charm i am giving 4 starts to this kindle and 6 stars for the excellent customer serviceif you dont care about having an integrated service with goodreads i would still recommend the previous kindle 4th generation because is thinner lighter and aesthetically more beautiful nevertheless being able to access goodreads on your kindle is perfect and if you care about that i would definitely recommend this kindle 6 touchscreeni was reluctant to upgrade my old kindle because it worked great for me however the integration with goodreads was something that i wanted and since it is unlikely that amazon will release a firmware upgrade for old kindles i decided to give this new model a chance i have to say that i am frustrated with my decision and i still read most of my ebook on my good old kindlecons sometimes the touch screen stays active for few seconds even after kindle is put to sleep because of that my books are frequently in different pages when i turn back on and it is a pain to find back the right page when i am reading in the airplane mode to save some battery errors appears in the middle of the reading saying that it couldnt find network connection i have to turn some pages back and forth to make the message disappear and when it does sometimes it skips randomly a few pages or a whole chapter and it is again a pain to find back the right page the touch screen was not designed for left handed people the software that runs on this kindle feels like horriblepros integrated with goodreadsthe previous kindle fourth generation is simpler but very well designed this new one sounds cool in theory but they did a nice job in ruining the reading experience besides making the device thicker heavier and less attractive aesthetically speaking,problem solved thanks amazon
5.0,this is my 5th kindle device although only 4 are still working this one is a completely different type more like a tablet or ipad it is touch sensitive to turn the page you sweep your finger across it instead of pushing a bar to me that is more labor intensive but i dont think its supposed to be you tap the screen in various areas to bring up menus its harder to me to create and fill collections than on the other type but one can get used to almost everything i suppose the fact that you can load so many more books on it is a high plus in its favor im not sorry i bought this at all im still in love with the technology of ebooks,not like previous generations some better some worse
1.0,there is no information saying that it does not have a backlight so you cant read it in the darkie at bedtime,there is no information saying that it does not have 
2.0,when i orderd it i did not know you have 2 sizes disappointed that i got the 6 inch scream i am still trying it,disappointed that i got the 6 inch scream
3.0,i was disappointed that it didnt indicate that it didnt have the contacts on the back for a casewith lighting,i was disappointed that it didnt indicate that it didnt have the 
3.0,would like the screen to have some back light or something cant read unless i have a light right on the kindle,would like the screen to have some back light or something 
1.0,i cannot even use this as i have to register a credit card to use it for free to read free books really sucks,no free books on kindle
1.0,i took it back and exchanged is for one that has a light to read at night,one star
3.0,i wish it were lighted after all the bookmark drops down and covers some of the words i dont like that part,i dont like that part
3.0,i would like to be able to brighten the screen it is difficult to see the title of the books on the home page,i would like to be able to brighten the screen
1.0,i could barely read the words on the screen which was very disappointing i paid for a kindle that i cant use,blurry kindle
1.0,i am pleased with my kindle as it is no 2 for me but i lost 50 books from my archive tried to recover but to no avail in the new one i discovered i couldnt brighten the screen i have one eye that i am blind in and that feature would have been a help no auto portrait and landscape i am 86 and these features would help next time maybe,i am pleased with my kindle as it is no
5.0,i love it if i cant have a book in my hands this the next best thing my buddy has the kindle wback light and it is also great i read in in areas that are lite lamp inside or natural sun light outside i can download an ebook in less than a minute when traveling i can download several books to take with me now if i read more in darker areas or in bed i would have gotten kindle with the back light the battery last quite a bit longer on mine than my buddys with the extra usage of the lightso each to their own one last thought is that when reading from a book the print size is what it is but the kindle allows several different print sizes easy swipe of screen like a phone to next page or back you can hold your finger down on a word for a definition back to traveling the convenience of carrying several book in a small device is wonderful when reading just tap the top of screen you will be offered several options what ever page you are on you can return to home page and choose a different book without loosing page you were on from previous book or books times i read more then one book or one book is poems that i might want to go back to another good option is the ability to select chapters,i love it if i cant have a book in 
5.0,i just love my new kindle it does not strain the eye the dictionary vocabulary builders are exceptional and reading is such a delight i could not be happier with my order its such a beautiful gadget for avid readers making reading more than a pleasure,just what the universe ordered
5.0,this is noticeably cheaper feeling that the metallic kindle i had previously but it doesnt really matter the eink display is very sharp and makes reading much more of a pleasure than on a backlit display huge battery life makes this an obvious replacement for a pile of books on your next vacation,this is noticeably cheaper feeling that the metallic kindle i 
5.0,this is my new favorite thing now that i have a kindle i cant believe i waited so long to get one there are so many free books available ive been finding that its really easy to use its been easy to transfer mobi files that ive saved to my google drive from gutenbergorg using the usb cord the battery charged really fast when i first opened the box once i signed on to my wifi my other kindle books quickly became available to read im so excited to explore books,im so excited
4.0,great price for a perfectly sized reading device very lightweight so i wonder about durability given the price not a big worry i wished the screen was a brighter white i bought this as battery life is so much better than an ipad,great value
5.0,cutest ereader ive owned yet and lightest comfy to hold and slips easily into most purse sizes ive owned a sony 505 a basic nook a kindle fire neither of those readers have been this lightif you dont need to read in the dark like to carry your reader everywhere you go and dont need any extras like an mp3 player then this should do you just fine has a nice crisp screen and fast response time i have only ever charged this device once since i bought it four weeks later and it is still going i read about an hour a day for a no frills reader this is great value,comfy to hold and slips easily into most purse sizes
5.0,i resisted getting a kindle because i love reading actual books so much but now ive changed my mind and i love the kindle its so convenient to just grab a book online and started reading it looks just like a page and i still use a light in bed to read by so fun its really great also stays charge for like months at a time,i resisted getting a kindle because i love reading actual books so much
5.0,wow what a great gift for my husband he loves to read and does it quite often he takes it to work with him every day as he has to sit and wait for the patients he transports he has thanked me a million times for his glare free kindle he has always read before sleep he says that it is so much better than holding a bookhe loves the features as well thank you again amazon for a job well done great product great sevice as always i have truly never been disappointed with anything,what a great kindle
4.0,its a great way to store books not being a lit screen is more naturalonce in a while it jumps many pages when i just want to turn a pageits probably too complicated to be able to s at exactly what page youre on but it would be nice,pretty useful
5.0,so far so great i have not even had to recharge my new kindle yet and ive been reading my usual amount every night for at least 3 weeks i love that the paperwhite screen is not an lcd display so there is no lit up screen to stare at such screen exposure disrupts your internal clock and interferes with sleep i have enjoyed the virtual highlighting feature which sets the digital version apart from standard library books,still love books but the kindle is a useful ereader
1.0,no internal light so the reader can be used in daylight or room lighting rendering it less functional than required,disappointed
2.0,this product has very limited featuresthe screen truly is glare free and this is very light when holding,two stars
2.0,the lack of buttons in favor of a touchscreen system that isnt very user friendly was a big drawback for this model,not as good as the original
5.0,can i have my old kindleit was so much easier to work with itit looks i can not get any action with it please help,can i have my old kindle it was so 
2.0,actually meant to order the kindle with back lighting so returned this model very hard to read without back lighting,wrong kindle
3.0,thought this was able to get into the internet and get apps and things as well this was due to my misunderstanding,misunderstanding
3.0,i like the lighting would like the option to turn off the back light also soo much heavier than kindle 5th gen ,too heavy
1.0,need to send this back it did work from the time i took it out of the box another lauguange unable to translates m,need return sticker
4.0,it is quite accessible i do not like the fact that i paid 7900 now i see it for 5900 just a few weeks later,i do not like the fact that i paid 79
1.0,bought a paperwhite worked real good till yesterday when some sorry sob hacked into it updated it  left a bunch of new solicitations on it and other junk that i dont want or need sure as hell didnt ask for when i tried to get all that crap removed they didnt have anyone there smart enough to fix it and when i got mad and asked for a supervisor they transferred me to another country when i asked for someone in america again they hung up on me i recommend that you look elsewhere for a device like this because amazon thinks it can screw with whatever they want they dont give a damn about their customers signeddr george arnett ps dont let them screw you too,amazon sucks
4.0,this is my third and smallest tabletreaderinitially less than impressedreading was okish but less enjoyable than expecteddecided to keep it and a couple of weeks later my opinion came up slightlybut not to five starscontrast and font are adjustable size and character set andi can read this anywhere i can read a paper printed bookits an evolving product and will get betterjust wondering about the batterys life expectancyim guessing its throwaway when the battery no longer holds a good chargeanyone know,good enough for my tired eyes
5.0,i love the look the size the weight the toolbar is versatile and allows the reader to get anywhere and do practically anything instantly when i need a definition i just touch the word itself and hold until the dictionary entry appears this kindle also lets you decide how much reading assistance you get so its a great reader for children and adults the only thing that isnt perfect is the swipe pageturn its very sensitive and once in a while it skips ahead whoa other than that its great,a great deal for the price
4.0,i was a little disappointed in this kindle it is very light weight but the screen feels smaller than my old kindle and it is harder to see at night the feature i like the most is the ability to change the font size now i dont have to always wear my glasses to read the other thing that is annoying is that the touchscreen is so sensitive that if you accidentally lightly brush it you will activate a change in font or the dictionary the old kindle cover will not fit the new kindle and i wish they would make them universali also dont like the kindle store front the way the books are listed it is hard to read the titlesthey are too small once you have downloaded a book otherwise the kindle works well,i was a little disappointed in this kindle
3.0,its a fine reader bit my elderly mother could not master the options on the touch screen she has an older reader with the hard keys on the devicethe battery is tiring and i thought it would be nice to replace it with a nee one nogo for the 88 year old,need a very simple granny kindle
4.0,i bought this kindle for my wife but i soon realized that the operating protocols were different from my 4year old kindle fire since she was already familiar with the kf i decided let her have the kf and to try the kindle 6 i like it for reading books and have more or less adopted it i like the long battery life the light weight its compactness and the low price with choice of fonts format and line spacing i have it adjusted for very easy reading i plan to let my wife have the old kindle fire and do much of my reading with the kindle 6,a fine simple ebook reader
5.0,this kindle is great for binge reading because its light and can be held in one hand i like the ability to adjust the screen brightness text size and text style to make it easier to read the antiglare screen is probably its best feature i have tried it out in direct sunlight in and out doors and it truly is antiglare its easy to use and purchasing books from the store is very quick you dont have to wait more than a few seconds for them to download great for when you finish a book in a series and cant wait to get your hands on the next one for the price this is a great value,this kindle is great for binge reading
4.0,good,four stars
5.0,i have visual problems and the kindle makes reading so much easierthere is no glare and i can adjust the size of the letters the only problem i have had is not knowing how to get rid of word wise and turning too many pages at a time and not being able to go back a couple of pages without going to home go to and type in the page number i should probably read more of the user guide but to be honestit is not that helpful my kindle did not have a tutorial on it or else i did something wrong could use some help here,i have visual problems and the kindle makes reading so 
3.0,good,three stars
2.0,this is my 3rd kindle ive liked and enjoyed using my kindles from the start butim an old dog that doesnt want to learn a new trick and i hate this kindle 6 touch screen model i liked the weight the feel the side buttons the content format and numerous other features of my 1st two kindles this new model is slightly bigger slightly wider slightly thicker you name it all of the differences are so slight that you almost cant tell but when im reading i can and i dont like it im not a tech person i just want to read a book give me simple and im happy ive invested way too much money in amazon books to switch as my collection is close to 275 books amazon you need to give the people what they want,ive liked and enjoyed using my kindles from the start
3.0,okay,three stars
5.0,this is exactly what i wanted an ereader and the ability to order more books from the ereader it is easy to setup because it comes setup for you this is the basic reader there is no light or ability to listen to audiobooks it is very lightweight you can hold it in one hand while you are reading the battery lasts a long time i had it a week before i charged the battery and i read every day,it is easy to setup because it comes setup for you
5.0,good,five stars
5.0,first kindle ive owned it was given to me as a gift nice i knew nothing about these other than people talked about the kindle and how they like them for reading one thing i would have liked with it was a backlight didnt take any stars off because it was a gift and i guess i could have somehow returned it and got one with a backlight only other thing is it seems slow to boot up but it doesnt matter after all if you are into speed you probably arent reading just an observation good basic ereader,good basic ereader
5.0,good,five stars
5.0,good,five stars
1.0,it is very difficult to highlight return to the page in a book where you left off its too easy to accidentally turn a page or go somewhere else by mistake and generally use the device the old side buttons were much better i and my wife will not be using these new kindles nearly as much as we did the old ones now inoperable,not user friendly
5.0,i am really enjoying my kindle although i think all the novels and books are short stories they are still good to read,they are still good to read
3.0,to amazon the kindle dosent have it on light in other words iam not happy with cover or the kindlefommanny,not hasppy
1.0,i bought one it does not have a backlight so the only place it really helps is out side full daylight only good because i use it in conjunction with my samsung smart phone which is much better than the kindle my reco is upgrade to a better model do yourself a favor save your money this model is a waste,only good because i use it in conjunction with my samsung 
4.0,coming from a 2nd generation kindle this is pretty great so light and airy the touch screen is fun options are great my biggest complaint is how sensitive the touch screen isif it touches anything it changes the page sometimes several on me andor the font i come from using an iphone which has amazing technology that know when skin touches it doesnt type etc if my shirt or a cup bump into it its quite an adjustment from the buttons turning the page but ill adjust its still pretty amazing,this is pretty great so light and airy
5.0,it may not show as verified purchase because my husband bought this for me on his amazon account for christmas this year and i love it no hard glare because it doesnt have the lit up screen but it is great in sunlight battery lasts longer then my other e reader holds thousands of books and has never froze on me like other ereaders have great buy for the price if you want all the apps chose the kindle fire if you want a kindle for only reading this one is perfecti like using the goodreads connection available with this kindle also,longer lasting battery
4.0,i would really like to say that i love it but cant because im spoiled and wanted the one with text to speech i wasnt aware that all kindles didnt come with it at first the touch screen display is a bit choosy and can be a bit of a pain after a full days use i found it wonderful i would still love the text to speech feature but i am happy with what it does come withreading is a breeze no glare no issues beyond the listedwonderful product and would recommend it to others,i like it
2.0,i keep losing the book i am reading and cant retrieve it written instructions should be sent rather than put on the screen,i keep losing the book i am reading and cant 
4.0,i like my new kindle i exchanged it for the older model that did not yet have a touch screen my old kindle started loosing its screen after 3 years it seems a common issue i was very impressed with the ease that amazon sent me a new one at a really good price i really like the grey background it is comfortable to read for my eyes this kindle is a little thicker than the old model and the screen seems smaller even though it is not the frame just makes it seem like that i liked the sizing better on my older kindle but i guess there is more technology in this one and that might take extra space there is a lot of free dictionaries available and you can organize your books into categories which is great when you have a lot of them altogether a great thing for people who travel a lot and like to have their books with them without the weight,great screen happy customer
5.0,good,five stars
5.0,i got this kindle as a gift from a book event i went to and i love it its very light and small so it fits in my purse perfectly i havent charged it in a month and i use it on and off so for me the battery is great i highly recommend this kindle,light weight
4.0,nice,four stars
4.0,great product for the price it does not have a light but i knew this when i bought it probably comparing the price to paperwhite it would be the better deal if you definitely dont need a light i bought it for use outdoors during day becausei cannot see on my kindle hdx at all outdoors during daylight,great product for the price
5.0,nice,five stars
5.0,this was gifted to me i am very happy with it so far i have not had any problems using overdrive to download books directly to my kindle from my local library i like that the text font size is adjustable that there is a dictionary available i immediately purchased a screen protector and a hard shell cover for it without the cover the kindle felt slick and fragile and i was afraid that i would damage it in no time,adjustable font sizes are nice
4.0,good,good
5.0,i was worried about these being refurbished but they look and work perfect no need to fear the word this is a great transition from paper to electric easy on the eyes for those who have issues with back lit readers faster reading i suggest that if youre thinking about christmas presents get it and a gift card for kindle books,pleasently suprised
4.0,cool,four stars
5.0,i bought this for my father who is in the hospital after a serious issue he was in there without his glasses and could not read anything in normal print when this arrived i put some louis lamour books on it for him and took down to him he was able to read the screen without glasses and without having to blow the font all the way up this came through exactly like i needed it to thank you amazon,let me give books back to my father
5.0,love,five stars
5.0,this is a great value at 50 for a reader my 1st generation kindle bit the dust and it cost about 350 way back then i love the touch screen for all function except on and off the only thing i can see that would be nice is to have the ability to zoomin on graphs and diagrams this kindle like my 1st generation device leave those images very hard to read if not impossible i read mostly technical books and have thought about the larger kindle offerings but havent been willing to put out the cash for books where i need to really see the graphics i by paper books but other than that this is a great reader,this is a great value at 50 for a reader
5.0,good,five stars
5.0,cool,five stars
5.0,good,five stars
4.0,smaller than earlier onesstill easy to read on bright enough and clear very portable and light but big enough to read i bought a protective case separately and it makes it more substantial since my last one only lasted a year thats important these are fragile portable love the touch screen i do wish it had audible but its not a deal breaker i dont mind the ads they only show up when you turn it on the older versions just had kindle ads these are kindle plus other companies or products if they dont interest one swipe and they are gone,worth getting especially on sale
4.0,good kindle and knew what i was buying but still find the lack of backlight more irritating than i thought i would i have a kindle paperwhite and my husband snagged this one to replace his recently broken kindle touch we bought a case with a light but there just arent enough products with a durable enough light to make this a worthwhile purchase anymore glad we snagged this on sale,pretty good kindle just hate that there is no backlight
5.0,i have a kindle 2 and only replaced it because the screen cracked and it was slowing way down but i can tell ill love this as much as soon as i get used to the difference in touch and buttons im still learning how it works so im slower finding things on this one,think im gonna love it
5.0,high quality and durable feeling easy to use though every now and again i do activate the wrong action when touching the screen it is tons easier to use then the old model i used a little the old one used button controls that were tough and confusing to navigate this model generation 7 the controls are really easy to learn and understand,well made little device
4.0,this item definitely does what it says it allows you to read books without carrying books with you it isnt built to do anything else but it does that one thing really wellthis version is the lowest tier of kindle available it has none of the bells and whistles like 3g access to the internet or a backlight or a high definition screen however if you load on a bunch of books and it will hold lots and lots of books you dont need the 3g even when you cant find a wifi signal it has its own dictionary so you can still look up words even without wireless signal it is light and easy to hold and the user interface feels very intuitive to me without a backlit screen you do need a decent light source to read but then so do books the screen is clear and readable and i appreciate being able to make the text different sizesyes the screen savers on this device are advertisements there are no ads while you are actually reading and hey you might find a new book or two that you would love that you wouldnt have heard of otherwise so far the ads seem pretty unobtrusive to me but if you dont like them you can pay a fee and amazon will turn them off for you which seems reasonable especially as its only a one time fee not an ongoing charge my old 3rd gen kindle has a finite number of screen savers and you cant change them so this is at least differentoverall for the price i paid given that i cant afford the paperwhite or the voyager this is a good reading device with a good screen that is easy to use but isnt full of the fun bells and whistles that come if you can invest more money into your electronics,like 3g access to the internet or a backlight or 
5.0,i bought 2 of these for my grandkids for christmas they are exactly as described the glare free screen makes it easy on their eyes and they can read in different lighting conditions which makes it great for reading in the car or in bed at night the size is great too,grandkids loved them
1.0,compared to my old kindle which i lost this one stinks cant adjust brightness not user friendly if i could return it i would,compared to my old kindle which i lost this 
5.0,the kindle continues to improve this is the third incarnation of the kindle ive had this one is wifi only but picks up the local signals with ease i got the cover designed to go with this kindle which automatically puts it to sleep when you close it its much easier to use than my last kindle this one has thumbnails of the covers of the books so i can browse my library more easily and an option to read them off the cloud or download them to my device all in all kindle technology is advancing and making me happy,best reading experience ever
3.0,could not even read it was so dark i didnt know it was dark and did not want to use a light completely useless for my needs,not for me
5.0,before this kindle i hated reading the page feeling of a book makes me cringe and the glare from light is awful on a regular book this kindle allows me to personalize my reading experience for myself it makes it so i can space the text how i want make it bolder change margins and tracks the percent and location im at in the book making it more fun because i see my progress its awesome and has driven me to start reading tons now best gift ever,amazing device i actually enjoy reading for the first time in my life
2.0,not the best kindle option on the market i guess it is a good option if you dont want any think other than reading capabilities,nah not for me
3.0,cons i had a kindle keyboard for years but someone stepped on it and the screen cracked it like it was time to upgrade to the new version to me my old one seemed like the perfect sizeshape for an ereader i used it all the time and it was comfortable to hold and read on this one is smaller and the housing feels cheaper i know i just bought the glare free version not the version that has a reading light but my last one you could at least adjust the contrast of the screen the text cannot be adjusted to be darker on this onepros it functions well looks clean is fast and holds a lot of books the battery life is truly impressive the ability to sync directly to goodreads is fantasticoverall im just not as excited about picking this up to read on as i was about my last kindle simply for the way it feels in my hands that and because i absolutely have to use it in a very well lit room or outside but it functions exactly as you would expect from a kindle and i do not regret the purchase whatsoever,i only have an issue with the style
4.0,was very unhappy to see that its completely useless for reading in the dark at night one of the main reasons i got it,was very unhappy to see that its completely useless for reading in the dark at night
4.0,i bought the kindle touch because my kindle keyboard screen no longer worked i havent had the touch long but so far i like it i do miss the buttons that the other model had i didnt want a touchscreen and find that the touch is sensitive and turns more than one page at a time as far as the other options on this reader go i probably wont use them,i havent had the touch long but so far i like it i do miss the buttons that the 
1.0,while it is lighter than the original having a light in the cover is missed the most a clipon light is what i was avoiding when i bought the first one this is a replacement but after using it for awhile it is a poor replacement less settings available for operating the kindle turning on and off the wifi is a pain since that button is no longer on the menu,it is a poor replacement less settings available for operating the kindle
1.0,received one as a gift for my birthday from my kids quit working 18 days after warranty ended very expensive brick do not buy,received one as a gift for my birthday from my 
3.0,i like it but i never got the cover i order for it could u check in to that it on my card so i would like to have it soon please,i like it but i never got the cover i order

1.0,i dont like it dont wo property the settings dont work i cant buy any books i cant connect to a wifi im very disappointed,i dont like it dont wo property the settings dont work i 
2.0,hi i just bought it and i really dont like the product when i touch the screen to see next page the screen get fluctuates,and i really dont like the product
4.0,although i just used this kindle once i really like it for the fact it is so easy on the eyes if you read a lot like i do reading a book on a tablet is not an option because of the glare and that is the reason why i didnt buy a kindle with back lighting my only complains are it doesnt come with any paperwork explaining how to use the software so you have to play with it and use it hit or misssome of the pages came with highlights i didnt know how to delete and you can only download kindle books unlike other tablets,easy on the eyes
5.0,i finally relented and purchases a kindle i have always loved the feel of a good book in my hands flipping the paper pages seeing the progress as your bookmark moves through the book the basic kindle had the easiest to read screen in terms of strain on your eyes i also loved some of the features like the time left in the chapter and the total progress ,for all you holdouts get this kindle you wont regret it
4.0,ill admit im one of those who didnt clearly understand that amazon was still producing paperwhites and regular kindles i thought kindles had evolved to the point where they were all using paperwhite technology and that only the older models werent paperwhites i already owned a paperwhite that i bought last year but recently gave it to my wife so i was looking for a second one when i saw that this was latest generation i assumed that it had all the latest features including the backlight and chalked the lower price up to the fact that it was refurbished im not sure the lack of a backlight option would have been a dealbreaker but i wish i had known at the time anyway no fault of the device just wish amazon were clearer in their marketing of paperwhite technology,not a paperwhite no backlight
4.0,i purchase this after my kindle fire developed some recharge issues i like the kindle 6 better i read outside a lot and find this one easier to see and hold the easily adjustable font is very easy to convert with each book i also like the fact that it is lightweight and easily fits in my purse im still figuring out how to catagorize my books so that i know what ive read but ill eventually figure it out,light weight
5.0,its great but i wish i didnt need wifi  i find it a pain why cant i order from my kindle and be done with itmarilyn,its great but i wish i didnt need wifi
5.0,love my new kindle this is my 3rd kindle and im just as happy with it as i was my other 2 i first got the kindle keyboard that still works i got the kindle fire when it first came out but just after that it became a kindle hd for the same price as i paid for a nonhd model was a bit bothered by that but not a biggie now i got my new 6 kindle got the lowestpriced one and am very happy with it i dont need all the extra bells whistles so this will do me just fine,still love kindle
1.0,nice bait and switch amazon you have to join prime to get sale price join prime and you now need to be put on a waitlist only to find waitlist full horrible business practice,amazon bait and switch
5.0,i specifically purchased this bottom model in order to not have any background lighting and avoid the blue screen issues associated with sleep interference and i thought that something that did not have the distractions of facebook and candy crush would be more productive ended up being pleased for so many more reasons lightweight compact super easy to read and turn pages along with an amazing battery life,no blue screen
3.0,i must be a dumb senior citizen to purchase this without any instructions in the box it keeps turning off on me though it is charged,i must be a dumb senior citizen to purchase this without any instructions in 
5.0,very nice i have already downloaded 2 books from the owner library and the public library very easy and so nice to be able to hold a library book without worrying about all the other people who have also held it a little germophobic,great item
2.0,had a paper white lost it bought this as a replacement is not backlit spend the extra money paper white much much much better device,is not backlit spend the extra money paper white much much much better device
5.0,bought for my 9 year old to encourage him to read its working according to him reading kindle books on ipad mini it was too tempting to play a game or get distracted now with kindle its books and only books hes read 3 or 4 so far and can choose his own with my approval only thing i dont like is that really inappropriate books are advertised on the off screen not happy about words like murder appearing every time he picks the thing up other than that its great illustrations still show up as on ipad just in black and white which is fine,great for kids less the ads
1.0,guess i didnt realize it doesnt have a light like my old one did now have to hold up phone with flashlight to read quite annoying,no light
4.0,snagged this during the black friday sale for 49 i have the other devices to read my kindle books on but having one that will help with distractions email facebook notifications candy crush etc has helped get me reading more after searching several stores for cases with no luck i found the amazon case for 25 at best buy and it fits perfectly as its specific for this device i wish the cover would unlock the device when opened but its just a quick swipe i can tell from other reviews that they havent read the description of what this does and the same goes with cases though trying to figure out which one to order was tricky so i am glad i found the correct case at a store for cheaper than on the amazon site plus i dont have prime so the 35 free shipping limit wouldnt have helped much overall i am pleasedsimple inexpensive and gets me reading,does what it says it does
5.0,i like my kindle i showed it to a friend and she asked me to order a kindle for her i ordered it and she is waiting to receive it,i like my kindle
5.0,its a kindle it displays books just like it is supposed to readable no light as expected my cell phone charger plug works for it just fine so no need to buy another i bought this on the march 15 special for 59 i have an older kindle fire as well but this is better for books im not distracted by apps the battery life is way longer and it is much lighter the adverts are not too annoying mostly books and only show on the first screen before you swipe it to turn it on of course their proposed advert books are way off from my interest but hey thats amazon theyll figure it out one of these days i bought a black leatherlike cover elsse for kindle 7th gen for about 9 and i dont like screen protectors so the whole kit was only 68 satisfied customer,just like it is supposed to
3.0,i expected it to be lighter and i didnt expect it to be as dark as it was im not saying its bad just not for me i returned it,had to return not what i expected
1.0,it can do smarter things with pdf zooming and scroll features work great but given the latent refresh the reader easily loses focus,it can do smarter things with pdf

1.0,really amazon you took away the battery connection really id really like to smack someone upside the head with this thing my kindle keyboard 3g just kicked up its tiny heels and died so i ordered the new touch the only not backlit one of the new batch and a lighted case except the lighted case is for the old kindle touch and not the new kindle touch because some genius decided to not include the connection pads on the new one i dont like reading on a backlit screen especially at night it strains my eyes im pretty sure there are eleventy billion other people who feel the same way im sure at some point a thirdparty manufacturer will come up with a working lighted case with its own power source im pissed that its completely unnecessary and kind of a jerk move youre getting too big for your britches amazon maybe you should reconsider putting the screws to your customers before they all jump ship for bn,no connection pads for a lighted case

5.0,so i had an earlier version and love kindles this one doesnt have buttons which i kinda miss but the touch screen works pretty well i like that they changed the way its made the screen is the same size but its a little thicker and a lot more compact so it fits in small bags and large pockets better havent figured out how to make collections on this one yet but i havent spent a lot of time trying so there is probably a way,so i had an earlier version and love kindles this one doesnt have buttons which i 
3.0,i loved my old kindle this one is thick and heavy in comparison the touch screen is too sensitive it gets to busy doing things that i dont like to have happening eg it keeps changing fonts or opens a dictionary when i accidentally touch the screen i miss the page turning buttons on the side with this one you have to move your hand from where you are holding the kindle in order to swipe the screen,i loved my old kindle
5.0,i know that this might sound weird for some people but kindle glare free works better for me than paperwhite i was recently gifted with this kindle and i love it more than my old paperwhite mainly because of the light gray pages and the absence of the screen light which tired my eyes after long hours of reading,love it so much
5.0,we recently had to order a new kindle as our last kindle developed a screen problem after several years we replaced one of the first kindles and i have to say the new one is a marked improvement at an excellent price my son loves the white screen and the touchscreen aspect compared to the scrolling and typing his last one had its beautiful easy to use and vibrant hoping lots of reading gets accomplished with it nice and light for carrying to school too,great price great improvement
5.0,i loved to read on my kindle fire we are talking 100 books a year and that is not good for my eyes also not very useful in bright places got this on sale and i absolutely love it this was used to upgrade my original kindle the my husband was using for his textbooks super easy setup i was reading within a few mins of opening only thing i dont like is that it does not come with a wall charger,reading within mins
5.0,the kindle touch 7th gen2014 is my first ereader ever ive been thinking of getting one for a while since reading off a tablet or even a lcd screen anything backlit is very fatiguing on the eyes my eyes feel extremely tired and dry after any such reading session another big reason for my purchase is two books that i wanted to buy were about 25 each while the kindle versions were 10 a great incentive to finally take the plunge right there was a savings of 30 its the same for other books with varying degrees of costsavingon to this one i considered either this or the paperwhite and eventually went with the touch to save the 40 upon opening the box and slipping the kindle out of its plastic case i wanted to remove the sticker stuck across the screen but lo and behold it was the actual screen amazing the text on this reader looks exactly like a printed page actually better specifications say that the paperwhite is a higher resolution but let me tell you i cannot imagine text being any more crisp than this at least i doubt that the human eye can really differentiate itits a real plus to be able to set the text size to what you desire i imagine this is a big plus to older people who are getting in the reading glasses zone the only thing i would say is that the software could be a bit better in this regard the text size selection should stay with the book rather than be a system wide selection right now if i change the font size it does it for all books and for some reason different books have different default sizes in general the operating system is good but i imagine it can get a lot better one thing that is good is the ability to set up the kindle for other users ie freetime you can set up a freetime account another user on your kindle and only add selected books to their library that way you an keep more adult oriented books away from kids for instancethis kindle requires light to read but thats not an issue for me its just like a book you need a light to read so im either in a lit room or use my bedside lampive had mine for about 10 days now and the battery is still at least 30 charged in these 10 days i have discovered a ton of free kindle books from racy novels to biographies to classics to a magic book its really drawing me back in to reading its amazing to be able to have hundreds of books right in your hands theres no doubt that printing of books will be gone within the next generation and with this wonderful device screen technology i wont miss themin summary i would say that if the extra 40 is no problem spring for the paperwhite as having the lit screen different from backlit screens could be useful when reading in bed with someone else allinall i have to say that this is easier on my eyes than any screen or even a regular book and it is getting me back to the joys of reading its been a great purchase for me,my first ereader and it is awesome
1.0,i bought this the package arrived timely and in good condition this review does not reflect negatively on midcontinent whom i have bought from before and look forward to purchasing through again this review is about the productkindle ereader when the kindle arrived i discovered the usb cable was insufficient to properly charge the kindle per information supplied by kindle  so i purchased ac adapter for additional 2000 then discovered after charging the kindle battery and reviewing the eoperators manual i had to have wifi to link to computer i dont have wifi so i purchased a netgear 23 usb wifi usb adapter for 3000 to create linkage between my computer and the kindle supposedly cannot use the cable supplied with kindle to download then spent 3 hours on amazon tech support and 65 hours trying to register kindle that according to amazon was already registered because i am a customer but the kindle doesnt know that the wifi netgear23 connection is listed on the wifi networks the kindle can identify but will not recognize any passwords to allow me to complete the registration process and enable use of the kindle there is a workaround i can use the enclosed cable and the cloud which i have never used and if i download one book the cost to use the cloud is 500 thats the monthly minimum chargesupposedly the more i use the cloud the less the pro rata charge up to a volume level of data whereat the charges increase for my nook there is no cost no cloud involved getting a kindle up and running should not be this hard or costly to do the additional costs are not transparent to the purchaser the kindle does not appear to have a way to back out of the registration process once one is into it to change passwords user ids nor confirm same yesterday the amazon tech spent 3 hours and we couldnt solve the problem today i called back and the amazon tech was in a noisy boiler room and could not hear me could not make her computer work and being located oconus was having as many problems understanding my english as i was having understanding hers she seemed like a nice person but we didnt talk long i have a nook i have used it for years i wanted the kindle to download ebooks that are not otherwise available i am frustrated unhappy and not a happy camperbut the world as i know it will go on no i cannot get through or out of the registration loop on the kindle i cannot download the kindle ebooks but at this point that is infinitely more easy to live with than fruitlessly trying to make the kindle i bought operational,there are hidden costs and no guarantee of successful useage
3.0,everything workswell with this kindle but i wish i had my last one with backlight i dont like having to read it only when the room lighting allows,good kindle but i miss having backlight
3.0,i should have looked a little more its a good size but i dont like that there isnt a light so i can read at night or maybe a bright to dim switch,its a good size but i dont like that there isnt 
5.0,my grandson austin loves it the picture quality is amazing he uses it for gaming and videos in addition to reading and i would highly recommend it,the picture quality is amazing he uses it for gaming and videos in 
3.0,did not like it to where i could not adjust lightwanted to read it in bed and it is difficult without great overhead lighting but otherwise love it,too low a light
1.0,i didnt like the graphics and i think its more for a child but it being black and white i wouldnt want it for my kids because its confusing to work,kindle
1.0,this is my third kindle and i was so excited to get it because the other one had died and i was forced to read on my ipad mini which i really dont like i got the new kindle today opened it and was really upset to find that the new version incorporates all the really irritating things i really hate about my ipad plus its a weird size thats hard to hold onto and the menu takes up almost half the screen im really considering sending it back if its going to work just like my irritating ipad then theres no reason to have it,such a disappointment
2.0,it doesnt do much i was surprised it had no other downloads but books also the cover didnt fit i returned it really not happy about it at all,not happy
4.0,this is great for novels but i read a lot of nonfiction with pictures maps and diagrams which are difficult to visualize the details i would recommend this for any book that does not contain visual aids because they dont in this format i still havent worked out all the manipulations of the device yet which can be sometimes frustrating when one finds oneself going in circles but given time i expect to figure it all out again great for fiction not so good for maps and diagrams and it saves space not needed for a collection of many huge bookcases ,recommended for novels
1.0,can not download books directly to device from the library must go through computer this is crazy i want library use to be easy not complicated,i want library use to be easy not complicated
5.0,this was surprisingly easy to navigate and as one review pointed out the touchscreen is highly responsive setting up collections was a bit tricky so you may want to create those first if you dont have them already before downloading your archived items on your device i wasnt too thrilled with the experimental web browser at first but it too is fairly easy to managenavigate once you get used to it i love it,my new favorite tech toy
1.0,tvery disappointed the page is not bright enough to read at night without buying a light to show honor which of course is separate it doesnt come with the cover i bought im just disappointed in the whole thing,tvery disappointed the page is not bright enough to read at 
1.0,hate it almost everything about itdont want to swipe want to passively click and not be forced to perform a twohanded maneuverdont want the font changing or big popup screens taking over every time i touch the bloody thing hate that im restricted to keeping my fingers cramped along edges in constant fear of having my reading interrupted by screen tricksreally really really hate that the books dont disappear into collections once categorized how am i supposed to know which ive read and which i havent yes you are going to tell me that the line of dots under listing indicates where in book i left off except it doesnt for books imported from other devices like my last kindle in other words all my booksam now going on ebay to find old version,failing to detect the so called improvements
2.0,i wish i ordered add free version at first i did not understand it and for the price i ordered now it is getting very annoying with amazon adds,add free version is better
5.0,i like to read the classics some of the authors are no longer in print and buying them used is quite expensiveit was a no brainier to buy this kindle since most of the books i read are free from amazoni would highly recommend this kindle it is easy to use holds a charge for a long time and its a breeze to buy more books for it on amazon since the devise is linked through your wifi,love it
5.0,i had to adjust from my old kindle keyboard model but im finding the page turning etc although an adjustment is comfortable after a book or two it loads quickly i liked my old home screen better but this is a good reader,is comfortable after a book or two
5.0,i bought this because it was a kindle for 59 at first i thought maybe ill give it as a gift but it is so light and little and the characters are so dark and crisp and it still looks like my preferred screen on the kindle keyboard so i am keeping it for now i really like this one,its so little and cute
5.0,this is a way to read books on the goit fits in my pocket of my coatjust the right sizelightand easy to usei am a little older personwho reads a lot of booksas you get older you need more light and bigger printwhat i like best about my kindle is i can read out sideinstead of staying in house on a beautiful dayand i can adjust the print sizei can carry all my books on amazon cloud where ever i go really neatthe price is rightstart enjoy reading againi don t need a bright light to read bythat is cool,kindle 6 a handy device
5.0,bought to use for just ebook reading mainly kindle books was using hdx 7 because of battery usage of hdx i had to charge a lot i will mainly use for reading in restaurants doctors while waiting for planes i mainly keep in my car when traveling in a amazon basics zip pouch battery will last weeks i purchased at very low price 50 or would have gotten paperwhite if bought direct touch works fine found a cheap portrait case for it because screen doesnt rotate strictly vertical portrait,good basic kindle ereader no backlight portrait only
4.0,i ordered this for my grandmother its a wonderful device my only problem is it does not come with written instructions i understand it has instructions loaded on it however for older generation that are not tech savvy it would be helpful to have a print manual once she gets the hang of it im sure she will love it,great device
5.0,amazing with a bright background and overall very easy to use only thing it lacks on this model is a background ight but i use my small reading clip on light if needed at night and it works just perfectly i also thought i would end up hating and removing the special offers ads but they surprisingly dont bother like i thought they would plus i saved some money the special offers in my opinion dont distract me from reading as they dont show up when reading so i dont find them to be annoying but that is a personal choice of course the only thing i was a little disappointed about is that im a prime member and most of the books that i was looking to borrow from the lending library for prime members were not available as lenders but only as purchases hopefully the lending library keeps growing as that was one of the primary reasons why i bought a kindle overall i am very pleased with my kindle,finally got my kindle

4.0,i returned it for the white background one for my wife who sight problemshe is delighted with it she is able see the larger print with little room lite,she is delighted with it
1.0,worst product i have ever dealt with by far beware originally wifi worked fine and had no issue getting booksthan after a month or so could not connect to any of the 15 wifi configurations i had tried along with hours of troubleshooting still simply said it could not connect ended up smashing it off the balcony it seems as if they wifi adapter just fried or something please do not buy this trash,do not buy
3.0,this kinkle is okay i have the old hd fire so i wanted a kindle mainly for reading something that was lighter and this fit the bill it is definately lighter i was disappointed it didnt have the light but i knew that when i bought it the touch screen doesnt bother me too much except when the fonts change on its own the only thing i dont like about this kindle is that it freezes frequently i have to reboot multiple times luckily ive only had to reboot when i was at home but i would be very disappointed if i had set aside some reading time at a park or the beach only to no have it work not sure how thats gonna get fixed,freezes frequently
5.0,ive been traveling with this for over a week now and really it its light weight and a good size to travel with im giving it five stars because it been fun to read with and i really like being able to see the scree in the sunlight figuring out the configuration is not as intuitive as id like it to be so i suggest reading the manual for all you guys out there unlike tablets youd dont have a lot of light coming off the screen so you need to be reading in a well light environment to see the screen allinall im very happy,its light weight and a good size to travel with
4.0,i thought this would be a nice change nothing but books and nothing else i have another kindle bigger and full of stuff besides books and i get caught up in redditch and fb well this little guy fits the bill i wasnt use to the lack of colour but im only reading its a responsive little guy and the screen size doesnt hurt my feelings its just right,a fun little thing
5.0,am so happy with my kindle i have the hd fire but i cannot read it outside so i got this on the july black friday for a great price am so glad i only wish that it had the capability to read to me as does the hd fire for those times i want to do something else while readingvery happy with it and how it syncs across all my devices,am so happy with my kindle
5.0,i got this on a black friday sale it is a up grade to the old kindle i got two years ago it took some getting use to like all new technology today i can adjust the font to suit my reading speed but i like the larger print as i move faster thru the book it is all touch screen now no more buttons hey get use to it youll like it after you have read a few books and see how fast everything coordinates when you are familiarized with the kindle ereaderthis new kindle is the greatest thing to come down the pike since sliced bread hey,technology at your finger tips with gradification for your brain go for it dude
5.0,after having the first generation what a difference in the visual quality it is clear and easy to read in all lighting andmakes reading much easier when you are not squinting all the time a great value and perfect for the avid reader,wow what a great product
5.0,i dont know why i waited so long to get one reading on a tablet sucks compared to this especially in bright light the optional browser function s and is a nice add on it is slow but one can use it to look something up or use the mobile site to check email,what one expects in a good way
3.0,this not my first kindle it is comfortable for reading and light weight compared to my first kindle i have two issues the main problem is the dark graphics which make it impossible to read the book titles it would have been nice if there was a way to adjust the display second is the annoying fact that it changes text size on its own and i have to change to me preferred setting often for those reasons i would not recommend this kindle pay more and get the paper white my daughter has that and it is good,disappointing
4.0,i really like this reader my wife got it for me for what was a decent price and i dont have to keep stealing hers the only issue i have with it is that apparently you cannot use any active content on it like her old one so all those word games that i love to play on hers are not available on mine i wish i had known that because i may have opted for a different model i guess its better that way now im forced to read instead of playing gamesas far as function works great i read on it every night the wifi works fine even from across the house in airplane mode the battery has a nice long life i recommend it,great reader but cant play games like on my wifes old touch 
4.0,love the new kindle it is light weight and stays charged a long time i would have given it 5 stars if i could have listened to my audio books on it also now i have to download them to another device to listen to otherwise it is a wonderful device very easy to use,love the new kindle
1.0,i can not like it have not been able to connect it to my wireless working on it for a few weeks now cant tell if it is a kindle problem or a computer problem,i can not like it have not been able to connect it 
2.0,no sound making the great deal with audiobooks useless discontinue my subscription to whichever scheme you decided to charge me 10 bucks per month to not use,waste of tech
4.0,if i buy this kindle with special offer from us market and then take it back to china what will happen do the special offers show correctly can i download books can i read chinese books,what about buying a kindle in us but use in china
1.0,print was very light and difficult to read no way to make it darker per amazon who suggested i upgrade to a more expensive kindle kindle returned for credit,print was very light and difficult to read no

5.0,i recently purchased this kindle with the intention of testing it out and returning it if it didnt meet my expectations after using it for over a month however its definitely become a keeperone of the first things i noticed was how much faster it was compared to my previously owned kindle keyboard im talking about both the speediness of the device itself and overall usability typing text and selecting things both feel faster on the touchscreen interface than using the kindle keyboards physical keys in addition because everything is done through the screen i can usually touch the spot where i want to move the cursor instead of having to scroll to the location the pages turn noticeably more quickly on this model than the kindle keyboard i had another thing i like is the feel of the device this kindle is a little thicker than its keyboard predecessor but its also shorter meaning holding it is even more similar to holding a small paperback book this combined with the nicely sized touchscreen and some of the touch gestures makes onehanded navigation even easier my only criticism is that the screen sometimes seems a little more sensitive than expected causing unintentional page turns this doesnt occur very frequently however and may be more due to me still getting used to the change in interacting with the device regardless this can be alleviated by using a stylus and the screen overall is well calibrated in my experienceas for the new features like vocabulary builder and integration with goodreads i dont currently use those much however i can see how theyd be useful especially in the case of studying and trying to get through difficult material or if you had kids and wanted to encourage them to read more without having to buy a separate device and if you never end up needing them it isnt ridiculously hard to either ignore them or turn them off in the system settingsoverall this was a very good purchase compared to the kindle keyboard this model is faster and more comfortable to use the extra features dont weigh it down and the new design makes the reader less aware of the hardware and more aware of whats being read,another thing i like is the feel of the device
5.0,great productive never really been a big reader and when this was on sale i decided to buy it thinking it would encourage me to read more oftenas soon as i got it i was able to get a kindle first book the einstein prophecyive been reading for about 56 hours a week since buying the kindlei like how you can read it outside without much glare at all compared to a cellphone or ipad i love that it has a really long battery life and that it saves where you left off readingi really like to use the feature where if u hold down on a word it looks up the word and gives you a definition very helpful,motivated me to read
5.0,love this kindle it does everything it is supposed to which for me means being able to read my ebook in the sun having it sync with my kindle fire means i can read the same book at night with no lights on which is good when my husband wants to sleep as you can tell i read a lot and this little reader has been awesome at the pool and the beach go for it you wont be sorry,very happy with this purchase
5.0,i got this as an anniversary gift and i love it i have loads of books on it and it is super easy to use i also love how portable it isi can slip this into my purse for silent reading time at work i work in a school and have all my books right there i definitely will be using this for some summer reading,i got this as an anniversary gift and i love it i have loads of books on it 
4.0,i purchased this kindle as a gift for my husband he is not an electronic user but prefers the old fashion pen and paper ways he is an avid reader but was having trouble seeing the print in so many of the books i showed him how he could enlarge the print and downloaded three books he is enjoying the kindle and has thanked me for it i am glad i purchased this for him,perfect gift

5.0,i am quite happy with the kindle a bit to my surprise being of an age when large print is preferred the kindle is a treasure it is easy to adjust the print size and spacing to a comfortable level and ordering new books is quite quick and simple i got it mainly because some favorite authors have some short novels that are only available as ebooks but i am acquiring quite a few interesting books to read it is easy to carry so i always have reading material handy whenever there is a little time to kill it is easier to hold while reading in bed and it turns itself off when i fall asleep,happy happy happy
3.0,i would love it if it had a backlight when i bought it i was unaware there was no backlight otherwise i may have bought another product it is easy to use and compact,i would love it if it had a backlight
5.0,wow this is just what i needed in order to read large books without having to carry them around since i read most everything in spanish i was able to configure my kindle to be a spanish version other languages are also available now if i am unsure of a word i can call it up on a spanishspanish dictionary words that i call up automatically go into a list i click on the word and it will show the definition and the sentence in which i found it this list can be viewed in a flashcard format,i turned my kindle into a spanish edition and love it
1.0,unfortunately when i decided to return i was already too late do yourself the favor and just buy up to the one with the light built in i did not realize it didnt have a light built in because come on this is 2015 just got back from traveling with it and there were times on the plane or tent that lighting was not adequate so i couldnt use the kindle yes you can attach a piece to it but personally for that i would rather read a paper book this is my first ereader outside of using my phone or ipad and i would not recommend,this is my first ereader outside of using my phone or ipad and i would not recommend

5.0,first kindle device had a minor glitch registering my new kindle touch but amazon help pleasantly and competently guided me through a reset and subsequent setup was surprised how tethered to amazoncom the device is configured requiring amazon involvement even in acquisition of library loaned literature love the contrast of the text on the screen and how it improves my experience reading on an electronic display once i figured out where to tap on the screen to maneuver through books and menu selections i liked it looking forward to expanding literary horizons now that i have so many options at my fingertips with my new kindle,pleased with new kindle touch
1.0,1 my order specified delivering it not to my residence address but to my vacation rental in montecito ca the order went to my residence address in chicago i had our condo fedex it to the address i designated to you for delivery2 i could not complete the download because the kindle did not recognize my password i changed the password and received assistance from your 800 line but the person assisting me who was quite helpful and i concluded that the new kindle was not responding or not displaying correctly certain information you have sent me the mailer to return it in the meantime i will continue to use my existing kindle my 3rd kindle which is currently operating well,1 my order specified delivering it not to 
5.0,i have the basic model and discovered this is all i need non glare optional font sizes and a nice dictornary amazon makes it a little too convenient to set up and purchase books one sign in and i was all linked up pretty impressed first kindle and on my original charge from a week plus ago nice in that regard and its very light,optional font sizes and a nice dictornary amazon makes it a little too convenient 
2.0,this product is all but useless to me without a lighted cover every other kindle either has a lighted cover available or comes with its own light why isnt amazon making a lighted cover available thats powered off the internal battery,suspicious lack of lighted covers
2.0,i play scrabble with my kindle along with a lot of reading my old kindle failed so i replaced it with this updated touch screen unit it is not compatible with scrabble and wont even download it from online big disappointment and unless you are very careful there is no way to know ahead of time if you play scrabble do not buy this unit i returned it the day after i received it and ordered the more expensive paper white which is compatible with scrabble,it is not compatible with my favorite kindle game scrabble i returned it
2.0,light and handy but not readable in low light,disappointed with low light reading
4.0,not my favorite way to read books bought for a specific book will continue to try but like a book in my hands it is convenient to carry but so are paperbacks purchased at best buy but bought insurance through amazon and very prompt service i got a stylus at best buy but am not sure how kindle works unhappy that i cant get books at harlequin and deals through them might try to get an upgraded one that would work but not sure if kindle fire would be better,not my favorite way to read books
2.0,a couple of issues i have with this model one not possible to read at night or in the dark primary time when i read two cannot adjust font size of home screen and store,a couple of issues i have with this model 
3.0,i love the kindle technology so of course im going to love this kindle only reason i got it was because my old kindle randomly died i honestly hate the touch technology and really hated that the only thing available was a touch but itll do its more bulky then the nontouch kindles too satisfied but unsatisfied at the same time just because i knew what the kindle used to be,it works
1.0,no color very difficult to navigate  if it had a way to go to homepage from bookattempted to download a game now realize that wasnt an option with this model,i loved my kindle fire im spoiled
4.0,the devise was very good once i learned to navigate it not being a nerd in electronics i usually have a few problems learning to get through the operations of such all in all i was pleased with the reader so thanks much,self education
3.0,i cant read at night upset because the week after i purchased this one they placed the kindle paperwhite at a lower price would have preferred to have that offer earlier,i cant read at night upset because the week 
2.0,i was disappointed with my purchasebut it was my own fault i returned it and ordered a kindle paper white which is what i wanted in the first place duh i really didnt like it because it was not really readable i much prefer my kindle fire to it but im perfectly happy with my new paper white thank you,where was my head
1.0,i did not like kindle 6 glarefree for two reasons 1 i was not able to rotate the the pdf i uploaded cant increase the font size 2 in day time cloudy weather i was not able to read the book at full brightness,i did not like kindle 6 glarefree for two reasons
1.0,i could not find any way to get to the menu and it was too difficult i was expecting it to be somewhat like my other one i want to return it but i dont know how can you help me,i was expecting it to be somewhat like my other one
5.0,i love it i resisted the kindle for a long time because i love printed books but now i am a konvert the instant book delivery is seductive and the touch screen is entirely intuitive makes it easy to read in bed too i took it on a 9 day road trip and it is so easy to carry and takes up so little space i am a backpacker and this will save weight when i take it out in the woods plus the battery lasts for days without needing a recharge recharging is fast too,why did i wait so long
1.0,will not connect to kindle store after 30 minutes with tech support they said they would try to fix software problem in three to five days why not just send a new new one overnight,will not connect to kindle store after 30 minutes 
4.0,i loveee my kindle i had been wanting one for a long time even though i have an ipad reading with the kindle feels like really reading a book the screen is crisp like a book and my eyes get less sore the only con would be that sometimes it feels a little bit slow but thankfully not reading per se rather browsing web and using the main screen,loveeeee
1.0,i am really disappointed that i cant replace my current kindle with a comparable device very lightweight simple no touch screen i will have to look for another source of books,bring back simple light nontouch screen reader
5.0,i recently purchased the amazon kindle with a 6” touchscreen and wifi capabilities i would highly recommend this product to anyone who is a book lover or traveler there are several features of the kindle that i enjoy the glarefree screen quick download times battery life and tools available while readingthe kindle’s glarefree screen is great for reading outside on sunny days unlike the ipad you don’t need to worry about a glare coming off the screen making it hard to read however should you want to used an ipad all of your books are available using the kindle app reading from the tablet instead of a book is also nice to have for beach reading there is nothing worse than a book full of sandi was shocked when my books downloaded so fast they downloaded just as quickly any app would download on your phone i found this very impressive considering how many gbs of space is used to download books to a device the quick download speed really comes in handy if you are at an airport and want to buy a book before a flight keep in mind the kindle has wifi access not 3g this means you must be in a location with wifi to purchase and download booksnothing is more frustrating than needing to constantly be charging your electronic devices you should be able to go a few days without needing to charge your kindle this depends of course on how much you use it during the day when you travel you may need to charge it more frequently than when you do not because you will be reading on it more this is one of my favorite features as i find myself charging my iphone and ipad at least once a day even when i’m not using them much throughout the dayfinally there are some very helpful tools that can be used while reading i find the dictionary to be very useful whenever you come across a word that you do not know you can highlight it and look it up right then along with this there is a highlighting tool you can highlight passages in the book you are reading and what other readers highlighted as welli give this product 5 stars and i hope my fellow book lovers find this product as great as i do,great product for book lovers
1.0,not user friendly selling it if anyone interested like new with cover and sylus cheap have one star because it wouldnt let me post a review without a rating hence the one star,wouldnt but another
5.0,they have dramatically improved the responsiveness since the last kindle touch i looked at it is now usable this is for my son and he has done great with the books on it being able to check out books from my library and knowing he cant do anything else on it besides read yes i have disabled the experimental browser love it,great new version
2.0,does not light up so u can read outside in evening which makes no sense touch screen is not that great its ok but i like reading on my samsung gal 5 better even tho its smaller,touch screen is not that great its ok but i like reading on my 
4.0,no issues with kindle itselfworks finenice featuresfairly easy to usemy only complaint is that it should come with at least a thin instruction bookletnot every one wants to go online to follow instructionsalso the adaptor plug should be included with the purchase of a kindlei cant believe that amazon cannot afford to throw in a piece that probably cost them a dime or less to makeit would be good customer servicerather than milking the customer for an additional 8 not kool,works fine nice features
2.0,i purchased this gave it to a nephew and bought a fire not knowing it could not get single issues of the new york times fire is not an eink device so i attempted to buy this again the headline read limitedtime offers for prime members only 30 off kindle 7999 4999 30 off kindle paperwhite 11999 8999 50 off kindle voyage 19999 14999 but when i went to check out it was full price i am a prime member another poster said the discount only shows up at the end i didnt guess this so i wound up not buying it all this has made me leery about buying other amazon electronics like echo or fire stick 4516 full disclosure i am a geezer who spent 15 years in an industry whose primary purpose was to put ink on paper,discount allegedly shows up at the end of the transaction
5.0,in my location it was hard to connect to wifi sometimes with the new kindle it is so quick and easy to get books have loved having a kindle since my family gave me one as a gift after they first came out the glare free screen helps when outside,with the new kindle it is so quick and easy to get books
4.0,the product is great the only problem it does not have ilumination so reading on aplane is impossible my old model had a lamp incorporated into the cover simple and effective,the product is great the only problem it does not have ilumination
5.0,i love this when i pick this device up i know i can relax because i dont use it for anything except reading no internet no fb no popups no whistles dings and notifications just a relaxing time,i love my kindle
3.0,got a headache while setting it up does not have light its black ink on gray screen exchanging it for the unfortunately more expensive paperwhite which has light settings,disappointed screens too dark
4.0,i have only had the kindle for a week i have to admit that reading ebooks is easier than on my 7 tablet a nice to have would be a little more contrast between the background and the text i did not see any way to change it big downside of kindle is that i have over 400 unprotected epub books that kindle doesnt support so for now my tablet will remain as my goto device as i choose not to purchase these books again,almost there
2.0,not user friendly for me love my klndle 2 tried to transfer my games but didnt happen my kindle 2 is wearing out so i dont have a choice customer support not all that good,love my klndle 2
3.0,exactly what i wanted i already have a kindle fire hd but wanted something lighter to carry to work and wanted glare free for outdoor reading this is perfect and the price was good too got on sale for 57bought nov 2014 now mar 2016 and it just stopped working i do not use it every day still have paperbacks i read and on trips i take my kindle fire for gamesinternetbooks so i am a little disappointed that this stopped working a little over a year into lighter usage than my kindle fire,a little over a year and stopped working
5.0,i have kindles in about every room i have wore three out i love all paperwhites they make reading better the search feature alone is great the ultimate is the voyage inproduct my opinion no negatives only positives,great product the kindle
5.0,great,five stars
5.0,luv it,perfect
4.0,great ereader you see all the hype on other ereaders that make you wonder what the difference between it and a tablet is i dont need to access the internet and other crazy things from my book i wanted my reader to be exactly like a book which it is the only fancy thing with this reader is that it does have a dictionary xray and wiki xray lets you look deeper into the book if it is supported it does have goodreads integrated so you can add the book to a shelf and give it a star rating though i havent figured out if you can update your progress or not only had it for a week so far it does not have actual internet no backlighting and no pageturning buttons it is lighweight about the size of a paperback book i have actually caught myself grabbing the top corner as if i were going to turn the page this is an awesome basic ereader if you tend to read in bed like i do buy a book light to go with it i would recommend this to every avid reader,great ereader for paperbook lovers
5.0,great,five stars
3.0,my rating is heavily influenced by my expectation that this would be a step up from my kindle keyboard which died at 5 years of age the new kindle is not as comfortable in the hand i just dont love the touch screen and it is only for reading i actually find the touch screen kind of annoying personal preference also on the negative side and a warning to other buyers if you enjoy active content you wont be able to use it on this device i played every word pretty much every day on my kindle keyboard received a paperwhite as a gift and discovered active content is not compatible after a lengthy phone call and being assured by an amazon kindle expert that i could play the game on this model i exchanged the paperwhite active content is not compatible with this model i dont know why their expert assured me it was its another annoyance and it seems kind of stupid that amazon would take away the ability to use their own material the only way you can use active content now is on certain kindle models only available through thirdparty sellers on the plus side the screen is easy to read for anyone who has eye issues with backlit devices this is a nice nonglare reading experience there are different fonts and sizes to choose from this is the first time i have been so seriously disappointed with a buying experience from amazon and its really left a bad impression the paperwhite was given as a thoughtful gift to replace my beloved keyboard however the gift giver wanted me to be able to play my game and read so encouraged me to call to arrange an exchange for one that would do what i wanted i made the decision to replace it with this model on the advice of an expert who apparently wasnt i was disappointed again so all in all if you only want to read and cant take led or backlit screens this is an ok tool for those purposes as a ps why was the keyboard eliminated some people liked it repair services would have been a great option also im sure there are others out there who dont feel the newer models are all an improvement,for reading only
2.0,this does not come with instructions they are on the kindle but good luck trying to find them im having a difficult time figuring this out the screen is also smaller than i expected,difficult to use
1.0,be careful i ordered a kindle whose description was certified refurbished kindle with special offers current generation i ordered a 7th generation cover for it but it didnt fit amazon even registered it to my account as a 7th gen turned out when i asked customer service what the issue was that they checked the serial number and it was a 2nd generation even though that is not what was advertised i paid about 65 for it and the brand new 7th gen is about 79 seems a small discount for a give generation difference i pointed this out to customer service and they just said there is not much difference and offered no compensation or other options besides oops well have to fix that listing still false advertising to me not happy,not happy
1.0,hard to read at night book lights hard to attach,one star
5.0,i had one of the oldschool kindles with the keyboard on the bottom and when it died i was afraid to upgrade so i have had to adjust to the touch reader this is a great reader with a easyviewing screen and the new technology ink makes the type easier to read it is also lighter so i can read in bed longer than i should,easy reader
1.0,i hate it and will probably return it i dont like seeing all the books you want to sell me i want a separate guide to useage not on the kindle i want a bookletthat is easy to browse i cant get back to the book im trying to read it keeps putting me ahead when im trying to get to the beginning i dislike the cloud i could go on and on but this should be enough the original basic kindle was so user friendly this is not,impossible to enjoy
4.0,i like the kindle great for reading especially like being able to adjust font size i live on a sailboat so its great to be able to have lots of books without having to have a place to store hard copies things i dont like 1 the battery charge does not last for weeks id say perhaps 810 hours 2 it takes a long time to for it to charge most of a day 3 its a bit hard to find a place to hold it so i dont touch the screen and change pages 4 wish it just had a list of my books rather than the actual book covers i have to scroll though many pages just to find a book also you have to enter the page number of the book list would be better if you could just touchswipe to get to the next page 5 hate the underlininghighlighting of passages that i assume was made by other readers i dont underlinehighlight yet many of the new books i get already have that 6 hate that the screen spontaneously comes on with some suggested book i think that is part of the problem with it using the charge up so fast i find it with the screen on with a suggested book 7 please skip giving me unrequested book suggestions you dont have a clue what i want,like it except for the things i dont like
1.0,i was very disappointed with this kindle the lighting is poor too dark and no way to lighten the screen there are no cases that fit this particular kindle that have a light attached,i was very disappointed with this kindle
4.0,a book fanatic with an extensive library who truly loved hardback books it took me awhile to finally try out a kindle i was hooked with the first book the ease and convenience of my kindle is wonderful my reason for 4 stars instead of 5 i wish i could download library books directly to my kindle without signing into amazon to complete the process very happy i finally made the transition,kindle 6 glare free touch screen wish i hadnt taken so long to convert
2.0,i think it is unfortunate that amazon wants to squeeze extra money from the consumer to eliminate commercial advertisement i am increasingly more dissatisfied with amazon as time goes by,too bad for ads so sorry amazon is so poor
5.0,while it would be nice to have a larger viewing screen this kindle is nice im not sure what extra features amazon is talking about but the kindle itself is nice i love the antiglare screen that makes it easy to read when i am on the beach in the sun its lightweight and i dont have to worry about the bulk when packing my beach bag,while it would be nice to have a larger viewing screen
5.0,it will work really well it is a slightly smaller one has a keyboard in it instead of on it below on the kindle as yet i have not used it to order books but am very pleased with it,but am very pleased with it
5.0,i have had 2 other kindles prior to this one no there was nothing wrong with them i still have one of them and gave the other to a friend that didnt have one i love the touch screen my only regret and this is on me not on kindle i think i should have got the paper white recently traveling with some friends wanting to read in a hotel room after they went to bed i was wishing i had the back light i guess i will just have to purchase a new book light i love love love this kindle,great product
1.0,i had an old kindle and thought it was time for an upgrade i was not impressed the newer version seems cheap like a childs toy i an returning it and will keep using my old kindle,not worth the money
4.0,its very good for the price but for the additional price for a hdx fire the added features are a bargain thats just my take since i already have a 7 hdx fire this reader is a perfect addition in fact this reader doesnt glare in direct sunlight the hdx does i really wish that books could be transferred between the two without going through the cloud sometimes being without wifi but for just a plain ereader this unit works very well especially with its ties to amazoncom and kindle books,its very good for the price
3.0,i got it in 49 usd in primedaypros light convenient good for eyes compare to ipadcons didnt come with a charger it flashes every time i click thats the designi dont understand why ppl will pay 200 usd to buy just a reader similar like this higher end version i think 49 usd is fair as it is just for reading thats all i like my purchase but i dont think it shd charge too much for just a simple function reader,good for eyes compare to ipad
4.0,my 12 year old granddaughter was very excited to get the kindle as it was just what she wanted it was delivered on time and in excellent shape the only reason i didnt give it 5 stars was that it did not come with a charger i suspect if i had read the fine print more closely i would have noticed the lack but i didnt so it was a little bit awkward when she wanted to try the kindle immediately on christmas and couldnt as it comes uncharged i was saved by her finding another charger that would work,wonderful product but no charger
5.0,i got this by mistake thinking it was the paper white kindle which i am use to and i love when i saw that it wasnt my husband decided he would like it and has fallen in love with it so as long as it is a kindle i am good we can send books back and forth and all and we are both happy it makes my life much easier since i am so used to reading on my kindle i really dont like looking at books and magazines when he wishes me to read an article now he can just send it to my kindle fromantic his kindle awesome,works well for us
1.0,i cannot figure out if i can brighten the screen so i have to have my lamp on to read at night the book did not mention if it could be lightened i should haveordered another kindle fire,i cannot figure out if i can brighten the screen 
4.0,i love this kindle it is my first one i like the glare free screen it works as advertised in the sun i love highlighting and taking notes as well as looking up words in the dictionary i dislike that i cannot read on it without an external light i wish it had a setting to allow me to turn on a light so i could see it while lying in bed or on a plane finally i wonder what will happen to my notes and highlighting of nonfiction text if this kindle dies is there a way to save them,i love this kindle
4.0,i like how this device makes it easy to carry a lot of reading material in a compact and lightweight form i dont find it as convenient as a paper book for skimming or reviewing what ive read,good for reading on the move
5.0,i bought this on a whim i have an ipad that i have always used to read books on i started having wrist and arm pain and i traced it back to holding the ipad for hours it seems silly but i just got annoyed with the weight of it so i bought the kindle fell in love and weve been happily ever after since its lightweight no glare and i can read outside in the bright light love that feature i havent quite figured out how to find books online and get them using only the kindle i usually find them on my computer then download on the kindle its how ive always done it so no problem there it didnt take me longer than 10 minutes to figure out how to set it up use it and download my books on my kindle account my kids still cant believe im cheating on apple but i love this little thing,bought on a whim but i love it
2.0,im disappointed that the new kindles dont have an audio feature i would prefer a heavier somewhat bulkier kindle with the audio this is so useful when driving or working around the home,im disappointed that the new kindles dont have an audio feature
5.0,i will have to say i like this better than the paperwhite the light of the paperwhite burned my eyes and i couldnt read more than 10 pages at a time this products display actually feels like a real book now i can read for hours,better than paperwhite
4.0,a fabulous starter for our child im wishing now that we got one that lights up but that has nothing to do with the product itself we would totally make this purchase again but would upgrade,happy child
4.0,i like it yet there are no instructions except in it which is a problem if you miss them i wish they werent completely touch not everyone likes or can use touch my girlfriend is physically disabled and can use hers with the buttons i hope it never breaks she cant use touch i was happy with the price deal when i bought it cool device over all will they ever make them bigger tho,i like it yet there are no instructions except in it
1.0,love my old kindle absolutely hate this new touchscreen versionamazon please read the negative reviews i agree with most of what peopleare sayingits harder to move between pages esp onehanded andthe touchscreen is too sensitive creating all sorts of problems pleasebring back or at least offer the buttons on the side version you arepissing off a lot of amazon customers and lest you forget there areother viable options the nook apple products etc i say this sincerelyas i am a long time amazon customer please reconsider,amazon please read hate hate hate this new touchscreen
4.0,i upgraded from the 1st generation of kindle with hardware buttons this is a great upgrade still same size and almost same weight the touch screen is much better i havent experienced the accidental page turn or zoom inout typing is much easier now the only problem i see is not sure how to look up a multiword item in dictionary since the dictionary pops up when you long press on a word i still think its the best book reader out there,quick review great product best book reader
3.0,i preferred the old model this seems too delicate mainly the screen i preferred the one with the keyboard and the buttons in my view it was more user friendly and stronger,new kindle hd7
5.0,got my newest kindle and i love it so much smaller than my first one or my second one but i love it its going to be great for taking along where ever i go and i can just read any where again my last one i had quit some years ago and had the keyboard you wont miss the keyboard on this at all you can still type in searching what you want from the top in search bar like being on computer im working on putting more books on it from my old one little each day,kindle 6 glarefree touchscreen display wifi includes special offers
1.0,this worked fine until it didnt and then amazon customer service instead of helping had me reset my device so i lost all my severalhundreddollarsworth of content and then hung up on me,watch out crappy customer service when device fails
3.0,this is the 2nd kindle i bought the first one was a couple of years ago and about the same price i like the older one better the new one seems ok until you compare it to the older version maybe i should have bought the one with the light but the older one was not marketed as lighting up i will keep but dont be fooled by the term paper white because it is sort of grey,maybe white but not bright
4.0,was ok,four stars
1.0,amazon you have to do better navigation is not intuitive and pages dont go forward and backwards trouble free not worth the price and amazon is better off giving it away as a free gift than charging money for it,amazon you have to do better navigation is not intuitive and pages dont go 
5.0,5 star,love it
5.0,aaa,five stars
2.0,one of the best things about the kindles has been the simple yet addictive word games games like every word every word crossing etc were free fabulous and used by me daily there is no mention of the fact that theyve discontinued all active content in the latest paperwhite but let me assure you its gonenot only that but the screen imo is a step back from the 6th edition which i loved sadly i lost mine in an airport and had to get a 7th gen to replace it when the first paperwhite came out it had terrible mottled lighting on the bottom but they fixed that in the 6th edition yay well its back in the 7th edition in addition the screen is less responsive the lighting isnt as good and its just not as easy to read regardless of what amazons marketing may sayive loved every kindle ive had until now sadly this upgrade really feels like a letdown im sure theyll come out with an 8th edition so they can get people like me to spend another 120 sighamazon bring back active content and stop mucking with the screenupdate january 2016 my kindle has started acting wonky now when i tap for a page turn it sometimes takes over two seconds to turn the page ive rebooted to no avail it still functions but now the distraction is breaking my revery from whatever im reading ive docked another star because this has become a huge disappointment honestly the best thing about this kindle is the cool leather case i bought for it im considering following a commenters advice and buying a used older one,does not support games
5.0,i love this really do not understand all the negative reviews anti glare is perfect the dialogue part is nice and dark so you can read it you can adjust the lettering to your liking its stays charged it seems like forever lightweight you can hold it in one hand pages turn with a touch of a finger that is the best i still have my old one its like 4 years old now with the side buttons and always disliked it this one is 100 better to read with trust me,love this kindle
5.0,awesome,five stars
4.0,i really love my new ereader i read much more and more often my only complaint is that i still need a light to use it for instance i cant read it in the evenings outdoors i will probably upgrade to a paperwhite soon,lots of pluses
5.0,i enjoy,five stars
5.0,i bought this for my 21 year old daughter thats going through some medical issues that require a lot of appointments and waiting shes an avid reader and kindle is a great way to take advantage of our prime membership and save money on books as stated it is a smaller model thats what she needs to toss in a bag or purse she loves it i own another kindle product and have enjoyed it as well,kindle e readers are still a great gift
4.0,love it,four stars
5.0,excellent product its small multi functional but simple the glare free aspect sold itself and although ive always enjoyed reading in the past i have increased my reading by more than 50 because of its convenience font selections and ease of use i recommend this to anyone who wants to enjoy reading from something thats just right and without paying a ridiculous amount of money for all of the extra stuff which would be a distraction anyway,exactly what i needed
5.0,pefect,five stars
5.0,love it portable light longlasting battery glare free screen affordable price got mine on a lightning deal for 50does not have a backlightwhich i thought would be a hassle but so far it really hasnt impacted me at all i never use the little clip on light i got to go with it in fact,kindle is a keeper
2.0,not sure what i think since im computer illiterate these things take me a while to learn my way around them have only had this new one 3 days and am having problems finding my way around all i want it for is to read books dont know anything about a cloud im confused it reads fine once i get my book loaded,it reads fine once i get my book loaded
5.0,ive been reading kindle books on tablet and phones for years and put off getting an actual kindle though ive coveted them until this touchscreen version came out i absolutely love it easy to hold easy to read i love just holding it in my hand and sitting on the front porch reading i find myself wanting to read on here more than my phone love my touchscreen kindle,love it
1.0,can not start it i do know the langard you use to use it you sent no instrustion sorry i ever ordered it i keep telling you this but send nothing here no mail or email you know how to sent,can not start it i do know the langard 
5.0,i love this as its so light to hold anyone with arthritic pains in your fingers or wrist will appreciate it its a little different from the regular one as it has no backlight so in the evening must be read under a light but its great to take to a doctors office and light to carry only thing i dislike are the ads for other books and you cant beat the price,good kindle
1.0,dont buy this device unless you are okay reading ebooks without page numbers i used a nook for almost four years and every book had a page number there is no reason why kindle cannot do likewise,beware no page numbers
5.0,very pleased with my kindle i am getting used to using it some times the back lighting seems a bit dim for reading in the dark i thought that there might be a way to adjust it but i dont see this option,very pleased with my kindle
5.0,love my new kindle,five stars
3.0,was somewhat disappointed the good news is that the screen is a good size for reading and it is very light to hold however the screen is rather dark for reading even in sunlight and the only adjustment available is the background color doesnt help they have also placed the power button on the bottom of the kindle again the book keeps turning itself off when i hold it in one hand which is supposed to be the point of it being lightweightthis particular issue is the most annoying,a good try but could have done better
2.0,much smaller than before somehow attempts to get book have not worked so i do not know how the print will show up when i have successfully gotten a book i hope i find my original kindle somewhere,kindle review
1.0,i could not get it to recharge very disappointed and i just put it in the trash as i feel like that was what it was what little time it worked i enjoyed just felt liked i wasted my money ,junk
4.0,the only problem i have with the new kindle is the choices of font sizes i had a kindle keyboard that broke which is why i purchased the new kindle the font sizes jump from barely big enough for me to see with my bifocules to huge a step in between sizes 6 7 would be perfect otherwise everything is easy to navigate,a step in between sizes 6 7 would be perfect otherwise everything is easy to navigate
4.0,bought the entry level kindle when it was on sale i wasnt sure id like a reading only device but i hate reading on the iphone too small a screen and didnt want to lug around a heavier tablet and my iphone besides the heavier tablet would aggravate my carpal tunnel just holding a book or newspaper does so i knew the extra weight would be taxing ive used an ipad several times and frankly dont find them all that useful for me but the kindle seems to suit mei ride the subways of nyc to get to and from work and find that the kindle is very easy to use lightweight and doesnt bother my hands it also is very easy to read easy on the eyes as it doesnt shoot light up into my eyes as a tablet does,i like it and it doesnt bother my carpal tunnel
4.0,great offer great value i mostly do reading its a kindle after all on this unit but checking email gmail facebook and twitter makes it very handy would like to see it hold a charge longer average threefour days between charges but love form factor and ruggedness overall very pleased,i loved the offer installment payments
5.0,love the new 7th generation kindle ereader already own the older button operated one enjoy that one as well if you want or need a tablet the fire will work just fine for you but if reading is your primary usage nothing beats the kindle ereader easy control of font size makes it very adaptable to each individual the nonglare screen really does work ive read a lot from people who have an issue with the touch screeni dont very easy to use user friendly no its not designed for color printed graphic novels or comic books but for reading books its great a definite addition if you travel or fly a lotjust download the books before you go read away,love the new 7th generation kindle ereader
4.0,purchased it during black friday deal had kindle touch new kindle paperwhite so compared to the previous ones i had i think this is by far the best value deal the resolution isnt so bad for reading and the processing speed has gotten faster than kindle touch i also like the squarely simple design which in my opinion is much better to gripfor 49 i believe im getting the best reading experience i ca getone drawback though is that the touch screen is infrared style durning normal reading time it doesnt make any difference but when putting down the device beside the pillow after reading with a just a touch from the blanket or my hair causes the screen to turn the page or change the font size even when i cover the screen with a cloth or a paper to protect from screen damage it senses touch and responses to it quite annoying especially when using kindle this one after being used to the touch style of paperwhite so thats one star offbut for those who wants simple reading device this is the it,love the price functionality and speed hate infrared touch screen that responds not just to my finger but to every contact of
4.0,this is a very solid product i got the special offer and decided to it would be a great opportunity to try out an ereader before moving on to a more advanced model i must say the screen is very easy to read the interface while a bit laggy is very concise and the featureset is surprisingly robust for the base model,a great entry level ereader
5.0,i love to read and i have resisted going to an ereader as i am old fashioned and like to hold a book as the cost of buying even paperbacks has risen so high i cannot afford to pay for my habit i tried my daughterinlaws kindle and found i could handle laying in bed to read as i often do in addition my local library carries a few thousand books for kindle that are free just like checking out a book i just got it for christmas so i havent tested all the possibilites but i am really please so far,i love to read and i have resisted going to an

5.0,the first one i was sent had a touchscreen issue so they replaced it immediately i have fallen completely in love with my kindle touch 79 base model the ads are based on the books in my kindle library and i find them a brilliant way to pick my next read they are also only on the first page of the homepage in coverview so they are incredible unobtrusive im infatuated and cannot praise this product highly enough,ads not a problem
4.0,perfect,four stars
5.0,i found there were lots of books that i wanted but i couldnt get through interlibrary loan and the actual books were much more expensive i have found a number of great selfpublished authors for cheap or free the only thing i dont love is that background is gray and i wonder if it would have been worth it to buy the paperwhite as the background appears to be more like paper,just the basics but it does what i want

4.0,i dont have wifi i expected to download e books to my computer and transfer them to the kindle but the process was much more complex than i expected and it took about 2 hours of live chat and two chatlive experts to finally accomplish it the chat line helped because the second person was an expert in kindle and i was able to ask the person for clearer explanationsi hope the 2nd half of the transcript from that whole chat will help me to repeat the process the next time i want to download a book,i dont have wifi i expected to download e

5.0,i use it a lot when im only going to be reading and using the hdx mainly for tablet use i usually read before going to sleep and i really like the touchscreen for that not only is it lighter and easy to hold but i find that i go to sleep much easier after reading with it than i do with the hdx it must be because there is no light in it shining back at me and its the greatest for tossing in my purse on the way out no matter where im going,i wouldnt trade it

5.0,this has changed the way i read i purchased this right after christmas for 20 off thanks for the sale amazon ive read 3 books already and its only late januaryi had intended to purchase the paperwhite but a report came out just before christmas from the medical community warning the use of blue light devices at night such as the kindles with lights paperwhite included i find that i can see just fine the old fashioned way with a bedside lamp or i think you can buy a clip on light for the kindle if you are concerned with keeping your spouse up while you readlove the product it is so light and fits into my purse,great purchase

5.0,friends got me this for christmas they felt it time for me to move into the 21st century i was a bit hesitant at first when youve been reading real books as long as i have you wonder how a little etch a sketch wannabe could take the place of an actual paper book well ive had time to do some reading on it and i have to admit its pretty neat i am alternating now between real books and my kindle i cant imagine ever giving up real paper books but who knows i think anyone who likes to read would appreciate this little devil buy one today or ask for one as a present,welcome to the 21st century

5.0,great device received this as a christmas gift from my wife because i want to get back into some regular reading but im terrible about carrying a book with me this is slim lightweight and fits easily into my computer bag or anywhere really the screenpages are clear and crisp i also like the fact that i can download my own documents onto it so if i want i can load work related info that i typcially would review on my hefty laptopmy wife got the special offers version which has advertising on the opening screen and home page but not in the book pages i would prefer not to have the ads but since they are only visable when in standby mode or on the home page i can live with that if i really get tired of them they can always be turned off with a 20 extra charge my wife got the unit new at a special christmas cost of 59 with the ads so i cant complain at that price,great device fits my needs perfectly
5.0,dont quite know everything about it but so far its great real deal for the price the ads are that bad dont affect reading its got good touch sensitivity some screen features are small but no more so than smartphones yet no problem use a stylus i use a dowel stick fine read up on it and when you buy youll see its as good as amazon says,shouldve bought one sooner
3.0,very nice if you dont ad a lot of your own notes if you do it slows waaaay down but kindle is basically the only realistic choice out there just dont try to talk to your books on this machine,very nice if you dont ad a lot of your own

3.0,great reading tool the best out there major issue i have is with my home wifi it is a hit and miss connection in a good days it will connect to my network in about 23 seconds after i turn it on on a bad day it will not connect at all such as the case while im writing this initially ive purchased 2 of the basic kindles for valentines day for me and my wife the wifi problems started with both devices on the first day ive called customer service and was advised to update the software i did the update but that didnt help much as both devices were with onoff relationship with my home network from there ive spent countless hours on the phone during the next couple of days with customer service training to fix the problem the last time ive spoken with them i was instructed to use a specific code on the device which pulled up all the recorded data for the device including any issues with the wifi i was able to forward this data to the technician who told me that once reviewed he will call me and let me know how to proceed that was about a month ago and im still waiting meanwhile i decided the problem is within the model itself so ive ordered 2 new devices of the more advanced paperwhite version and returned the other two the problem has appeared on both new devices again couple of hours after ive opened the boxes i have not called customer service again on the new devices the reason is that im tired of spending time on the phone explaining what is the problem and begging for help on the good side i now know my 10 digit wifi password given to me from fios and can tell it without looking it seems that every time i call the rep has a quick fix to connect me to my wifi which works for couple of hours may be after that we are back to hit and miss i now know how to connect the devices to the wifi restart my router and restart the device there are days that even that do not workbut there is always tomorrow however i dont see this as a particularly convenient waythis should not be an issue for a device of such level bottom line im keeping the devices as i really enjoying them as readers my wife doesnt care about the wifi as many people probably dont even with the wifi issue in hopes that the next update will fix the issue,great reading device bad wifi capabilities

4.0,i really like my kindle i love that fact that it is glarefree so when im on vacation at the pool i can still read it like a normal book the only reason i gave it 4 stars was i wish there was a lightdimmer setting it would be nice to be able to brighten the background when im in a darker location,i love the glarefree

5.0,this is exactly what i needed without all the bells and whistles i just wanted a kindle for reading purposes only i read the description exactly comparing it to other kindles and their benefits not a tablet no facebook no lighted screen etc this is small i like it because my hands are very tiny actual paperback books hurt my hands if i have to hold them in the same position to long until its time to turn the page this dimensions make it easier for me to hold than a regular book changing pages is easy as swiping a finger and there is a ton of free ebooks to choose from i love thisthis is a perfect simple ereader no bells and whistles easy navigation,i like it because my hands are very tiny
1.0,screen is too sensitive and takes forever to shut off it has locked up a couple of times forcing a restart also doesnt keep very good accounting of prime books on unit at times will change pages if you hold side of it black housing too stronglythanksjim perry,also doesnt keep very good accounting of prime books on unit
2.0,i bought the kindle fire 8 and was excited to see a much lower priced tablet on offer be advised for those avid readers like myself the kindle marketplace for books is a total ripoff for instance i looked for books i already had in paperbacks as i like to reread my favorite series i found that the same ebooks were the same price or more as the paperbacks i already owned this is bs for those who want to read new books andor have their favorites that they want to read this is not for you again the ebook marketplace is a total ripoff,for those avid readers like myself the kindle marketplace for books is a

4.0,i like it surprisingly well i like the category options makes finding my favorite books very easy i find reading it to be more difficult than the kindle dx it replaces it seems dark to me yes i know it isnt back lit but neither was the dx i like the touch screen and im finding my way around the menus,ok not as easy to read as my dx
4.0,so far only 2 days i like it it works pretty much the same as my nook with just small differences some features that nook doesnt have that this does like xray i like would have to wait a while until i have had a chance to use it fefore i can give a proper review,just got it so preliminary review

4.0,i put this kindle side by side with the paperwhite in good lighting the brightness of the screens are fairly identical as the paperwhite adjusts to the light within your environment the darker the room the more prominent the light i do like to read in bed and find that lamp light is sufficient when using this kindle however i must admit that the backlight on the paperwhite is a nice feature and very convenient i got this kindle around valentines day on sale for 5999 and theres no way im returning it unless it malfunctions ill purchase a book light and use it as a backup reader if nothing else on the mechanical side its very sensitive and at times skips a few pages when i tap to advance to the next page from reviews of the paperwhite which was 9999 at the time of my purchase of this kindle the paperwhite has the same issue its a little frustrating trying to get back to your place in the book overall this kindle is a good ereader i recommend that you really evaluate your reading habits before you purchase this kindle if youre used to holding a physical book then theres not much difference here just adjust the light in your environment as usual its lightweight easy to transport and has every feature the paperwhite offers with the exception of the backlight and the higher price tag its also easy on the eyes especially for someone who sits in front of bright computer screen all day and desire to give their eyes a break overall i give this kindle 4 stars it is what it is ,it is what it is

4.0,first things first i like it a lot very readable and light enough to hold comfortably in one hand on the metro for prolonged periods second thing is a question for which the jury is still out are special offers worth saving 20 bucks make no mistake they are ads and they are quite intrusive i thought theyd be on the screen only when the unit was asleep but i was wrong theyre pasted all over the screen along with the books on my kindle as well ill probably get used to navigating around them so im in no hurry to pay the reported 30 dollars to remove them but they get in the way of a fivestar review for now,are special offers worth 20 bucks the jury is still out for me

1.0,would not recommend bought because was advised child friendly for new readersbut way to dark of screen and can not adjust and many books that are on website not compatible witth kindlebut too late to return,not happy
5.0,i love reading on my kindle this is the 3rd one ive owned and it is far better for reading than the ipad or other color tablets at least for reading books magazines may be a different story but i find it is very hard on my eyes to read on a backlit screen the kindles paperwhite screen is easy on the eyes and the extra features like the dictionary ability to highlight buying online and getting books instantly you cant beat it being able to carry several books on such a small and light device is great for traveling,i love reading on my kindle
4.0,this kindle is very light and easy to read for the most part what should be more prominent in the description is that there is no backlight you have to use an independent source of light thats a little ridiculous for everyone who reads in bed at night if i had realized this had no backlight i would have purchased the next version up,no backlight
3.0,pretty good over the old kindle keyboard but with some caveatsno ability to put books into a collection and have them display that wayno physical buttons to go back and forthnot a rubberized back but a cheap hard plastic backother than that its much faster and page turning works well with the ir curtainits a tough place to be because i wonder what the paperwhite version is like then i think why dont i just get a tabletbest not to think about,its ok
5.0,i like being able to carry my library in my pocket i was surprised by the lack of back light this kindle reads exactly like the printed page the black and white format is no problem because most of my books are printed in black and white this is my first e reader and i am loving it,i like being able to carry my library in my pocket
4.0,i bought it on amazon day for about 50 and although im glad i did i wouldnt pay more than what i did for it glarefree is very nice and i love the matte finish on the black plastic casing but i dont like how theres a big noticeable lag when moving from menus and navigating through it,and although im glad i did
5.0,i love my kindle its my first one and i bought it after i realized how much i missed reading i travel a lot and its not practical to bring books which was always my first choice however after just a day with my kindle im a converterthe touch screen took a half a second to get used to because there is no vibration response that im used to with my smartphone its also a bit slow in the response department in comparison to a smartphone but really its just a teeny tiny adjustment period after that i found it easy to use and an addition to my life that i love,compact lightweight and easy to use
5.0,this works really great but it can be a bit tricky when turning pages sometimes it will turn several pages at once and i have to try to figure out which page im supposed to be on im not sure if it is the kindle or my fingers that are the problem i like the ability to change font size on the fly it makes reading a lot easier im using my kindle several hours daily now for the last several years i could only read print books for a half hour a day or less because of the strain from reading smaller fonts the kindle has freed me from that problem,this works really great but it can be a bit tricky when 
2.0,i got kindle because it has better support for reading other languages than nook older touchscreen version i havent found the reader to my liking when comparing it my nook so far in fact i get frustrated with kindle on its usabilitypros it has more support for nonenglish or western european languages has multiple dictionary for english as well as other languages to choose from vocabulary buildercons not even used for more than a couple of weeks it froze on me i had to restart the system i also lost last read page of my book home page doesnt allow me to go back to my previously read book without searching the book again whenever i navigate say to my cloud or goodread i have to use so many back button to get to where i left off i would think going to the home page would allow me to go back to my book with fewer clicks but no dictionary search limitations  words with dashes or other punctuation are hard to search theres no custom highlight to search words in dictionary  sometimes i need to look up words in dictionary definition too but i cant do that nook has it and i really like the feature where i can search dictionary of words that i dont know everywhere not just the words in the book  custom search sometimes the words you search are not available in regular dictionary or wikipedia but if you modify the search word a little bit it can help but user cannot edit the search word again this is something nook has and i find it very convenient cant disable wifi without going into settings with multiple clicks away from your book then have make more clicks to find your way back to the bookoverall as a reader its not much different than other readers it can improve by increasing dpi making text more clear but other usability is very important too i personally find it hard to use the dictionary usage is very important for someone who is not a native english speaker and need to look up words in dictionary all the time not only the highlighting is rigid not user input to correct the selection and no option for user to search further on new words in definition i simply find it extremely inconvenienti dont think i will buy another kindle in the future,dont like navigation usability
1.0,huge kindleamazon fan now on my third kindle but kindle operating systems are the worse the most recent upgrade is terrible loadingorganizing books has always been painful but impossibly amazon has gone out of their way to make it even worse cant say ill ever buy another kindle,but kindle operating systems are the worse the most recent upgrade is terrible
5.0,love this reader i found that reading from my kindle fire for short times was fine but after working at the computer then coming home and reading all afternoon on the fire screen made my eyes tired i bought this glare free kindle specifically for reading my books for long periods it is much better no frills but great for reading and this is what it was made for glad that amazon made this basic kindle a touch screen now,just great for reading
1.0,dont buy a new kindle if you already have oneit will not have your books on it and getting them on it from the cloud is a tedious bookbybook process that will make you decide to go back to paperi transferred all the old content only my screen was broken via usb from old kindle to new when i tried to open the books i was told they were not authorized on the new device even though it is now registered as my primary deviceafter chatting with 3 customer service agents one of whom told me they would fix the problem by assigning the old serial number to my new kindle and speaking on line with an agent i discovered there is no fix for thissorry folks if you really want to access all those books you own you have to do it onebyone from the cloud and youd better not be someplace where you dont have access to wifi when you want to do itthe stupidity of this defies description since the software fix that would be needed is so obvious and so easy,amazon does not support upgrading to a new kindle youll be sorry if you try

5.0,it is a big improvement over the original kindle i had one of the originals but the battery gave way after many many hours of use by my wife a voracious reader whose final seven years were spent in a nursing home and she simply wore it out in addition to the glare free kindle i bought a kindle fire which i also like very much but i rarely use it as the onoff switch fell off and i have to turn it on or off with a screw driver i really liked the fire better than the ipad,the new glaare free kindle
5.0,bought it as a gift for a relative and she absolutely loved it i knew shes a heavy book reader so i figured what the heck i know she will enjoy this the price of this kindle was pretty good as well most of these things would cost a little above the hundred mark,great buy
5.0,my husband does all his reading on a kindle this one is the first touchscreen one and took a few minutes training but it is great a good basic kindle lightweight easy to use when my original basic kindle bites the dust i will get this one also,love our kindles
5.0,i wasnt sure how i would like using an ereader so decided cheaper was betteri had to really get used to how sensitive the touch screen is and how to use my computer along with the kindle to get the books i enjoyreading is one of the joys of my life and using this i have access to a huge amount of fresh material without dragging books around making a point of going to a library so yeah im now a kindle convert,works like new
4.0,this is my 3rd kindle since their release date several years ago i never leave the house without my kindle i love the kindles the benefits and the flexibility i can download some of my writings onto my kindle so i can proofread while i am out of my office indicate errors make notes and utilize all my time i like the light weight of the kindle 6 and the nonglare screen so i can spend more time outside reading while relaxing,i love the kindles
5.0,i love my kindle so much i bought this one for my daughter to take while studying abroad then we downloaded her textbooks so that she wouldnt have to travel with the heavy weights of school books along with all of her luggage it was worked out great,i love my kindle so much i bought this one for 
3.0,the touchscreen is a mixed blessing while it make the kindle interface more tactile and user friendly especially when zooming it makes the device noticeably bulkier and heavier than the previous model although by no means should it be classified heavy i do like the slicker feel of the previous incarnation,i do like the slicker feel of the previous incarnation
5.0,this is my 3rd kindle i like the improvements made over the last 4 years the touchscreen makes life so much easier maneuvering through the screens is so much easier i just had to get used to downloading my previously purchased books from the cloud and the removing them when i am done takes some getting used to,i like the improvements made over the last 4 years
3.0,liked my old kindle better this is small and light but the all touch screen is annoying keep slipping finger onto screen when reading and i am suddenly at wikipedia etc its explaining the meaning of a word i may have touched accidently already a book disappeared i was in the middle of reading do no know what happened suddenly i had to pick out a new book to read,liked my old kindle better
4.0,the 6 kindle is really still an exceptional reader for the price note the second part of that sentence is the operative part it does have its shortcomings the screen is still distinctly not white on black tending to more of an off grey or brown color with dark grey text and although i had never noticed it before after using a kindle voyage the text is noticeably aliased however page turns are faster than ever and the image sans aliasing is extremely crisp for 79 dollars really it could replace every book in your library and leave you wanting only a little bit over the charm of dead tree hard to beat that,flawed reader great price
2.0,i was very disappointed that this item is not back lit as i love to read in bed at night without the lights on i got it after having a nook which is getting old and starting to have issues i had heard that the kindle was easy and convenient to use i dont know if it is because i am used to using the nook but i found the kindle confusing to use,i was very disappointed that this item is not back lit as i 
1.0,the screen on this device is too dark and cannot be lightened up i was very disappointed when i received it i thought this would be the perfect tablet for just reading books but unfortunately it is going back,screen too dark
1.0,i am a 86 year old lady i bought a kindle i cannot turn the pages why doesnt it come with a book of instructions i own and use an apple computer but cannot understand how this worksshirley,how does this work
3.0,its very easy to use the only set back is why is there no back light you would think the kindles been around a while and would put a backlight on even its most basic model happy but not satisfied but im sure you people will shrug and say oh well buy our higher model,its very easy to use the only set back is why is 
5.0,i love it,five stars
5.0,wonderful,five stars
3.0,its okay,three stars
5.0,i love it,i love it
3.0,it is ok,three stars
5.0,good deal,five stars
4.0,i like it because it is lightweight and very easy to read in daylight it is harder to read by artificial light and of course it does not have an internal light as does the kindle fire i also like it because the charge lasts a long time i find i am always turning pages i suppose there is not as much text on one page as some other models,lightweight and easy to read
5.0,couldnt be happier i have the kindle fire and do love it but its much more suited for videos for a reader it works but it is rather heavy whenever i go anywhere i like to take reading material with me for my downtime now instead of one book i have my whole library its light weight easy to read in the bright outdoors and i connect using my iphone when and if i want to download or purchase a new title i highly recommend it and the price cant be beat,a good companion for the kindle fire
5.0,i love that the newest baseline kindle reader allows for fingerflipping of the pages did i need this perhaps notsince i have the reader on my computer and cell phones yet this reads so nice the letters are big crisp and easy on the eyes navigation is not too difficult and unlike my kindle firethe kids dont steal the readers  thanks amazon for upgrading rather than abandoning your economy reader,pageflipping eyepleasing reader that the kids wont steal
5.0,i can finally read books and save trees lol eink is amazing and the kindle can store many many books internally sometimes i wish i had the paperwhite edition just to have the backlit screen otherwise it is awesome for reading and portable,eink is amazing and the kindle can store many many books internally
5.0,what else can i add that hasnt been said i bought this to read at the beach love that it syncs with my kindle fire so i can pick up where i left off making sure i sync before i leave home because you need a wifi connection i have a kindle fire and a nook color i do prefer to read on those but this is much easier to read in direct sunlight its doing the job that i wanted it to do and it does it very well,love it
3.0,the kindle is perfect for using to read books during my workouts and small enough that i can even hold it as i run laps it is simple to use and i love turning pages with the touch screen rather than the buttons that were on the frame of my old kindle gen 1 i also like the fact that the screen doesnt light up it is very easy on the eyeshowever i am very disappointed with the wifi connectivity it often will not connect and so that makes it hard to look up definitions or use other functions dependent on wifi the experimental browser is useless it just plain does not work i never intended to use the kindle to browse the web but i did want to be able to download books from the library using the kindle but the browser is so bad i have never been able to use it to browse and download library books i have to use my computer or iphone to get library books for the kindle i also wish a power adapter had been included because it is not convenient to charge it on usb the 1999 price amazon charges to buy the power adapter is ridiculously high the kindle cover is also overpriced at 2999 it feels very flimsy a far cry from the nice leather cover the kindle gen 1 hadi bought the kindle at the 99 price and the next day saw it went on sale for 79 i was happy that amazon agreed to give me the sale price retroactively ive seen the kindle on sale more recently at 59 and wish that i had waited to buy it at that price i think 99  and even 79  is too much considering the problems with wifi connectivity and the uselessness of the browserbut all of that said the device itself is very handy for reading electronic books,the kindle is perfect for using to read books during my workouts and 
4.0,i am very happy with this product you cant tell it was a refurb my only complaint was that it didnt have a backlight like shown and described but for a childs first kindle and to continue their love of reading i didnt go wrong,overall very pleased great price
4.0,this replaced my old kindle touch and i really like it i took off one star because it isnt as easy to locate new downloads and place them into collections also i borrow a lot of ebooks from the library and there is nothing to indicate them as borrowed so when i was downloading my library the borrowed books kept making the kindle freeze other than that i am finding it a good device for reading and i do recommend for anyone who wants just an ereader,i like my new kindle
5.0,works great light comfortable to hold the battery lasted two weeks with me using it every day i was worried that the special offers ads would be intrusive but they are not they are never in the reading page only the screen saver a small price to pay for the 20 dollar savings for features vs price it was my best purchase all year,no worries with special offers
5.0,i never wanted one of these because i love the feel of a book however my son daughterinlaw got this kindle for me for christmasand i love it they also bought a vera bradley cover for my kindle so it almost feels like a book im 69 years old and i must say its easier for me to read from my kindle than from a book,great gift

1.0,i emailed and called to request to cancel the order and wanna reorder with new paper white version kindle for the kid the service rep told me the package i ordered was sent with new paper white version so i handed the unit to the kid as christmas gift then my friend stopped by and showed me his paper white version thats totally different one his unit is lighter thinnerbrighter on the screen the service rep didnt communicate the right product spec thats really disappointed,service rep didnt provide the right product spec
1.0,1 the kindle does not have a light which i didnt realize so you have to read it in a bright roomwhich makes it near impossible to use the kindle at the gym while riding the bus in the evening etc2 amazon says you can lend books that you buy but lending is not available for a single book i have purchased so far 2 dozen books which is unacceptable if i bought the actual book i would be able to lend it to anyone at any time,1 the kindle does not have a light which 
5.0,got this for my 7 year old daughters birthday she wanted a kindle just like her big sister she loves it the only problem is that now the older sister wants one with touchscreen also she loves using the kindle and still loves to read physical books too best of both worlds,7 year old thumbs up
1.0,i ordered this kindle on wednesday july 15 2015 for 49 but now i do not see an order in my order history i am very disappointed as this was to be a gift for my mother and now if i plan to do this i have to spend 79 instead very upset and dont understand what happened with my order,cant find my order
5.0,love it i had an old old kindle with the keyboard on the bottom yes the letters were pretty well worn off it worked well until i spilled a glass of water on it i have a kindle fire hd but i dont want to take it to the beach etc i just wanted a reader with wifi that was easy to read this does it i did spring for no ads because they are too annoying happy,love it
5.0,this basic kindle is a great value and i love it its like having any paperback you want to read at your side anytime anyplace the touchscreen works great and is the best ive found for reading in sunny conditions its very booklike and easy on the eyes its not backlit but then again neither are my traditional booksmy current endeavor is learning spanish with the kindle its easy to select words of interest these highlighted words are automatically added to my vocabulary list which i can then review at leisure ¡excelente,great booklike screen
1.0,i was very disappointed in this version of the kindle the touch screen is so sensitive that even just brushing my clothes against it changed the chapter location in the book i was reading my previous years of enjoyment of reading on the kindle was gone due to the erratic behavior of this version after i struggled to read just one book on this new kindle returned it and bought the keyboard version which i am now enjoying using again,what a terrible experience
5.0,when i purchased this it was to replace a kindle generation 4 which came out a few years ago i also own a kindle voyage this kindle was to be what i used when going into the city as a cheaper alternative to traveling with the voyagethe cons compared to the voyage the case feels cheaper its hard plastic with a deep bezel it has no backlightthe pros the kindle is perfectly readable no its not the voyage but its perfectly serviceable as for its lack of backlight that can be remedied by purchasing a case with an external lightit responds relatively quickly to touch and remains light and easy to carry moreover the text is crisp and easy to read although for some odd reason the time to read function has a slightly different time remaining on it for the same book than the voyage does but thats easily fixed too,the kindle
5.0,love it for reading i ordered it through aarp and was supposed to get a 10 discount but did not receive the discount when ordering it never asked for my aarp number i did order this off the aarp site that is the disappointment in ordering this item since i already have a nook the offer of a 10 discount on the kindle ereader drew my attention it is much easier to work with amazon than with barnes and noble when ordering items i was also not happy that i had trouble with the nook recently and was not happy with their attitude,love it for reading
5.0,got this as a gift for my stepfather he is not the most techy guy but he loves this thing he reads all the time and can barely put this reader down he gets books off amazon the local library and other websites too,nice little reader thats easy to use
5.0,bought this for my husband as a gift and he loves it this one has nicer features than the kindle i bought for myself a few years ago but mine has held up so well that i cant justify upgrading this is a sturdy userfriendly product and the battery lasts several days even with heavy use,great product
4.0,i am very pleased with my new kindle it is very light weight and does not tire me to hold it up i would like it more if i could find a stand for it so it could sit on the arm of my chair my other kindle has been with me for years and acts up every now and then,great new kindle
5.0,this is my 4th kindle i had the first one then upgraded then got a kindle fire ive loved them all the kindle fire is great when i travel as i can do email and go on line but it is much larger and heavier this kindle ereader is so small and light weight and has the paper screen i love it for reading it is easy to read fits easily in a purse and the battery lasts forever,ive loved them all

5.0,every okey,five stars
4.0,ive had this for a year now my only complaint about it is it loses its place if i dont exit out to the home menu before closing it for the day love the eink and the fact its a simple ereader it was exactly what i wanted,great product
5.0,just great,five stars
2.0,inferior product would not recommend even though i purchased it at 48 off i just isnt worth it the screen scrolls to five pages ahead of what your reading without the reader doing anything when trying to purchase a book the device will not register the register i have execellent wifi connection and no problem with my barnes and noble nook i set the amazon product aside and dont use it lisa quinn,very inferior product
4.0,great for daytime reading but consider the new version with the built in light it really depends on your usage we also have the new version paper white with light and it seems to be a better all around device for us i still use this with a book light but the added cost of batteries is a consideration compared to the cost of jumping up to the next version kindle works as advertised though,consider the new version with built in light
4.0,i bought this because i am a big kindle fan i have a google nexus 7 with the kindle reading app when i sit on my deck in good weather the glare of my tablet is annoying the ereader solves that problem its very light but i had to get used to its different interface should have paid closer attention to the introductory screens providing an overview of the interface but i eventually figured it out in a few hours i just wish i had reached my decision to buy this back in january 2015 when it was still on sale for 20 less than i paid for it lol,a really good budget minded ereader
4.0,it is very difficult to read the titles of books on the home page i dont like all the ads i purchased the kindle without the ads but apparently they come with it anyway i do like the nonglare screen i cant read on the kindle fire or play games on my phone because the glare hurts my eyes and i get a headache i can read this kindle all day long without getting a headache it is very lightweight and easy to hold,no headaches
5.0,my keyboard tablet died i ordered the kindle glarefree touchscreen because i didnt want a lighted screen like a tablet and this more closely resembled my old kindle i love to turn the pages with just a swipe i like the smaller size and it feels like a book i bought a light for reading at night and its great also im a prime member and amazon delivered it in two days as promised,feels just like im reading a book
5.0,this is my first kindle havent been disappointed yet only wish i would have chosen the paper white only for the light this has many fonts which is really nice because there are days my eye sight is a little worse than others love all the other things this has,my first kindle
4.0,although i wish i could buy something that actually has everything needed in one purchase eg charger cover or light it was exactly what i needed as someone who has put off getting a kindle for years i have many actual books that i will not pay to put on the kindle as well but in combination with having amazon prime its helpful getting cheaper versions of books for my monthly business book club and to try out other books prior to buying i already have laptops etc and this is just the right size and convenient for many situations,exactly right for my basic needs
5.0,i put off getting a kindle for a long time now i bougt one for my son and one for my grandson but didnt think i needed one as i have an ipad i couldnt have been more wrong this thing is wonderful the battery lasts so much longer it is smaller lighter and more portable it is better than i ever expected and i am reading more now than i have in years,got me reading again
5.0,great value,five stars
5.0,great deal,five stars
1.0,could not see screen in dim light,could not see screen in dim
2.0,i love the look of the screen i bought the device simply because i hate reading on a bright screen and books get destroyed however the interface is terrible its really ugly and not fun to use but i would say whats worse is how plagued with advertisements this thing is its shameless to turn the lock screen of my device into a billboard for your companys products perhaps i am just new to e readers but that is a practice that needs to change,advertise no matter the cost
1.0,the screen is a little too dark,dark screen
2.0,i got the device because i wanted to use the prime lending library and it only works with actual devices not apps i then found out i could only check out one book a month the device was also klunky and not exactly user friendly so it just wasnt for me,not for me
3.0,i do love my reader but there have been two things so far that i have found to dislike1 the screen doesnt just shut off after letting it sit you have to actually hold down the power button to just shut off the screen2 it doesnt auto find where you are on the book there are times where when i am at work and do not have my reader with me so i continue reading on my phones app when i go back to me reader later that night i have to search where i was manually on an ipad iphone or android the app auto finds the last page and asks you if you would like to move to that point this device does notdont get me wrong i love the reader but these two things almost made me want to return it for another better device,happy but unhappy at the same time
4.0,much smaller than i expected my fault not yours didnt realize that 6 is so small not knowing what the next size is when advertising the 6 i think it would be good for you to mention the next size so other people arent misguided,pocketbook kindle
4.0,very lite touchscreen is easier for my arthritic fingers my experience with amazon has been excellent the orders arrive quickly and if you need to return an item theres no problem the customer service reps are professional knowledgeable of items sold patient and efficient,four stars and a half
5.0,its great,five stars
5.0,i love this for outdoor reading i bought this because anything with light displays are difficult to see out in the sun but this works perfect also if the back lit screen bothers my eyes on my ipad i just switch to this i work many hours staring at a computer screen and this helps when i want to read a book who uses paper books anymore the battery life is long lasting between charges,perfect just what i needed
5.0,good stuff,five stars
5.0,exactly what i was looking for i have been using the amazon kindle app for years on other devices but i was always handicapped by the fact that either the screens were too small or i couldnt see it in brightlight this kindle takes care of both of those problems at a great price its lightweight easy to read and the battery last four weeks also having a kindle the amazon lending library is an added bonus,love it
5.0,i like it,five stars
4.0,could you please mail me more information i cant learn enough from the info i have for example how do i archive books that i have readi also want to know how to find books i havent read yet currently such a book shows up at the end and i need outside help finding the first pagei really would appreciate a mail explaining me these issuesotherwise i really enjoy the touch screen it saves time and is a vast improvement to my first kindlewarm regards,i really enjoy the touch screen
3.0,not bad for the pricebut i find the dictionary and highlighting extremely annoying and apparently it is not possible to delete them i have a fire and the dx which i think is the best of all but this is ok for travelif i had known about the features that i mentioned i would not have got this onebut will persevere for a while,some annoying features
5.0,i received the kindle 7th generation as a christmas gift and have really been enjoying it since this is my first kindle it took some learning and getting used to how it works the user guide is disappointing and not very user friendly however i am using my kindle every day and reading on it is a real pleasure downloading new books to read almost instantly on my kindle is really nice i would recommend the fintie kindle 7th gen smartshell case for security and comfort if i upgrade to another kindle in the future i think the backlit model would be useful for low light reading,nice basic kindle
5.0,i recently retired my original kindle and purchased the kindle with glarefree touchscreen display it is so much more than just a reading device i love itit did take a few days to get used to the touch screen you have to learn handsoff of the screen unless youre changing pages or need to access information my old kindle had the buttons for accessing informationbut this one is really clear and easy to use,fantastic device
4.0,nice kindle sturdy and glare free great for the kids and myself good starter kindle though i wish it had a light and more pictures in books for younger children a bit tricky to figure out at first,compact kindle
5.0,fantastic little reader its comparable in print quality to a book but easier to handle not yet used to the features but definitely a plus to have the dictionary available at the drop of a hat im enjoying reading on it so far and not noticing any straining my eyes usually having when reading illuminated screens or having to strain to wrestle with book bindings while trying not to bend a book open i will admit i love the smell of older bound books but so far only a positive experience with this reader,fantastic little reader
5.0,i bought this for my neice this last christmas originally i was going to get the kindle fire her parents however werent comfortable with her having internet access and all that comes with it like the apps social media and games so i was quite happy when i found this no it isnt the fanciest high tech thing but it does what its supposed to very well the touchscreen is very responsive and easy to navigate to where you want to go it is a great ereader where you can purchase or borrow books when a book is open the screen looks a lot like the page of a real book what was a huge seller for me and the reason for wanting to get my neice a kindle in the first place was the built in dictionary my neice can now read many books and have easy access to the definition of words she is unfamiliar with this device has increased her desire to read and her vocabulary has improved now that ive seen this being used im glad i didnt get the fire without all the distraction from apps and games she is able to focus and immerse herself into whatever story shes reading definitely recommend,definitely recommend
2.0,it is a great concept this is the first kindle i have owned but i have to reboot it every time i want to use it and it is made of chinsy material it feels like it will break in my hand the plug has already mangled the power input and ive only had the kindle for a few days less than a week i will have to return this soon because i am sure it wont last me even a year,it is a great concept this is the first kindle i have 
5.0,excellent ,new kindle
5.0,i love to read and this kindle is perfect the charge does not last as long as advertised but then i read several hours a day and the charge will last more than three days my only real whiney complaint is i cant see the art work on the covers really well because the arnt in color i love that i can make the print size bigger the anti glare screen is fab all in all this is a great product love it,you need one of these if you like to read
4.0,cool screen,four stars
5.0,love this kindle easy to use lightweight great readability i thought id never like this because i really love books but this isnt so bad after all its very light and easy to hold in one hand no glare on the screen which is really nice,pleasant surprise

5.0,i love it,five stars
4.0,fifty bucks on amazon prime day so this was an impulse purchase its a backup to my kindle voyage but a nice piece of hardware in its own right needs mechanical page turn buttons the touchscreen doesnt work well for highspeed readers otherwise serviceable and cheap,a nice starter or backup kindle
5.0,pretty good,five stars
5.0,the kindle 6 has been a handy little gadget for when i am going to college it is nice to have to read not only text books for school but also books that i download from amazon it is nice to have the glarefree touch screen easy to read with the white background,easy reading
5.0,love it,five stars
4.0,considering the price the device is great my 8 year old son needed a way to read some of the kindle books we had purchased for the older kids but he did not have a device since he sleeps with a night light anyways the lack of backlighting is not an issue plus with the parental controls he can only read with it and only the books we curate for him he loves it and it has helped him increase his reading minutes at school and home i only left it four stars because buyers should be aware the screen refresh is a little slow and it does not have backlighting,great device for children
5.0,works great,five stars
3.0,activating the insurance package for kids is extremely confusing the confirmation email from amazon should include a link since the process involves going to the page for the insurance buying it and offsetting cost with a promo code since you already paid for it in the price of the kids package,activating the insurance package for kids is extremely confusing 
5.0,excelent,five stars
5.0,i had to purchase this kindle because i broke my old keyboard kindle i am still getting used to it but it is doing what it is supposed to the best part of this and all kindle ereaders is that you can read outside but amazon still needs to offer an affordable version that is not a touchscreen my 92 year old mother has the previous version with the buttons on the side but she could never use this one,good ereader
5.0,works great,five stars
5.0,its great,five stars
1.0,i have kindle on my laptop already i dont need or want another screen to carry around what i need is kindle fire program for my laptop and tablet like i said the last thing i need is another piece of eq to pack on my wheelchair if you cant help me then ill have to contact national geographic so they can start mailing me their dead tree things and write off kindle,give me what i need not what you want me to buy
2.0,got the device quickly and it was easy to set up and usehowever it auto adjust to ambient light so not readable in low light such as on planes bedroom etc unless you turn on a light source after the xmas holidays i plan to return both devices and try a the kindle fire instead,not quite up to my expectations
3.0,vivid display but so contents small in quantity so feel like i have carpal tunnel from turning page so frequently cant be helped unless print adjusted and then i cant read it comfortably otherwise nice device, display but so contents small in quantity so feel like i have carpal tunnel from turning page so frequently
3.0,im a long time kindle owner and absolutely love mine so i decided to buy one as a gift for my mother well shame on me for not looking more closely when purchasing in the store best buy because the lack of a back light is a problem i can understand this being a budget model and using a lower resolution screen but i cant fathom why removing the back light would be an acceptable decision for an ereaderagain its my own fault for not reading more carefully i didnt have to make such a distinction when i bought mine but i would not recommend this kindle model to others,read carefully before purchasing
4.0,bought the basic kindle newest model and paid to receive it without the special values easy set upbought my first book and it downloaded quickly and i was ready within a half hour if you need the backlight feature for night reading then this isnt your model i am very happy with this model after a try with the fire series made by amazon no clutterno pesky ads,the way i want it to earn five stars it should be able to tap dance
1.0,i couldnt listen to my audiobooks,one star
4.0,i liked it but it takes a lot of geting used to it my other kindle had the books automatically transfered to the kindle and were not in the cloud i like them being in the cloud because you can read one book at a time the page turner buttons on this kindle are easier to use than on my other one but i seem to have to go to the cloud to download a book every time while with the older kindle i did not have to its easier to turn this kindle on and off as well i am still learning this kindle i am looking forward to learning more about it and just need to get a case for it,good kindle
5.0,glare free,five stars
5.0,i love my kindle i just want to read and this is perfect however do consider getting a reading light if youre not in a well lit reading area i have been having a hard time finding a good one waiting for one i ordered from amazon to arrive so we will see how that one is i dont know if the covers that come with a built in reading light are the best option for i did not get one so you may want to consider this alsohands down awesome light long battery life fits easily in my purse ,i love my kindle
5.0,easy to use,five stars
4.0,i love the fact that i can once again read my kindle in my hand rather than on my pc not a big fan of reading on the computeri dont know how i survived the internet probably all the bells and whistles and colors and info anyway this is my second kindle since i broke the first one i had by kneeing it to death while it was under the covers anyway i like my first one better i dont particularly like touching the screen to go from page to page i liked the page turner on the hardware side of the kindle instead i dont really like the ability to put in a page number instead of hunting from page to page i should be awing and ooohing at this technology but i think it might have something to do with stopping to put in the page number which to me is a bit of a delay in this age of instant gratification its still a great piece of technology and one day in the future all books and textbooks will be read on a kindle which will save the trees,still saves the trees
5.0,good device,kindle
5.0,ive had my kindle for a couple of days now and it has seen very heavy usage but barely sipped at the batteries i keep it in airplane mode for security and to preserve battery life though im still finding my way around the more advanced and difficult aspects of using the kindle using it for its basic functionality is very intuitive im impressed by the eink screen with glare equivalent to a glossy magazine page its very readable in all light conditionsits light weight and small size and the lack of need to hold the pages open have made reading in bed much more comfortable than with conventional books this is a big deal coming from a paper book purist repetitive strain injuries have made reading a painful chore not any more between this and the many free kindle books both new and classic ive been able to get back to reading as a hobby despite a low budgeti find the special offers unintrusive similar to ads in a magazine so for the cost conscious its not so bad to get the special offers edition,repetitive strain injury made reading a painful chore not anymore
5.0,i love it,five stars
4.0,i bought this for one purpose only and it is fulfilling that need quite nicely i wish a paper manual had come with the device as it would have saved me some lowgrade hassles while i was out of town im sure if i took the time to learn some of the features i would no doubt be delighted but my learning curve is very steep and it doing what i need it to do right now without those features so maybe another day ill venture further,does what i got it for
5.0,works great,five stars
5.0,i had wanted one of these for a long time but just never found one that was this size the size is great so i can fit it in my purse like i have done with my paperbacks i always carry a book with me for any appointment as i am an avid reader and have already downloaded 3 books so am excited about getting new books at a reasonable price have already almost finished one of the books and the print is very clear and their is no glare on the screen,love it
5.0,great deal,five stars
5.0,i purchased this within the past four months for myself mainly to borrow ebooks from my local public library i was hesitant to try an ereader because i much prefer physical books however i am very glad i made the decision i did i read much faster on my kindle than i do paper books i am able to rent textbooks at a much lower cost being a poor college kid is a struggle i can even email myself pdf files of required readings from class to save myself from printing them all it is very easy to sort all the pdfs into different collections for each coursei have two critiques one is that collections cannot be made within collections but i acknowledge that this is my overorganized brain seeking unreasonable requests the other is that highlighting in pdfs is difficult however highlighting in a normal ebook is incredibly easy even if the section i want to highlight runs over two pagesthis is a very basic ereader without many bells and whistles and it suits me just fine reading outside is not an issue and reading under the covers with a flashlight poses no problem i charge my kindle once every two weeks with my frequent use but it can go longer between charges i would recommend this ereader to anyone new to the ebook game,very pleased
5.0,wow what an amazing find at an awesome price i should have gotten one of these awhile ago i never wanted to make the jump from a tangible paperback book but the kindle is perfect and i can go through the pages must faster perfect starter kindle for anyone on a budget the background doesnt light up but i didnt expect it to from reading previous reviews if you love to read i say go for it,what an amazing find at an awesome price
4.0,high quality,what you expect
5.0,she loves it,great product
5.0,i finally got an ereader after considering it a few years and i must say its more than id hoped for the text is dark and clear the kindle itself is light and easy to carry around and by far the best feature is one that isnt even advertised there are no pages to close on you when you set it somewhere to read after years of reading in odd positions and using anything nearby to weight down the pages being able to just set the kindle down and keep reading is possibly the greatest change possible the future is finally here and my book doesnt try to close itself every time i shift aroundi was a little worried about its pdf reading ability after doing extensive research but after loading up a few from my computer i can say its much easier to read them than on my computer screen just set it to landscape mode and youre set to go which is a godsend since ive amassed more pdfs of programming books and other texts over the years than any human should and sitting at a desk trying to read them has always led me to stop just a few dozen pages in never to returnoverall its a great product and i look forward to using it daily,makes reading even easier
4.0,easy to use,four stars
5.0,seriously how did i live without a kindle for so long kindle apps are all well and good but it just isnt the same it isnt as cute as some of the animated options out there but i didnt realize how much eye strain there was from reading with a backlit screen until i switched from the app to using a kindle with eink and the battery lasts forever,kindle apps are all well and good but it just isnt the same
5.0,it is great,buy now
5.0,i now have to apologize to everyone who kept telling me how awesome this device is i was a major naysayer an english prof who absolutely would never ever utilize this format insisted i needed the tactile sensation that holding a book gives me i was wrong love this received it for mothers day,i am a convert lol
5.0,good product,five stars
3.0,its nice but i am yet to figure out how to increase the font size permanently in settings i am farsighted so i need large fonts nevertheless despite this issue the devide is quite portable i was able to download some of my books from the cloud i wish it had audio capability and be linked to audiobooks so i could listen to some of my audiobooks while commuting it is linked with goodreads though,nice portable device for reading no audio
4.0,works great,four stars
2.0,a great device at a great price feels better made than earlier versions but now a year later its already having problems freezes frequently and i have to restart it i think these kindles are for people who dont read very often i read every day and this kindle has been acting up for a couple months i love my kindle but i cant justify buying a new one every year i hope they improve the quality of the kindle maybe someday ill try one again but ive had 3 that didnt last a year,a year later no more five stars
1.0,instructions are impossible to understand eg this one if you want to read or shop on your kindle while continuing to charge over usb please keep the usb cable attached but eject your kindle from your computer this looks like an english sentence but what can it possibly mean to keep the usb cable attached to what if not the computer but eject the kindle from the computer and this isnt the only one so i tried to get help online but the person either couldnt understand my simple questions or didnt have answers but wouldnt say so eg why is the power adapter needed when the usb cable that comes with the kindle seems to work fine in 5 or 6 exchanges i got no answer except its specially designed for kindle,cant use my kindle because instructions dont make sense
5.0,as a companion to my ipad this little gem is about the size of a large paperback book and much lighter i find i am reading kindle books on this handy device more than i am my heavier ipad long lasting battery life portability ease of reading the screen all add up to a pleasant little reader to use wherever you like to read i am pleased with my purchase,hold a hundred books in one hand
1.0,over priced compared to other kindle,one star
4.0,this is fine for just reading books i do get a slight glare with my attached ikross clip on light when i have the light aimed straight at the screen but tilting the screen and adjusting light helps i havent tried this outside in sunlight yet i had a kindle fire before and the backlight gave me headaches with extended reading which is why i bought this one works great for just reading,kindle 6 glarefree touchscreen display
3.0,not as easy to use as i was hoping,three stars
5.0,my husband and i bought this kindle for our 10 year old christmas is taking too long to come d we cant wait until he gets this i love the size of this new kindle just perfect for those little hands its so easy to set up i would recommend this bundle to anyone who wants to buy something for their child to read it doesnt get any better i love the dictionary feature great for learning new words,a great deal for your children
3.0,love it but cant read in dark 😄,three stars
4.0,an excellent device that even skeptics will grow to love i love the smell and feel of real books but when i was on vacation i spent a week with no internet connection nor cell phone signal and had to rely on my books to keep me company during this stay i had luckily preemptively downloaded a bunch of books to the device and i plowed straight through 4 or 5 of them this would not have been possible if i had to carry 4 or 5 books on every tripas for the specifications on the device i recommend splurging a bit to get the paperwhite particularly if you like reading at dusk or while traveling this version is pleasant while theres adequate light but if there is inconsistent light say from reading while on a train you will become frustrated the paperwhite with a backlight is much better in this regard in addition i do wish that it was a little bit larger as i have to either hold it with two hands or between my palm and my abductor pollucis meat of the thumb to balance it more nonscreen space for leverage is welcome and would make reading upside down or at angles easiermy last quip about this device is that the exterior scratches fairly easily i left my kindle in my backpack while traveling but it suffered no huge distress and has little scratches that can be distracting from the page definitely recommend purchasing with a cover of some sortthe positivesi love the screen it really does feel like paper and theres about as much readable area as a normal book customizable fonts are nice the area allocated to touch is nice sensitivity is adequate if a bit too much and overall does its job wellthe data transfer system is excellent as i can download books either from amazon or through a third party service and put them on the device via usb easily the experimental browser and goodreads are nice bonuses that i dont really use but you could its very easy to share books with friendsfamily as wellits very light and pleasant to carry around no matter how heavy the reading youre doing isgreat volume lets you read as many books as you want and you can set up a buffet of reading for whatever youre in the mood for rather than being limited by what you have with youoverall recommended but consider the other models first to best match your needs,an excellent device that even skeptics will grow to love
5.0,had to replace the 6 year old kindle we had really like this touch screen model screen is the same size but overall its a bit small and a lot lighter great job only problem is the games that were on the old one wont work on the touch screen they game people have on touch screen version,really nice love the touch screen very light
3.0,there does not seem to be a clear logical simple way to get to home base so to speak from wherever you find your self to me it would incredibly easy to transition from buttons only to at least 2 buttons power and home the desire to allow every book or document to be included in any and every collection precludes simply to leave whatever one is doing and just get home and then restart from it i strongly recommend it for a couple of years at least that would be my biggest issue to give this product a better score,it would incredibly easy to transition from buttons only to at least 2 
1.0,this device did not meet my expectations at all very dissapointed i wanted it to read my college textbooks and none were compatible with this device i bought it for nothing because i find no use to it now not what i was expecting it did not help me at all,this device did not meet my expectations at all 
5.0,great kindle for reading i have a kindle 89 fire hdx that i use for a lot of things but i needed something for reading exclusively this kindle does the job the books are very clear to read turning pages is simple the battery life seems to be very good i can go weeks without having to charge it while reading about thirty minutes a day overall an outstanding product,great kindle
5.0,always great,five stars
5.0,i bought this for my elevenyearold brother who is a voracious reader its been three days and hes already finished three young adult novels coupled with a kindle unlimited subscription he has access to hundreds of thousands of books including comics when he goes back to school ill help him get his school textbooks and required readings uploaded onto his kindle the interface is a little confusing at first and the advertisements are really meh but as a whole im really glad with my purchase ,love it already
4.0,good product,four stars
3.0,this is a nice little reading device its held up well for the past few months of travelwhat i dont like is that the black plastic scratches and streaks easily its kind of distracting when youre reading a book to see streaks in the black plastic finish wish i could have gotten this in a different color,good ereader with some quality issues
5.0,good quality,five stars
4.0,i preferred the listing of books to be in text the screen is not easily managed with the thumbnail images with practice however i will become more comfortable with using it one of the problems with my old kindle is the glare the touchscreen display on the new one is glarefree so that is a plus,glarefree is a plus factor
4.0,excelent ,four stars
5.0,this was exactly what i was looking for my husband bought me the kindle fire to replace my kindle 2 that had gotten wet but i just wanted a reader so i wouldnt have the distraction of internet apps and email i have an ipad and surface pro 2 for that now i can read without all of the other noise very happy,very happy
5.0,sanks a lot,five stars
5.0,i purchased the kindle 6 glarefree touchscreen display as a kit for my 7year old granddaughter who loves to read it came with a 2year warranty by squaretrade this was a super investment in my grand kids education and future,kindle 6 glarefree touchscreen display
5.0,it is super,five stars
5.0,i have not used it much at this point so i dont really know what it does and doesnt but it is superb in what i have used it forreading my favorite books it is easy to use i can read the words without any trouble it is clearly marked as to what you are doing i am just really pleased with it and would recommend it to others,recommended
5.0,excellent ,five stars
4.0,i bought this to replace my trusty old original kindle dx with the keyboard after the 5way button on the dx suddenly broke i was a little worried about how tiny the screen is and on day 2 i am finding it annoying to have to page turn so frequently but i think eventually it will become second nature and the touch screen will be better than the klunkiness of all those buttons  although after years with the dx the only time the buttons annoyed me was when typing in a search term or when i forgot i wasnt on my ipad and tried to scroll with my finger i opted for the plain old kindle vs moving up to a paperwhite or voyage because i stare at a computer monitor at work all day and usually spend an hour or two in the evening on the ipad so i really didnt want another lighted screen i use the kindle almost exclusively to read in bed where i have a lamp on the wall that shines over my shoulder i am quite satisfied with the clarity of the text which is noticeably darker than the dx so i am glad i didnt opt for the more expensive models simply for higher resolution especially since i read a lot of complaints that the lighting in those models is not even which would drive me nuts im not entirely sure i made the right choice getting the special offers version i misread the description and thought the offers would only be on the sleep screen not on the home screen too one thing i will not miss about the kindle dx is the bruises on the bridge of my nose from it bonking me when i fell asleep reading i think the smaller lighter kindle will be easier on my face,i am finding it annoying to have to page turn so frequently
5.0,will cherish,five stars
4.0,i think any negatives that i am feeling now are just because i am not used to this on i had the one with buttons before and still have to learn about navigating it has all the options but i am not used to having to take the extra steps over all i am enjoying my new kindle with touchscreen and would feel comfortable recommending it to anyone looking for just a reader,good choice for a reader
5.0,this is my third kindle i love all three my first one was the 2nd gen when the fire came out i had to have one i gave my first one away i love my fire i keep that one next to my bed so that i can read at night i bought the 3rd one because i was going on vacation to the beach and wanted to be able to read i also enjoy reading on my back deck the fire is not for using in the sun because of the glare now that vacation is over the 6 is perfect for carrying around in my purse for reading emergencies people need to fully read product descriptions before they buy stuff it does not come with a light ive had with buttons and without both work great kindle products are awesome,i love all three
5.0,i love books and have been resistant to reading on a kindle i borrowed my husbands kindle to start and then got one of my own now i love reading on a kindle i still prefer the feel of a real book however this kindle has a lot of cool features the pages look like regular book pages you can read outside its very easy to turn the page with just a quick little tap its easy to bookmark your page and then scroll back to reread something amazons advertising of this was completely true it does everything as promised and i am very happy with it,satisfied customer
5.0,love my kindles all of them each one beloved each newest improved but love and use every single one good for young or old i have become dependent on the light weight the simple to use font and size of print settings this one is so light weight the turning of pages so much simpler not that it was so hard on the previous one nothing to dislike everything to love,love my kindles
5.0,as advertised,as advertised
5.0,i cant say enough good things about this i have dropped mine several times my kids borrow it and abuse it and it works and looks like new i have owned several of the other brands and paid hundreds of dollars for the color tablet kinds at that other book store only to find they are heavy and unpleasant to read on i prefer reading on this to any other of the several i own,i cant say enough good things about this
2.0,needs a light,two stars
5.0,there isnt much new to say about a kindle reader than it hasnt already been said i cant recommend enough owing a kindle and try for yourself if it is for you some people say that they still prefer reading on paper books its hard to argue with them but if you are not one of those persons you will find the kindle reader to be one of your best tech products,one of my favourites tech products
5.0,like espected,five stars
5.0,love kindle s these are christmas gifts for our grandkids who love to read they were big winners for this years christmas i was very happy that amazon adjusted my bill when they went on sale a few days after i had received them amazons support are greatthanks amazon,1 xmas gift for our grandkids this year
5.0,just perfect,five stars
5.0,i got this as a gift from my grandfather so far i am in love with this the only thing i wish it had was an option for a back light when reading at night i cant read on the new style e readers so this works very well for me,so far i am in love with this
4.0,easy to read,four stars
5.0,this little digital reader is perfect for those of use who get eye strain and headaches after reading books on phones tablets or computers the size is perfect to hold in one hand during long reading sessions and the font options are great i use a smaller font but can enlarge it for books my children read book downloads are quick and so simple im sure i could hand this little device off to my nontechnical friends and family members without a glitch if you just want a straight forward ereader without bells and whistles this kindle is for you,perfect for an avid reader
5.0,great product,five stars
2.0,yes i knew this was not lighted like the paperwhite but i did not expect it to be so dark others have likened it to reading a paperback and having to do so in a lit room but i can guarantee that the pages of a paperback are much whiter and brighter than this old yellow thing i dont really understand why kindleamazon have this item still available and havent at least upgraded the background to a brighter image i almost feel like im being punished for not wanting to spend twice as much for a light it is apparent that the glarefree screen is necessary because the reader must be held up to bright light just to be readable not a fanwondering how much it will cost me to return a product that probably shouldnt even be on the market,unlit reader with dim yellowed pages why arent the pages whiter it is new7th gensurely they can update the background
4.0,its all good,four stars
4.0,the jury is still out for me on this one the touch screen is very touchy and often does things you dont want also mine has been freezing up a lota problem i didnt have with my old kindle i dont know that i would purchase this again but since i did i will use it my older kindle was much more user friendly updating my reviewthe jury is in i still have this but use it very little i have huge problems finding my downloads and hate hate hate hate the blasted touch screen the set up of the older models was far better you could find your books and swiping the screen didnt send you into something you were into before you swiped it mine is still freezing up will not buy another kindle until something is available other than this touch screen format if it worked well that would be one thing but it doesnt,i hardly use this it is a poor product imo
5.0,great product,five stars
4.0,though i wish i had bought the paperwhite so that i didnt need an external light source i have nonetheless enjoyed having an ereader travel will be so much easier now that i dont need to carry actual books with me it seems to have all the features i would want in an ereader and i have yet to need to charge it i still dont understand why amazon doesnt include the charger with any kindle but other than that im satisfied,i cant put it down
1.0,i cant figure out how to make the screen brighter so i can see it at night very disappointed in its performancecertainly poorer than my other onealso ch time i turn it on i have to wait for it to load which is annoying thinking of bringing it back from where i purchased it,very disappointed in its performance
2.0,it doesnt have as many features as my old one same model purchased in 2012no games can be downloaded informed by customer service must upgrade to a kindle fire for that but already have a tablet only feature worthwhile is the battery life a real disappointment couldnt return it one day after receivedone way to move out their inventory with no recourse,a real disappointment couldnt return it one day after received

2.0,i bought the lds scriptures old and new testaments and the book of mormon however i havent been able to figure out how to go to chapter and verse that i want to refer to so ive just put it aside hoping someone can show me what to do to bring up chapter and verse to study a particular topic there dont seem to be any instructions to help with this with my physical scriptures i can look up something in the topical guide and then go to all the scriptures covering that subject the kindle seems to be useless if theres no way to do thatbeverly portlock,how to use scriptures
1.0,plan to return it was not what i expected,ver sad
1.0,wth have you done with this upgrade so complicated i cant find the slide bar to increase the brightness very unhappy,new upgrade sucks
5.0,one of the best thing ive boughtever,five stars
5.0,i gave this to my favorite aunt for christmas at 89 she reads her bible daily from her kindle now she loves it and i am so glad to find yet another gift that she appreciates and can use keep this in mind for your elderly loved one help them set it up and have them enjoy modern technology and the convenience of thousands of titles to chose from right from their easy chair,the perfect gift for my 89 year old aunt
5.0,as the owner of an original kindle model 1 i am very pleased with this productpros its fast real fast it took me a few days to get use to how quick it was changing pages due to the v1cons the touch screen can be very sensitive a twitch of your finger when turning pages may cause the device to change two pages instead of just one not a huge deal and not worth removing even a 14 of a stari highly suggest this kindle for anybody who wants an ereader,fantastic product
5.0,i have multiple kindlesand i love them all i bought this specifically for outside reading and it delivers crisp script no reflection or glare it perfect just like ready a paper book easy to useits just what the reading dr ordered,glare be gone
5.0,we have been giving these to our kids as their reading improves they love having so many books so accessible eventually we will have all 5 kiddos using their own right now we only have 3 readers so we will still be repeat customers on the kindle,great reading tool wonderful for kids
5.0,i am so amazed at the clairity of this display and how easy it is to work the charger is not needed because my phone charger works with it just fine so i am glad i did not invest in the extra chargerit arrived in wonderful condition and in good time,i am so amazed at the clairity of this display and how easy 
5.0,i really like the size of the kindle the backlight is subtle and does not hurt the eyes i carry it around in my purse and can use it in quite a few areas it is amazing how compact and convenient the kindle touchscreen is dcb,compact and convenient kindle
5.0,i was lucky enough to get this new kindle 2014 edition when it was on sale for49 i love this kindle even though it doesnt have a light built in its really lightweight i think its even more light than my cell phone samsung galaxy s5 i have no complaints about it i am pleased with the touch screen technology this is replacing my kindle keyboard which no longer keeps a charge in the battery,love it
5.0,works great so far so good i like that it looks good underneath a lamp or lighting at night and there really is no glare i was a bit skeptical at first but it seems perfect its very similar to reading an actual printed book which is what i wanted so its good,its good and i like itso there it is
4.0,simple straight forward way to read the only thing lacking is adjustable screen lighting the kindle reminds me of a basic car from the 60s it got you where you wanted to go and got 25 mpg it didnt need a computer on the engine to tell you it wasnt running properly nor did you have to spend 800 for a slight bumper bump,no need for bells and whistles
5.0,i bought a kindle so i could read several library books that i can only get as an ebook i love this the only bad thing is that it doesnt have a light so no nighttime reading before bed unless i keep the overhead light on,i love this the only bad thing is that it 
5.0,very convenient,five stars
1.0,please dont purchase this there is no screen brightness adjustment there is no backlight the screen is dark and you need a light to read it,please dont purchase this there is no screen brightness 
1.0,nothing like my old onenot worth the money,one star
1.0,for the first time im without words regarding amazons customer service ive owned at least 5 kindle devices my fire works great but when i want to read the glare resistant models are much better when my kindle touch displayed a message that it was in need of repair i called customer service after all of the recommended maneuvers online charging restarting etc it was a total waste of time the recommendation was to buy a new kindle no repair not even an exchange program its broke throw it away had the error message just said that id have about 2 more hours of life back,my fire works great but when i want to read
5.0,great product,five stars
4.0,its very good,four stars
5.0,i have the very first kindle and im going to keep it but i did want something that had a touch screen for anyone who likes to read outside this is what you want i have an ipad that i love but take it outside or any where there is glare and it is literally worthless this is also small and lightweight its for readers like myself who go through a ton of books again though the biggest benefit is no glare you can sit in full sun and i live in phoenix and you can read just fine at night i also use it in bed but you do need to have a light on but personally i tried reading on devices that were backlit and they make me go bug eyed my eyes just get exhausted trying to read off ipads or other devices that have the little tv screens this simple basic affordable kindle is just right for those readers out there who just want to sit back and read and not get cramps in your hands because of the weight or headaches because of the screen hands down best reader out there,i have an ipad that i love but take it outside
5.0,so far so good,good for the price
3.0,i like the size of it it has been very easy signing in and getting books but i have not been able to get audio books to work i have tried connecting head phones i have downloaded books to my computer and ipad and still can not get the audio portion to work any advice would be greatly appreciated,need audio to work
5.0,my best friend,five stars
5.0,perfect but i do with amazon would come out with a reader that combines the light up screen and the way this turns the pages love being able to click on the side rather than having to swipe the page bought this as a gift i already own one,love it
5.0,great useful,i like it thank you
4.0,i bought this to replace my 3g version that wore out from all my reading i like the compact size and it reads well in sunlight the only thing i miss is buttons to move pages since it is not always convenient to swipe the screen still i enjoy this kindle as much as any i own,good reader
5.0,great product,five stars
5.0,this is personally my fourth kindle but within my family weve had 8 i love this one because of its sizeits nice and small so i can pop it in my purse i had the original kindle and used it until it broke then i got a kindle fire for christmas i loved the firebut i also have an ipad and an iphone so i got this one just for reading its a lot less bulky,love it
4.0,purchased this for my daughters use as i can get so many more free books for her to read via kindle vs her nook and can share my books to her device because shes only 12 so i keep it on my account shes a voracious reader loving it so far all the functionality she wants and the versatility i was looking for,great device for simply reading
4.0,i bought this after reading a prep article i have had it less than a month but have managed to shift all 120 kindle reads most of them free i still have to move some others but its no where near full it works like a book just like advertised if you dont have light you dont read battery is still going good though i read only 12 2 hours a day on it sure beats using my phone or tablet all the time for the 50 1495 for the 110 v adapters still have less in than normally would cost since it runs off of the same voltage as my phone all my power storage setups work with it including my solar set up sure cant complain so far,best deal for my need storage reading of lots of how to books
3.0,the screen is too small so unless you read at a childs pace be prepared to constantly flip pages it doesnt have a backlight so cant be read in dim light available in other readers i read when i go to sleep or on the plane both occasions where i dont use lights it doesnt support epub the most common format of ebooks floating in the virtual libraries pro good battery life and price,good battery life and price

5.0,great reader these were gifted to my children ages 1011 and are quite user friendly my two favorite features are the kindle free time and the vocabulary builder we home educate and these two features are a great way for me to keep an eye on their free time reading time aside from assigned reading and how their vocabulary is growing if they are reading challenging enough books already an indispensable tool for our home school thank you kindle for a wonderful product,a great home education tool

5.0,this is my second 6 kindle my husband recently had a stroke and is now having visual problems the font size feature on the kindle allows him the ability to actually read again thank you so much,great therapeutic aid for low vision readers
5.0,this is my 2nd kindle the 1st i regifted when i received my ipad but then i found that i needed another one as i simply cannot read any of the tablets we own outside its perfect size for my hand as well as for my purse or whatever bag tote i am carrying,yes if youre a tablet owner you still need a kindle
5.0,this is a great reading device after working all day on a computer i love to come home in the evening and read for a while but reading from another back lit device at the end of a long day takes a toll on my eyes this kindle eliminates that problem so that i like to read for longer periods of time now just like reading a real book,great reading device
3.0,i am a senior citizen and i like the old keyboard kindle better this one is not good for people with shaky hands because of the touch screen also i have trouble with this one locking up and have to reboot it which i hardly ever had that trouble with the old one,like the old version better
5.0,i love books i have always loved books when the ereader craze started i was horrified i would never give up my precious bookswith their sound their smell their magic but then i married a man whos job allowed him to travel i realized touring my entire library across the country would be completely ridiculous so i bought a kindle i bought it solely for the sake of portability with the expectation of hating it for its coldness the coldness of technology i was wrong it reads wonderfully the pages turn seamlessly i forget sometimes while im reading that it isnt a book it is the perfect size and weight and without a backlight it reads just like paper there is no screen glare with the exception of a particular angle in direct sunlight which is easy enough to avoid while i do believe i may just be falling in love with this little electronic device i am certainly not turning my back on real books i bought one just the other day in fact however if you are the type to carry a book with you this is by far a game changer you can have as many books as you like all in one place,happily surprised
5.0,this is awesome its not one of the ones you can use for games which i liked i use it all the time and rarely have to charge it because the battery life is amazing i would recommend to anybody that wants one just for books,
3.0,i have had an old kindle touch for sometime now so a new one was i order i like this one but have a few things i would changethey took away the home screen button from the front of the device i really miss thati wish i didnt have to jump through so many hoops to turn off wifi there used to be an option for this in the menu but now you have to go through several steps to put it in airplane mode just a small annoyanceit feels cheap my old one had a coating on the back that made it nonslip and the edges were rounded which made it more comfortable to hold this one is just slippery plastic and i dont like the beveled edges its like they are making it so you have to buy a case for ittwo annoying things that are true of all kindle devices and apps are true of this onethere is no way to stop items automatically downloading to the devicesapps i buy a lot of free books and dont necessarily want them all downloaded automatically that makes for a lot of items to wade throughi wish there was a way to delete multiple items at once so when the above unwanted download occurs i can quickly delete what i dont wantother than those things this kindle is faster and the battery is better i hope they improve on the next oneupdate 51915 i am also now realizing that none of my kindle active content will work on this kindle and apparently has not worked on any kindle since the original kindle touch that is frustrating i really enjoyed my active content,eh
4.0,it is a usable device but requires extra lighting the grayscale background is very dark and unhelpful in certain lights it is difficult to scroll through the books and find something particular because the true cover of the book isnt shown you have to read all the titles on the page to find the one you want the search function is fine if you remember the correct title or the authors name but is confusing in the icons along the side of books and relatively useless at guessing what you want if you omit one letter from a title but it works holds my books allows downloads anywhere there is wifi,the search function is fine if you remember the correct title or the authors 
4.0,this is a great ereader i upgraded from the very first kindle which still works perfectly just wanted something a little easier to use instead of using the buttons to choose everything i do wish i would have gotten the backlit screen but my led light works perfect i read constantly and before the kindle i had tons of books everywhere love that i can now keep them all at my fingertips in one small device i also recently took this to florida and read on the beach with no glare at all like i said the only drawback is that it doesnt have a lit screen i feel like this should now just be a constant on all ereaders instead of having to pay extra for it,this is a great ereader i upgraded from the very first kindle
5.0,love it bought one for myself and two more for my family i really love that it has no backlight so i have to use it with light just like a book it doesnt hurt my eyes that waythanks kindle,love it

5.0,awesomely cool,five stars
5.0,very satisified,five stars
1.0,bottom of the line reader doesnt even light up,one star
1.0,its a good thing this is advertised as having no glare in bright sunlight because you will need bright sunlight to see the screen it is impossible to read in a dim room or on a dim plane or any other dim place where youd like to enjoy the convenience of an ereader forget reading in bed while your spouse sleeps unless you want to buy a batteryeating clipon light the screen isnt even bright enough to read in a room with the lights down somewhat low youll need a reading lamp i saw the comments about no light but for some reason i thought it would have a basic brightness control setting in the menu like the kindle app on my phone which also doesnt have a physical light nope no light means no back lit screen no brightness controli enjoy using the kindle app on my phone when i travel or wait in an office somewhere thought id treat myself to a real kindle with a bigger screen unfortunately this basic model isnt usable in most situations where i would like to use it,its a good thing this is advertised as having no glare in

4.0,i was worried with this being a lower end device that it would be lacking in quality and features it is not as long as youre in light suitable for reading a paper book you will have no issues reading the text on this kindle load it up with books from a wifi connection charge it and youre literally set for weeksdont fret over saving the money and opting to receive special offers theyre unobtrusive and youll rarely notice them,i was worried with this being a lower end device 
5.0,i love that i can take my entire library hundreds of books with me anywhere i go and it weighs less than a paperback book the only thing i dont care for is the black and white when i am looking for a particular book cover it is difficult for me to tell them apart but my eyes are a lot older these days,i love my kindle
5.0,i like this little reader so much im getting another one for my daughter now i dont do anything but read on this but it downloads a book in about 7 seconds i love that i can increase the font size i also like the touch page turn i have read some people dont like the way it feels i have no problem with that its light and easy to hold or put on a pillow on my lap and read i dont need a light and find no reason to pay for a light,i like this little reader so much im getting another one 
5.0,bought this a while back when it was prime day and its honestly one of the best purchases ive madeit just so happens that i have a huge bookkeeping problem and have legitimately run out of space to store physical books so the day i bought this i switched to digital and that is no longer a problemthis kindle is exactly as advertised and im always so surprised that it lasts for weeks without needing to be charged i knew that this one did not come in with a builtin light so no complaints there its also lightweight and does not get uncomfortable to hold over an extended period of timeive had no problems with it whatsoever so far and its a good reader to start with my first one im surprised i didnt think this was a good investment back when i was a freshman in college because it wouldve made my life so much easier i use it now for textbooks at leastif you dont need a builtin light or extra features not advertised id definitely go for this one its held up pretty well,when it was prime day and its honestly one of the best purchases ive made
4.0,i gave this 4 stars because sometimes when i touch to turn the page it will advance several pages making me back track one page at a time to search for where i left off otherwise im really enjoying itupdating review change from 4 stars to 1 received on may 15 2015 used an hour or so per day on july 6 2015 the device froze up the only thing i am able to read are the ads amazon so kindly provides i have contacted amazon and am informed that they cannot do an exchange but that it is under warranty whatever that means i will update this review when i learn just what amazon will do to back up their productupdating review the response to the above problem was swift and fixed i was very pleased with the help and the device is now up and running so im changing this back to 4 stars,quick response to frozen kindle
5.0,i love the kindle touch screen it is so easy to use and it is also very easy to download ebooks from my public library as well as amazon all down loaded through wifi my family owns three of these and because they are all linked to one account we can share books off of the cloudgoing on a two week vacation my wife and i used to take a suitcase full of books now we just take 2 kindles,a library in your hand
1.0,i enjoyed this product for 13 months until the bottom half of the screen went black for no clear reason amazon wouldnt refund because i was passed the 1year warranty mark by just a few weeks i called and lobbied them for a replacement or at least a discount on a replacement and i got nothing bad product horrible customer service,bad product horrible customer service
5.0,with some trepidation last christmas i gave this kindle to my dad who is 93 at first he had some trouble with it but now he absolutely loves it since it is on my account i get his books i am able to get a lot of library books online for him its great some of his books are free of course i buy him some too i believe his kindle has added to the quality of his life and i know what to get him this christmas an amazon gift card,its great some of his books are free
5.0,awesome love it,five stars
5.0,its a great item for reading and it does well in the bright light it doesnt have a back light which the description explains to you its everything i need and the price was good it was on a great sale on black friday in july,its a great item for reading and it does well in the 
5.0,i love the kindle,five stars
1.0,kindles have been a part of our lives since the first generation kindle reader my son and i are on our 6th kindle boy was i a loyal fan im a librarian and it changed the way we read books and lightened our load when we traveled i probably sold hundreds to friends and family in those first five years just through my vocal enthusiasm for the device i loved showing people how it worked in addition customer service would replace our broken kindles regularly for a small price and we could read and buy books weekly if not sometimes daily fast forward ten years and i am so frustrated with kindles and amazoncom i quit amazon prime this year i dislike the kindle touch reader because any slight touch to the screen gets me completely lost even my son who never complains about anything complains about this kindle and i detest the kindle fire because it stopped holding a charge after 12 months so watching a movie is just a pain i dislike reading books on the fire the light bothers me weve rented dozens of movies and lost at least half of them to that silly 24 hour expiration after you start im sorry but i cant stay awake at night to watch a whole film it sometimes takes awhile and i need that option dont get me started on customer service what used to be wonderful is now awful and time consuming not worth the hassle ive become quite soured on the whole business model plus it doesnt help that the employees of amazon work in harsh conditions with low pay ive listened to a few programs on the radio and on television i think one was 60 minutes and the founder jeff bezos has come under some very harsh criticisms by book sellers publishers and other small businesses competitors as well the reviews on him are not complimentary my two cents think through your purchases estimate how much money youre going to spend in a year on amazon products and if the amazon prime membership is worthwhile figure out how many hours of enjoyment you will get in return for that investment is truly worth your money ive thought it through and for me the answer is clearly no ive been 8 months clean now and im happy with my decision ive chosen to buy less and pay outright for each individual item i deem important enough to own or rent and i still get consistently duped on those movie rentals i dont mind waiting a few extra days for an item to ship either it turns out im still frustrated but at least i have a few more hundred dollars to spend elsewhere now,i wish for the good old days

5.0,excellent service,five stars
4.0,very good ebook ,four stars
1.0,my main criticism is that content availability varies depending on which county you go to i have a new zealand credit card but live in indonesia and work in timorleste but every time i move around the ability to access content changes even though my credit card stays the same the content for magazines and newspapers is also rather limited would not buy again because of this disappointment,content availability disappointing
1.0,i am sure that this is a great product but it did not have the very thing i needed i was looking for a kindle that had texttospeech this one does not have that,no texttospeech
5.0,this kindle is a huge improvement over my earlier version with all the buttons its nice having a touch screen and the font is easier to read i would have liked to try the paper white model but got a really good deal on this during prime day,very nice
5.0,i received a kindle for christmas and i absolutely love it i am also an ipad owner but i prefer the kindle for reading as the electronic ink is much easier on my eyes the back lighting is pretty decent and very useful for compensating for lower light conditions i was concerned that it would kill the battery life quickly but it seems to be good i only charge it about every two weeks,love it
5.0,this basic kindle totally met all my expectations i have a kindlefire which i love but when im reading on it its a tad heavy to hold for extended reading times i wanted a kindle that was light and was not backlit so that i can read it comfortably in bright daylight without having to turn the screen brightness to the max as i have to do with the kindlefire,totally met all my expectations
4.0,pros easy to read dictionary words look up translator notes 10mo for unlimited bookslike 700k out 3 million amazon prime 1 free book a month battery life pricecons no audio capability anymore still pretty slow books are pretty expensive the interface could be a lot better and easier to use though its pretty easy but annoying no button for next page as an option screen blinking whenever clicking a commandim on the fence on returning it because of cons though price is reasonable,pros with clear cons
5.0,i have an older kindler ereader that wasnt syncing so needed to upgrade id had it for about 5 years the new ereader is easy to use i love the nonglare feature i hate having to move my tablet as i read to eliminate the glare whether im inside or outside if youre an avid reader this feature is for you i was hesitate to go from a 3g to wifi but it hasnt been a problem lots of free wifi areas the size and weight are nice it fits easily in my handbag i dont get tired of holding it as i read,nonglare feature is my favorite
1.0,i was a firm supporter of kindle but after this one broke down out of the blue and amazon did not offer any type of discount to replace it my warranty expired i was deeply disappointed in both kindle and amazon i will not be purchasing a kindle after this and will certainly note recommend this device to anyone,bad quality awful service
1.0,perhaps i was too hasty in my purchase but why would this model not have a backlight does any readertablet not have a backlight it is a standard featurein addition the screen not turning off for a long time needing to hold down the one button forever not impressed at all,no backlight screen turnoff time unadjustable
5.0,love it i like it way better than i assumed i would there was a great sale around christmas so i took a chance i read more and buy more books than i used to if im running errands i pop it in my purse and read if i have to wait in a long line love it ive also used it to store read pdf files,love it i like it way better than i 
3.0,without having ads would have had one more star from me,three stars
4.0,pretty nice once you get used to it i sort of wish there was some way i could fit it in to my shirt pocket to take with me for when im waiting for appointments im sure i can fit it into a larger pocket but im afraid of it getting damaged i know they offer covers for it but im not sure if that would help or not,nice
3.0,i only wish it had a light so i could read in the dark,nice product
5.0,i received this for my birthday and i love it i had no intention of getting a kindle as i have long standing arthritis and didnt want to deal with any buttons when i happened to come across how it was going to be updated to touchscreen i knew i had to have iti read everyday and still read actual books however for authors like phillippa gregory whose books are enourmous the kindle has been great it is as light as they say i work for the local library and read so much and now i can get downloads from two different libraries and using amazon for lending is very easy especially if you register your kindle under your amazon account then you can manage however you like all the booksthanks amazon for another great invention,for everyone
1.0,i dont like this version i have owned a kindle since the second generation and this is not what i like i only received this as a replacement to my kindle keyboard when it died the kindle paper white does not offer text to speak so this was it im already out of space with downloading my previous items how is that even possible please bring back the kindle keyboard i dont like this version i have the first generation kindle fire and that is good enough for me please please please bring back the keyboard or equip the paper white with text to speak,not the best
4.0,this is my first kindle as a busy college student i bought this item for leisure reading in my free time i love its compact size and that i can download books very quickly and easily i read from it between classes and on my commute to school i like the fact that it is easy on the eyes and relatively easy to navigate i love the dictionary i would not otherwise take the time to look up words i dont know the fact that there is no backlight is no problem at all if there is enough light in the room to read a book then you read from the kindle actually i think the kindle might be easier to read in low light than some books due to its bright background the lack of backlight will be a deal breaker if you like to read in the dark the special offers are not intrusive to me and occasionally some of them spark my interest overall i like it it is great for what i use it for i would definitely make this purchase againnit picks1 i hate when dust gets on the screen it makes it appear like pieces of the letters did not materialize i got the amazon case to go with it and dust particles still get on the screen not a big deal though debris have a much more negative impact on eink screens2 i wish there were instructions on all of the features on the kindle there was a short tutorial upon set up but i run across other features that i would like to know function of3 because people can selfpublish via amazon there are a lot a crappy books out there for cheapfree but dont be discouraged there are good ones too4 i wish the transitions between tasks was smoother it would be a much nice experience i definitely would not use this to browse the web,it is great for what i use it for
2.0,do not purchase this product if you like to read at night i read a lot especially at night when the wife is asleep per some reviews ive read and pictures ive seen i assumed that i would be able to read with this kindle in the dark well i was wrong unfortunately i did not discover this until i turned it on,do not purchase this product if you like to read at night
1.0,this is junk it does not have a screen light adjustment feature according to some amazonkindle customer service reps another rep said it was defective but no replacement offfered instead i was transferred to the previous mentioned reps insult to injury i had to take it to a ups drop off and was charged 200 for printing the prepaid return label,no screen light adjustment apparently
3.0,neither the person who gifted this to me nor i understood that ¨special offers¨ meant i would be constantly seeing ads on the home screen despite having paid for both the device and the content i am accustomed to seeing ads when they support content or services i am not paying for but this is just annoying perhaps i will just avoid buying my ebooks from amazon using only ebooks borrowed through libraries for instance i already had kindle support on my smartphone and prefer paper books most of the time probably why i am a late adopter of an ebook reader the ads make it even less appealing,didnt realize we bought an adsupported device
5.0,excellent product,five stars
3.0,not bright enough,three stars
5.0,i love my kindle,five stars
5.0,at first i found this kindle different enough from my earlier ones that i did not like it but imdecided to give it another try and i am finding that i do love it i like the touchscreen very much as well as the fact that it turns off automatically when i close the coverbe sure to purchase a cover the cost of the kindle is so reasonablei find that i save it within the first 7 or 8 months after purchase,the kindle is one of the great inventions
5.0,i had an earlier model that was not touch screen the new version has more space and touch screen navigation i really like the size of my kindle it does fit into a pocket and is easy to hold and operate with one hand the glare free screen is easy on the eyes and more like reading a paper book i really like that the font size and style can be changed to what suits me and anyones preference if your eyesight is not what it was you can adjust the kindle to a more suited size i like that i can store hundreds of books on the device so i can read several books without the cumbersome task of carrying multiple books i also like the built in dictionary that enables you to look up a word within the book you are reading the price for the device is great amazon makes this affordable for anyone the many days battery life is also a great feature this device has really made reading so much more enjoyable if you like to read or need to read you should get a kindle,the most affordable ultimate reading experince
5.0,after years of using the kindle software on my 7 tablet with no problem i recently began to develop eyestrain after reading for long periods of time that doesnt happen with the kindles glarefree eink screen even if i use it with a small book light for reading in bed the display is actually much sharper than i had expected for a nonbacklit screen another unexpected benefit of the kindle over my tablet is that it is so lightweight its easy to hold in one hand and the touch screen makes it easy to turn pages while doing so i absolutely love my new kindle,great product
2.0,this kindle functions and lets me read ebooks thats the positive the negative is that i used it a lot this past weekend and the battery was draining very quickly i really dont trust the stated battery life on it i did have the wifi on but still one weekend shouldnt kill a device that can go for weeks on a single chargeive owned a kindle touch loved it but lost it a kindle paperwhite gen 2 but had to stop using it before bed because it interfered with my sleep so i went to this one by comparison this one is larger but lighter it feels somewhat hollow in comparison to the pw2 the pw2 also had a better feeling back on it one would think if they made a bigger kindle with less in it that the battery would be betterat the end of the day yes youll be able to use this as an ereader is it all thats promised probably not could it be made better to be more on par with its predecessors yes it is however cheaper than the predecessors so that explains a lot too for me ill probably use it just for traveling where books are more cumbersome or for when im reading fiction for more important items ill no doubt continue using physical booksin other words i expected to love this device like my previous two but i dont ill wait to critique the case for it separately thats absolutely overpriced and under engineered,not the biggest fan of this version of kindle
5.0,ive got two of these devices for christmas presents so far they are working fine i have not used them to much yet i have had a kindle device before 5th generation still working like a champ i hope my mother and brother are going to love them as much as i love my old kindle,nice device
5.0,loving my kindle decided to try a kindle with the big amazon sale a couple of weeks ago and see if i liked iti just carry my little dude everywhere and can read anywhere i want i love love love it im an er rn and now just relax and read on my lunch break and am enjoying it,love it
5.0,love it more portable and versatile than original kindle a tough little piece of hardware that goes anywhere amazon does it again by offering for free all ebooks from my previous versions library if you dont love amazon you dont love america ,love it more portable and versatile than original kindle
5.0,i love my kindle,five stars

1.0,ordered wrong item,one star
5.0,i really like it so far the touch screen is responsive and i love being able to access my kindle library and amazon to buy new books directly from the device it syncs perfectly with the kindle app on my iphone and ipad battery life is good so far and the special offers on the display are not distracting or annoying at all so its worth it to save 20 it is so lightweight i also have a first generation nook and this is a nice change its easier to download books through my library and the syncing between devices is much better,i really like it so far
3.0,good for the money,three stars
4.0,perfect nothing wrong with it but i am one of those who had the old paperwhite and i like touching the side button to advance the pages when i swipe to change pages with this version sometimes it does not advance causing me to swipe twice just a little annoying,reliable with good content

1.0,did not work upon arrival spent 2 hours with support and had to ship it back makes me wonder if it was returned by someone else arrived with spanish language on it and defective,broken
3.0,it is light weight easy to use with many nice features,easy to use with many nice features
5.0,i am glad that i purchased this item i purchaed 3 books just after unpacking device for use if you are on the fence about ordering just go ahead and do it you will not be sorry the product description is very very accurate in describing what the product is and how it performs definitely a good buy ,good solid purchase will pay for itself 
4.0,love the lightness and small size screen doesnt turn kittywonkas when not straight a real plus easy to read easy to turn pages forward and back just by a tap on either side of the screen basically this has replaced my kindle fire for reading purposes it was easy to transfer my ebooks from the kindle fire to this,great little ereader
4.0,i had been reading books on my old kindle fire 1st generation it was alright but my eyes got tired quickly and i was finding myself distracted doing other things with the tablet also the fire is a bit bulky and needs constant recharges i wanted something distraction free and easy on my eyes this kindle 7th generation is perfect for me the eink display is gloriously clean and crisp the touchscreen is snappy and responsive i have to give my old fire credit for getting me back into reading but i can tell that this new kindle is going to to keep me reading far into the future my only qualm isnt with the device itself but with the bait and switch on shipping i received when ordering it when i made the purchase i was promised delivery on a saturday if i ordered within the next hour and a half i placed the order but when i got the confirmation email they changed the guaranteed delivery date to the following monday i dont appreciate the bait and switch the package could have been stolen while i was at work the reason i ordered 1 day shipping was so that i got it on the weekend when i was home,great product bait and switch shipping
5.0,meets expectations,five stars
4.0,very easy to use and no problem with charging the battery would recommend for anyone with difficulty holding larger ereaderslarger size kindle is preferred but this is easy to carry in your pocket or purse,very easy to use and no problem with charging the battery 
2.0,this kindle has no light not happy i own 4 kindles and bought this one for my grandson for christmas took for granted that it had backlighting and it does not just ordered a clip on light for almost 20 so the poor kid can read the kindle in bed it is my fault for assuming that the technology of the paperwhite etc extended to this newest model mistake besides this and the dwindling prime lending library i am not a particularly happy customer,beware no lighted screen
2.0,this is the third kindle i have owned although the size and weight have been reduced from the first original kindle this kindle is actually more difficult to handle the touchscreen is very sensitive every time i accidentally touch the screen the font changes or notes are highlighted or the page accidentally turns and because the area around the screen is smaller it is harder to hold unless you do touch the screen which causes font changes etc the kindle was a great little reading device now that it is trying to mimic apple products it has lost its charm,not a fan
1.0,i dont know if i just got a lemon but this thing broke within 24 hours completely froze up and would not do anything contacted customer service tried a couple of things again still wouldnt do anything was not able to come to a satisfactory resolution with customer service regarding a replacement so i ended up just returning this will not buy a kindle again for the few minutes i was able to use it just to set it up it was very slow to respond,will not buy a kindle again
5.0,i am enjoying my new kindle very much i appreciaed the ability to download easily books that i had purchased earlier the touch screen is very convenient and i love theease with which i can adjust the font size i have vision problems and moving to a larger print when necessary is most helpful,easily books that i had purchased earlier
1.0,complaints i had not understood that there was no backlight and it seems absurd to have to use a room light to read an electronic device maybe i should have dug more but the absence of this feature is not easy to find in the product description when you navigate the screen reverses shade to let you know something is happening it looks like the device is having a small seizure and is a poor design choice to show the thing is working properly the experimental browser is a confusing and halfassed feature does it work or not if no why ship it mine did not work i was unable to go to dropbox and access my library which was a critical thing for me,disspointing
5.0,bought this to replace my nook which died very happy with this model quick page turns the light gray screen is easy on the eyes and the battery last a long time before recharging i had tried the kindle paperwhite last year but the white screen a little bright for my eyes and wasnt happy with battery draining quickly so i gave it to a friend this one is perfect for my needs love it,very happy with this model quick page turns
4.0,it is as expected,four stars
5.0,nice reader works well and keeps a charge a long time tip on the screen though if you hold the power button in for a few seconds a dialogue appears so you can shut off the screen so it doesnt display the ads for other books or content you paid 20 less for also my cats seem to be in a pool to see how many times they can knock it off whatever table its on and it still works fine though i got the 3 year guarantee if i break it recommend it if you just love reading like i do with no frills,works well seems tough
3.0,not what i wanted,three stars

4.0,obviously the kindle is great with good functionality however i must admit i was disappointed to find that the kindle does not work with 5ghz wifi so if you have that in your home or office it may be difficult for you to instantly download and sync books,just didnt work with 5ghz wifi

4.0,my favorite kindle,four stars
5.0,i have resisted an ereader for a very long time because i have always said that i am a book reader and want to hold a book in my hands well for several reasons i decided to give it a whirl and figured i would go with the no frills version since it was less expensive and if i didnt like it i could pass it along to someone else with not much guilti love it several commenters have mentioned that it doesnt have a light and that is true so i read in bed with a lamp just like i would with a book and it has not been a problem my local library has tons of ebooks and with one click they are delivered to my kindlei still love the feel of a real book and have not given them up but i also really love the kindle and i wish i had not waited so long to get one,love it
2.0,text not much clear,two stars
5.0,i bought this as a gift for my daughter who is in her 20s and i think it may be on the top ten best gifts ever because she calls me almost every day to tell me how much she loves it she then proceeds to tell me what she is reading we talk all the time now about what books are on our kindles and we are loving it, i think it may be on the top ten best gifts ever because she calls me almost every day

5.0,i own the first kindle model made and when it died i was forced to buy a new one i am still getting used to the newer features but i do like it my only complaint is the process of switching my old kindle to the new one i found that all of my husbands books are now on my device and i really dont want them i alone have over 650 books on mine and have no need for his overall once i am more familiar with the features i am sure to continue to love the new as much as i did the old,good quality

4.0,it is great to use and the magnifier makes it great to read even when i dont have my glasses the only downside is it doesnt have a builtin backlight for night reading which​ i purchased a separate clipon light so as to not have to use a table lamp and bother anyone else in the room,it is great to use and the magnifier makes it great to

5.0,i previously have had 2 kindles generations with keyboards and have been very surprised by how much i like the touch screen i thought this would decrease the battery time or make reading harder instead it has been wonderful and im happy to have the smaller and lighter kindle i just went on vacation for 2 weeks and read about 5 books including going on wifi a couple times the battery is still going strong,love it high quality product as always

5.0,i got this kindle for points earned on a rewards program if i had bought a kindle outright i would have been inclined to purchase one of the upgrade versions on reflection i am happy i didnt spend the extra money this basic kindle version 7 serves my uses to a t this is my first venture into the ereader world and ive only had the unit a little over a week but it is a perfect fit for me i use it for reading while traveling in the doctors office or other occasions away from home when i have time to fill dont really need the extra stuff like a built in light and such just want to be able to read on the go without having to carry around a bulky book this kindle is perfect for me the battery is as advertisedstill well over half of the original charge after a week of use,i am happy i didnt spend the extra money

5.0,best value for money,five stars
5.0,i love this kindle i bought to replace my generation 2 or 3 kindle which still works 6 years later but doesnt hold a charge for very long i love the touch screen of course downloading is easy plenty of selections and the screen is awesome in daylight i cant wait to take this on vacation to the beach and be able to read all day this is smaller than my old one and even easier to carry everywhere i go love it,cant go wrong with a kindle
1.0,i asked for this as a christmas gift hoping to take advantage of the kindle unlimited offerings and my prime lending library one cant see what books are available for lending until you shop from a kindle device once i received the device and started shopping i quickly discovered that almost all the available books are either by unknown authors or are very dated none of my favorite authors and i tried several is available for lending only for purchase no thanks amazon i feel like you exploited my ignorance and now i have to pay to return your device i am very unhappy with amazon over this purchase my ipad does lots more than this kindle,none of my favorite authors and i tried several is available for lending
5.0,as with all amazon products this meets all expectations it even fits my old kindle case it is easy to use and the new features include telling you who a character in the story is with just one touch no bells and whistles just an easy reader,wonderful product
2.0,i cant tell if ive already read the book until i click on it,two stars
5.0,kindle me this what just trying to be funny a bit of humor writing out yet again another review i have 4 kindles so yes it works great kindle is the way to go i hope someday they will allow folders on them so you can have one folder for each subject matter and maybe even subjected why not,you can kindle this
1.0,switched for paperwhiteway too darkspend the extra money,one star
5.0,great product i had the original kindle with keyboard but thought i would try the new paper white i started with the voyager because it had the side button option for page turning i sent it back the first day not worth the extra money for the button page turners plus they felt awkward i am not sure why the page turning buttons were discontinued in the first place but oh well i then tried the newest paper white it was nice but i noticed little ink smudges on the bottom of the screen not overwhelming but enough to annoy me i thought it may be defective so i returned it and ordered another same thing i returned iti then ordered this product its beautiful the touch screen page turn isnt as bad as i assumed plus the touch a word and the dictionary comes up its sweet the main reason i wanted a new kindle is that the original one i had you couldnt adjust font size or type it was getting harder for me to read this new one you can i can see great without adjusting font size due to a darker option of font print very happy with this product so far would def recommend the price is great also compared to the new models if they would fix the ink smudge problem i would go for the paper white model but not until then,great product
1.0,ive had the product for 2 weeks and it already does not work,one star
5.0,this was my first amazon kindle and it was wonderful i didnt need light behind it if i start reading in the dark then jut turn on a lamp im still learning about all the instructions but its great to read especially when you got to many books on a shelf or when a book is very heavy to carry around,excellent
2.0,i still get a glare,two stars
5.0,this is my first kindle i love it i read the product specifications before purchase which clearly noted that it did not have a lighted screen im very happy with that as i dont want to read in the dark anyway i like all of the features that ive used so far i would like to turn off the dictionary there very well might be a way to do that and i just havent figured it out yet its pretty light weight and with the case purchased separately its easy to take wherever i want i love touching the screen to turn pages love the easy interface the one thing that i wish it did is to recognize if im viewing it landscape or portrait without me having to change it in the settings i have no need for all of the kidparent features so i dont care,nice looking easy to use definitely recommend it
4.0,overall i like the kindle a lot there are a couple of things that bug me though that keep me from giving it 5 starsfirst of all its slippery im not sure if they did that on our purpose so you would have to buy a cover but it can slip out of your hands pretty easilysecondly the touch screen can be kind of a pain in the backside if you move the kindle like stand up and walk around with it and you havent turned it off youre likely to move through pages unwittingly even just reading if you adjust your hand or your fingers slip you turn pages more of an inconvenience than a flaw but i really liked the buttons on the side for page turning,a couple of irritating things but overall good
5.0,great for the cash yo,kindle is money
5.0,love the touch screen,five stars
4.0,im not a reader at all ive always wanted to but ive never set as one of my priorities i always loved technology so i thought that it would be perfect to start reading on an ebook and it works at least until now ill update you all laterim not giving 5 stars though because it doesnt come with a wall charger i know that everybody should already have one at home but the one recommended from amazon costs 20 i would rather pay extra money to come with one than open the kindle box and didnt find one i felt the same when i bought an expensive glasses that didnt come with case i think that this is ridiculous because it doesnt cost a lot to them to produce it and they still want to make more money from us i know that this is how business works nowadays but if you want full satisfaction from your customer you should know that this is necessary include it on the price i am wondering if i will buy a phone in the future without a wall charger as welli already saw a lot of good reviews about the product itself so i wont talk about it,good product but what about the wall charger
4.0,ok,four stars
5.0,i love this kindle because it is basic i have a hard time with back lit screens so this was my first choice i dont use it as a tablet just for reading i went from the nontouch screen version to this one with ease,i love the simplicity
3.0,the fact that it does not have the backlight is a big deal for me,no backlight
5.0,this is my second kindle and i love it it is a great way to read books now i dont have hundreds of paperbacks accumulating all the time and i dont have to go to the bookstore when i need a new book,great way to read books
5.0,has worked very well,five stars
5.0,very accessible and easily understood controls i have next to no patience for learning the fine points of device use for instance no patience with my iphone but this was easy to use easy to read and downloading content into it was also supereasy thanks to it being preloaded with my account information easy works well hence the five star review,very accessible and easily understood controls
3.0,miss my lighted page,three stars
5.0,prior to purchasing the kindle i was adamantly against the idea of reading a book on an electronic device mainly because things like my phones and tablet had a glare to the screen and the phone was too small and the tablet was to big and bulky this kindle is like the goldilocks its just the right size almost the same as a paperback book and there is no screen glare,mainly because things like my phones and tablet had a glare to the 
5.0,i love the ereader,five stars
5.0,its awesome i wanted something i could read in the car so i didnt get a kindle fire it is a little hard to read the book covers on the home page unless i actually click on the book other than that there is really no problem at all if i am ever able to get another i will move up the the paperwhite,great and trouble free no glitches whatsoever
2.0,dim waste of money,upgrade
5.0,great little device i had a 1st generation kindle almost 10 years ago and this version so much improved much more compact with a sleek touchscreen and is very portable perfect for my needs and great for travel,great little device
5.0,when the offer ends,five stars
4.0,its abit smaller than i thought however i like that it is compact enough to fit into any of my handbags without being too clumpy i should have taken the advice of other reviews and gotten the upgraded version with a lighted screen this was my first time ordering a device of this type i am happy with everything else easy to use downloads pretty fast and the text is the prefect size for me,i like that it is compact enough to fit into any 
4.0,easy to read outside,four stars
3.0,i dont like the touchscreen every accidental bump or touch sends it off to whoknowswhere then good luck trying to find your way backthe onoff button protrudes out the bottom as a result any attempt to read with the device propped up results in it turning itself off i would be happy to flip it 180 degrees so the button would point up but there is no such option available i sure miss my old button operated kindle which was so much more user friendly i mislaid it somewhere and keep hoping it will turn up one day and allow me to toss this one in the back of a drawer and forget all about itbottom line it serves its purpose but its predecessor was a five star device,a shadow of its former self
3.0,i preferred the one with buttons my hands are large and its nearly impossible to hold this without bumping the touch screen which while useful doesnt really matter for a cheap ereader bring back a basic version with buttons amazon,while useful doesnt really matter for a cheap ereader
3.0,theres nothing wrong with it it works fine i just prefer the buttons to turn the pages instead of touching the screen and i knew when i was getting when i ordered it i find that i am more likely to accidentally turn the page i dont think its very userfriendly its hard to find what youre trying to get to i set it up for a 12yearold with the kindle freetime its kind of a pain i thought i would be getting emails alerting me to how much shes read and how much progress hes making but i dont the overall shape of it… i think i prefer the original kindle this one is thicker and the edges dont slope to near nothing like the original did i think i have normal size hands but it feels too small to comfortably hold and be able to see the whole screen i liked on the original one that you could touch the button on either side of the screen to turn forward or back depending on which hand you were holding it with this one forces you to use youre right hand to turn the page if youre holding it with your left handi wish i hadnt gotten the special offers thing to save money because now my 12yearold is seeing advertisements for things not meant for a 12yearold theyre not inappropriate they just arent kid friendly i like the images of classic authors like they have without the special offers,it does what it says but…
5.0,this is my third kindle i bought this one when it was on sale for 59 and did not buy a case for it i keep it tucked into my purse and can take it out and read if im in line somewhere i also own the kindle fire which i keep at home and bought a case for and watch streaming videos on,great inexpensive ereader
5.0,i have owned two eink kindles the keyboard models and several fire tablets even an ipad this is definitely the best experience for reading that ive had i love the size weight feel and utility i picked it up on prime day for under 50 what a steal,onehandy device
5.0,light weight and the right size for holding at just the right angle for comfort while reading makes kindle 6 an excellent reader the screen is easy on the eyes and the no glare screen makes it easy to read by the pool this is my second kindle i also have a kindle fire,just right
4.0,i chose to give the kindle a try rather than build another book case we have a lot of classics and newbery award books on our shelves and use the library extensively my hope is to transition many of those books to the kindle over time and use my current book cases for more reference type booksi like its easy on the eyes display as i spend most of my work days staring into a monitor as well as the dictionary and xray functions we do a lot of reading as a family and i am often asked what a particular word means the xray function helps show the kids particular threads amongst characters and within the plot so i am looking forward to using that in particularthe one issue i have with the product thus far is the cumbersome approach to managing freetime i have only had the product for a week but so far the only way i know to add books to each of my childrens profiles is through the amazon manage my device web page it would be nice if i could manage this on the kindle itself,good but freetime management is lacking
5.0,ive been holding out and reading paperbacks i finally pulled the trigger and picked this up i love the look of the screen looks just like the real thing but its also easy to hold you can also just place it on a surface and read without holding it,i love the look of the screen looks just like 
5.0,my daughter loves it she won it for her swimathon and thinks its the neatest thing ever reading has always been a bit of a challenge getting her to actually read but shes more excited to read on her kindle now,my daughter loves it
4.0,i use well in china ,four stars
5.0,amazon now has kindles at three price points and this basic model without the selfilluminated display is the perfect beginning point for someone new to ereaders and who might be uncertain about how much they will use the device compared to traditional booksthe display is suitable for normal lighting conditions but not dim light so if intending to use it for reading in bed and without a light by the side of the bed for illumination for example either the paperwhite or voyage might be a better choicethe strengths of this model in addition to the low price are the terrific battery life and the great amount of storage available since there is no demand on the battery to power lighting of the display the normal time span between needed charges is the greatest of any of the kindle ereaders the storage is the same as all of the three models 4 gb which is a tremendous amount of space sufficient for thousands of booksat 79 this can almost be an impulse purchase for many people and if the user later finds that an illuminated display is desired it can be a nice handmedown to someone or kept as a backup devicei have both the paperwhite first generation and voyage models myself noticing that many of the most recent reviews for this entry model are facile and useless i thought that a more informed point of view was needed this is an excellent product and amazon backs it up with superior customer service i can confidently recommend it to anyone who wants to check out what its like to own a kindle who doesnt want to commit too much money right away,the best entrypoint ereader for exploring the kindle ecosystem

5.0,i have used this kindle now for a couple of weeks and i enjoy it very much it is easy to navigate the instructions are clear and the screen is very easy to read i increased the font size as my eyes arent what they once were and i have no problems with it since i dont anticipate reading in the dark the lack of the back lighted screen doesnt bother me at all the touchscreen without the buttons is very nice i used to search for the navigation buttons on the older version my wife has but i can navigate with a single finger on this one i have recommended it to my wife and anticipate that she will upgrade soon,very easy to use

5.0,i am so glad that this has been updated to a touch screen format because the first editions were not userfriendly at allwe purchased 2 of the new editions for our daughters as a christmas gift they used the first editions when they were younger and we ended up shelving them due to constantly having to assist with navigation we havent had to do anything to help them ages 9 and 11 with the exception of setting up the accounts on the new editionsif your goal is to simply read and do light browsing on al gores internet these are perfect even my 74 year old grandmother who has trouble with her directv remote was able to use this bless her heart i am very pleased with the new kindle ereader,touch screen for the win

5.0,you can read the reviews on the kindle yourself i just want to point out something that was a bit of a revelation to me i had always figured that since i had numerous phones and tablets which utilized the amazon kindle app i would never want a kindle i decided to pick one up during a great sale just to see what they were like since buying the kindle i find that i read books much more often than before i had the kindle you wont be distracted with facebook or any of those other things that seem to distract you with constant notifications on the kindle its just you and the bookapart from all that the kindle is great its easy to use and the battery life is insane it literally lasts for weeks at a time if youve been on the fence about buying one just do it you will not regret it,i thought i didnt need an actual kindle because i had the app i was wrong

3.0,im so disappointed i absolutely loved my original kindle but suddenlyand for no external reason i could imagineit just stopped worked suddenly the screen split and i tried everything i could find on amazon and on youtube videos to fix it when that didnt work i ordered a new one of the same type they simple one when it came the screen was so much smaller the way it works is different and i need to download all 181 of my books one at a time i guess i accept that things change in a few years but this is so different than what i have that im very sad i loved my original kindle and it died maybe ill come to get used to this new one but it will take a long time my kindle is my refuge and the change is very sad to me,sad replacement
5.0,great easy to use cleat,happy with kindle
3.0,i bought this entrylevel kindle and quickly discovered that i like reading kindle books but in the end i regretted buying the cheap model because its not as easy to read as a paperwhite i subsequently bought a paperwhite and i like it much better,functional but display not so great
5.0,very pleased with it,five stars
5.0,t was a real bargain but i really didnt need it since i get kindle on my ipad but there are some books that will not download except on the kindle its wonderfully light compact and easy to read i travel with the kindle as well as the ipad and read only on the kindle thus saving ipad battery usage the price was my main reason for buying it,very light small enough to carry around yet large enough to read comfortably
2.0,loved the older kindle,two stars
5.0,oh my gosh i am in love i always assumed that a multifunction tablet would be more useful but being a reader and dad of teenage daughters i never know where my tablet is since my kindle is a reader not a gaming email video device nobody in my household cares about itbut i doit is easy on my eyes and i am so glad i now have access to the kindle lending libraryyesif youve never had a kindleand you are a readeryou gotta get a kindle,love at first read
5.0,easy to use i love it,five stars
5.0,omg i love my kindledont waste your extra money to remove ads it only display one ad when you open the book just swipe and read it does not show finger prints and you can read it very well in the light and outdoors even in the sun cant read in the dark unless you buy the light attachment separately,i love my kindle
3.0,i was very excited to receive my kindle but have found it does not meet my expectation i own a nook and was hoping that the reading of the kindle would be so much better than the nook the kindle is very hard to see the type unless i am under a very strong bright light like a very sunny summer day but i do not read in the sunlight i read by my bedside lamp and i have to have additional light to be able to read the thing needs some kind of adjustable lighting to be able to read comfortably my eyes are staining and i find that i keep a headache after reading a very short time i truly wish it could be used in any kind of light setting i know i will not be able to see a word on a airplane as i can not see without a bright book light added when i do read,regretfully i can not see the book to read
5.0,no need to say anything,real hero
4.0,i reviewed this already,kindle 6 glarefree ereader
5.0,i love my new kindle q,five stars
5.0,i got this right after christmas when it was on sale since then i have brought this into work every day so i can read on my breaks its so easy to use and i love that i dont have to carry a huge book it doesnt have a light and its slightly thicker than the paperwhite but for a basic e reader its amazing,best purchase ever
3.0,so far i have enjoyed it,three stars
5.0,if you like to read just read some books this is the best simple reading tool for you long battery life simple to use and a lot of free book to down load from amazon the only thing i can complain about it is you need to turn on the light to read which can be solved easily by adding a mini clipon light,long battery life simple to use
5.0,i really love my kindle,great product
4.0,i have had a kindle for 4 years i thought it might be time for a new one personally i liked my original one better this newer version has a touch screen for commands next page library etc instead of buttons on my original i think it is more difficult to use,not as user friendly as my original kindle
1.0,unable to activate kindle for amazon account  it may be a century link connection that i cannot complete have spoken with tech asking for password and have not been able to obtain one i can use i found a 26 letternumber listed for the wifi on this computer so far not successfulhavent bought a any books on line since this was received previous kindle quit functioning because only a half a page would be displayed i couldnt use it at all customer service is such a patience testor these daystry to talk to someone without a transfer transfer etc of your call to almost any businessjoyce peterson friend of joanne hickman trying to activate the above kindle,not sufficient instructions with product
5.0,this is my first ereader the text on the screen is very clear and is easy to read in the light a back light is not necessary as the screen is perfectly clear by regular lamp lightthe kindle is nice and light so you can comfortably hold it in one hand while you read the navigation is intuitive so it is easy to go to different sections of the book you are reading and then return to where you were originally readingthe touch screen is appropriately sensitive it has always registered my touch occasionally the page will turn if i accidentally touch the screen but that isnt really a problemthe settings menu can be a little confusing at times it is difficult to determine where the control is to adjust somethingoverall i would recommend this to someone looking to buy an ereader,the text on the screen is very clear and is easy to read in the light
3.0,disappointed that none of the 4 i purchased have the backlight my previous kindle was a replacement for the first generation i elected the kindle paperwhite as a refurbished replacement it had the backlight i failed to note that the new purchases do not have the backlight and that light being the only difference i find it shocking that there is a 40 price differenceso much til next time as ive only made two years on my previous 2 the 4 i just purchases were for my spouse grandsons myself,disappointed that none of the 4 i purchased have the 
5.0,the new and improved 6 kindle is great i have an i pad but this kindle is so much better for reading i can read for hours with the kindle but when reading with other devices my eyes get tired i cant believe they can make a reader this good for such a reasonable price if i could not purchase another  i would not take 1000 for mine,kindle glarefree touchscreen
1.0,dont like it that i cant adjust the brightness while trying to read inside,one star
5.0,i dont know why this is on my file or acct but item was ordered in error and returned so i dont really know how to rate it but we have other amazon items like the phone and tablets and are very happy with them,like the phone and tablets and are very happy with
5.0,i really like my kindle this is the second kindle i have bought love them,i really like my kindle
4.0,im loving it the font is crisp and clear the touchscreen is responsive but not overly so its easy to hold the beveled back is actually better than a flat one i find and contrary to many people i love the cloud collections it works exactly the way i intuitively think it should compared the kindle keyboard its so easy to download books from your archive move books between collections and remove books from collections and from the device all thanks to the touchscreen its fast and way more responsive than my kk what used to take a minute is now instant and because my books stay categories even if theyre not on the device i dont need to keep all 2000odd books on the device the only downsides i cant always figure out the exact view i want cloudon device collectionsbooksall and recenttitleauthorcollections all combine in different waysbut thats minor the biggest drawback for me is that now i have to actually move my thumb to turn pages whereas on the kk i just needed to squeeze im still too aware of the movement required although im sure ill get used to it and itll fade into the background besides all the good points far outweigh these two minor concernsoh another caveat kk collections are not importable to the new kindle some of my very old and since deleted collections showed up but none of my current ones im having to manually go through my books and add them to collections on the kk this would have been a nightmare on the new kindle its just unpleasant,huge upgrade from kindle keyboard
3.0,i got this kindle as a thanksgiving gift for myself it was on sale for 49 instead of 79 and i wanted to get it for a long time so i thought i would never get a better deal i ordered it and was so excited to open and start using it first thing that i hated was that it didnt have any backlight well i would consider it my mistake to not having researched all the models fully before ordering secondly i noticed that it was very sluggish and i also found issues with the touch responses there was a point where i literally hit it with my finger hard i know electronic devices really dont respond to force out of frustration but still wouldnt respond my next step was to just return it back sorry but its yet not at the true bechmark level of other touchscreen devices as it should be,so i thought i would never get a better deal i ordered it and was so excited 
4.0,i do wish i would have paid just a little extra for the paperwhite but this is still good its a little heavy and thick in my opinion i feel like it could definitely be thinner considering our 7th generation that we had for years was about 13 of the thickness im sure it has something to do with being touch screen i dont know it gets the job done though, little extra for the paperwhite but this is still good its a little heavy and thick in my 
5.0,easy to set up and begin reading i have not yet purchased any books instead im going through the free ones and have had many hours 9 books in 3 weeks of enjoyment with my kindle i charge it about once a week overnight while sleeping i prefer this model over the one with a backlight as those hurt my eyes after awhile due to the sharpness and contrast between the print and back light so far i have not been in a situation where i can not turn on a lamp to read if this is an issue for you buy the one with back light so you can read in the dark,easy to set up and begin reading
4.0,simple dedicated ereader with direct access to amazon does everything it says it will but nothing more great for anyone new to computers but powerusers will be disappointing by a lack of features taking away a star for this only giving it a plus for having an experimental browser though,great for anyone new to computers
3.0,screen too dark less enjoyable when reading should have chose the better screen,should have chose the better screen
2.0,i had high expectations and i realize that for fifty bucks i shouldnt have the screen is not white like in the picture more like grey when you turn the page theres no fancy animation just a black flash of the screen and then youre on the next page doesnt work with all books i bought it for college and my hope was to read my java textbook with it because the physical book is huge couldnt read it because it wasnt compatible i figure thats because of the pictures in the book does not display any color and you cant read at all in the dark battery life is amazing ill give it that left it on for weeks and it was still running if you want to just read basic books with no pictures in them and arent expecting actual tablet quality this works just fine if you want to read something with pictures in it it may not be compatible dont buy with high expectations its pretty slow and blinks at you when you try to do anything with it but you can read books with it just didnt fit my purpose luckily its only fifty bucks so im not super mad,didnt fit my purpose

5.0,great product to readers,five stars
5.0,i bought this for my nine year old daughter for her birthday in our tech savy family we already have thirteen devices between kindle fire phones ipads computers gaming systems etc with internet the last thing she needed was another distraction for the record these are my husbands and my devices and while it seems like a lot we are not glued to screens all day we are stationed overseas and its not easy to get books in english here and she has quite an extensive reading list for summer this is exactly what she needed the screen is clear it is very easy for her to navigate the dictionary feature is fantastic and she can read quietly in her room at night with her booklight she has been a fairly avid reader but now i cant keep get her to put her kindle down which makes me a very happy mom i had to use chat with customer service for a setup issue and they had everything taken care of for us within a few minutes great product and great support,these are my husbands and my devices and while it seems like a lot
5.0,i do most of my reading during my commute on the new york subway and on the lirr the last few years it has been easier to just play a game on my iphone while i stand in a crowded train flipping pages while holding on to a pole in a moving train is awkwardsince i got my kindle originally i bought it for the wife i have been reading every day and finishing books faster than i ever used to i love it,this little device got me into reading again
4.0,am enjoying the kindle just received i believe they called it a paperwhite but couldnt find out much from the customer service department i am replacing one of the original models ordered years ago and broken and replaced three times this is my fourth then the third was indestructible until it fell into the pool hopefully this one will remain usable for years to come my disappointment comes concerning the price of these older models charged to a loyal multiyear paying customer expecting a discounted price,my disappointment comes concerning the price of these older models charged 
5.0,after reviewing all the types of kindles i finally chose this on for myself my last one was a manual one with a keyboard it was easy to use and support was great when i had additional questions it came in black but i was sad to see it does not have an audio feature its really light in weight and using touch is fantastic this was a present from my husband when the other one malfunctioned when i was using it although there are not any stores in my area i finally found a best buy down by the mall the sales staff there were very helpful and the extended warranty a good buy also,new kindle is a best buy
5.0,fantastic gadget its hard to believe that you can read it anywhere in the worldon the airplaneship boat and numerous books that exist in the past we had to go to the library for a book now we have the library in the pocket,fantastic gadget its hard to believe that you can 
5.0,i am very pleased with my kindle it has a touch screen that is easy to use it is great for finding definitions of words i do not knowit is great to be able to transfer books back and forth with my wife i did find it somewhat difficult to set up it should come with more instructions however customer service was great when i called in,kindle 6 in touch screen
3.0,after using a tablet device and my cell phone for ereading the last two year it took some getting used to have a screen that required me to in a lighted setting it is easy to use and i love how long the battery lasts but the need for light is weird,ok but different than the other readers
4.0,one of the best products out there and well worth the price the only problem is that its not very pdf friendly i already had many pdf books and its hard to read them on this device if the pages are fairly large resizing of pdf documents is not possible or at least i havent figured it out yet,one of the best products out there and well worth the price
3.0,its ok for the price depending on the lighting in the room depends on the background of the screenwas going to return but felt i could deal with iti think i would have perferred the paperwhite as a upgraded version of the screenbut this is my first kindle so far just learning my way around it in different lighting in rooms as well as outsideso that mention u cant beat the price upgrade laterso its ok for me at the moment,its ok for the price depending on the lighting in

3.0,i am happy with my kindle i have had another ereader for quite sometime and bought this as a back up and to access books that are only offered on kindle there are several pros and cons for both my ereaders but i do favor my other one more because of some options that the kindle doesnt offer overall it was a good purchase,i am happy with my kindle
5.0,great product this is a replacement for my original kindle which was larger and required pushing buttons to change the page this unit is easily and comfortably held in one handdo not like the cloud feature as a library i much preferred the original format of all books shown in a list format however that is just a personal preference and has nothing to do with the functionality of the kindle unit,great product this is a replacement for my original 
5.0,this is my second kindle for reading books i so much prefer it to my kindlefire which is so heavy to hold it falls out of hands when i read in bed and bonks me on the face i paid 200 for it almost two years ago whereas i got this kindle for less than a hundred dollars its strictly for reading so far as i can tell this suits me to a t since thats all i wanted in the first place i love the paper surface as opposed to the fancy color one just give me an electric nonglare paper book electronic features included of course this product is a real winner five stars,i love the paper surface as opposed to the fancy color 
5.0,bought mine from best buyloving itmy first kindle i have the app in my tablet but nothing like the real thingand plenty of booksthe only thing i did was open an account and my book were in my kindle yesss,enjoying my books thanks kindle
4.0,though i have had a number of tablets this is my first experience with a kindle reader i purchased it because it was at a special price and because i looked forward to being able to read in the sunlight something that is exceedingly difficult with most tablets what i did not realize however is that these basic kindle units provide no internal illumination hence their extensive battery life they are therefore the polar opposite of a tablet they are wonderful for outdoor reading but not ideal for indoors unless you have adequate lighting i am still pleased with the purchase for it will serve its outdoor purpose very well,give and take away
5.0,love my baby kindle first one i have had and i love the size it fits in any purse and even some pockets there are no bells and whistles but you ccan read it outdoors in bright sun a requirement for me you need a separate light sourse to read at night not back lit it is not as fancy as the others you cannot check emailetc but this is exactly what i wanted for travel or just busy days when you end up waiting for a few minutes here or there since it is so compact fantastic,perfect in so many ways
5.0,got this after my old one took a dip in my kitchen sink i am very pleased with this model kindle the screen contrast is excellent and easy on the eyes highlighting word lookup and font changes are quick and easy wifi hookup is simple with wps library downloads work well the unit seems physically thicker and more robust than the previous version i got the ads model but they are unobtrusive and only appear when the unit is shut off the only two small nits i can pick are the touch screen is a little too sensitive so in many cases i actually prefer having the buttons from the old version but i am getting used to it and having to swipe the screen to begin reading is annoying if the passcode option isnt selected there should be an option to skip the swipe other than those two minor things this is an good bargain on a great reading device,nice device for the price
4.0,i had an older version and it feels and looks of better quality than this new one i do like the touch screen on the new one it makes navigation easier the whole thing is smaller than my old one which makes it lighter which is nice im just a little concerned how well it will hold up i passed my old one on to my sister i hope i dont regret it,good buy on sale
5.0,i received this as a christmas present i am thoroughly enjoying the ereader so much handier than physical books and definitely takes up less space i just wish it had a back light this is my only negative comment on it it would be nice if all the kindle ereaders manufactured included a back light,kindle ereader
5.0,this is my first kindle in about 6 years great product definitely like the glarefree aspect and the fact that it doesnt have all sorts of apps that distract me from my reading the last reason is the main reason i got it i have an ipad and an iphone both of which have the kindle apps but i always end up really distracted before long having something like this allows for the convenience of multiple books on a small device and the distractions are greatly reduced im happy with it,distraction free
5.0,very pleased my new kindle,five stars
5.0,im amazed with my kindle,five stars
5.0,absolutely love my kindle given to me as a birthday gift from my 2 nieces and ive had to discipline myself to keep my nose out of the latest book ive downloaded i love the various features especially the ability to highlight a word to get the exact definition if i dont recognize it and the ability to bookmark pages i highly recommend this kindle,wonderful
5.0,thanks excellent product,excellent product
1.0,this is our 4th kindle and cannot say i am impressed with any of them while they work everything is great however each of the kindles have just stopped working after just a few months and needed to be replaced the first three were 2nd generation kindles the first one lasted 8 months before it froze up and no longer worked since it was under warranty they sent a new one at no cost the second one lasted nearly 6 months before it wouldnt turn on at all since it was a replacement the warranty was only 6 months instead of one year so we barely got a new one under the 6 month warranty the 3rd one they sent us came with no warranty at all and quit working within 7 months so we decided to not purchase another one for 2 years then at christmas in 2014 we thought we would give it another try for a family memberbig mistake it is only the end of april and this kindle has already quit working they replaced it for free under the 1 year warranty thank god we bought an addition 2 year warranty at the time of purchasewe are very unhappy with the 2 different kindle devices we have tried 4 kindles total and would not recommend spending the money on it if you like to read from kindle download the app it works like a charm on my phone and tablet,4th kindle now all have stopped working in less than 1 year
5.0,when i received the kindle i couldnt get it connected so i called one of your help numbers the person i talked to spoke poor english it took 1 15 hours to get it to work and it cost me 180 in charges to fix a new project,the person i talked to spoke poor english it took 1 15 hours to get 
5.0,this is an amazing value its nothing fancy no colors or anything but it does the job we love the touchscreen feature its so simple the syncing is fabulous and everything is compatible it seems amazon has done a great job with this one,fabulous value
1.0,this description is misleading i thought it adjusted to the ambient room light based on the description same brightness as the room this device does not actually have a light adjustable screen,this description is misleading i thought it adjusted to the 
4.0,just recently got it not sure yet whether i like it i am a luddite and hope that i will be able to work this kind of touchscreen device which is a replacement for my previous original keyboard kindele,not sure yet will add comments later

5.0,love this kindle i bought this for my wife i have the older version and she has this newer one very easy to use and the screen is awesome i cant believe you can get a kindle for such a low price,kindle another great product
5.0,is my first kindle and i love this machine is super fast and have excellent screen,five stars
5.0,i own a 2nd edition kindlei waited to see how the 1st ed went before i purchased it i paid quite a bit of money for it even got the leather case for it a kandle light and even subscribed to a newspaper it came out around 300 dollars at that time but also had the free 3g for lifewhich was super nice i say was because well the kindle was in my backpack and met its end with being slammed into a corner of a desk that shattered the screen it sucked so when amazon offered the latest kindle for only 60 bucks i jumped on itnow it aint a voyager like i got my mom for christmas but its damn near close its way better than my 2nd ed ever was except for the advertisements being a prime member just sweetens this deal except for the advertisements i have to keep saying that because that is the only thing wrong with this model the nonadvertisement model would be better but man 60 bucks for a kindlethats like a nobrainer ill deal with these ads because they arent obtrusive i just would rather see the old screensavers than an ad but whatever a nintendo game is 60 bucks so is this kindle uh hello,get a kindle for the price of a nintendo game
1.0,does not come with manual or charger lucky that i have another kindle and can use its charger no where does it tell how to turn it off it is misleading that the battery is listed as 4 weeks when in fact if you use it only 30 mins a day it will last for 14 daysi will cancel the prime and books at 999 a month as they are only low cost books and you are limited as to how many you can downloadvery misleading all around,do not buy this
5.0,this basic kindle is exactly what i hoped it would be before selecting this i compared it to the features of other kindles and realized i didnt need all the bells and whistles i got it with the special offers and as soon as i click on home the offers go away not a problem for me it is easy to operate and easy to read,this basic kindle is great
3.0,i like it for reading,three stars
5.0,this is my second kindle i like this one so much better than the earlier version this one uses a finger sweep to turn pages that i find a lot easier than pressing a button on the side of the unit like my older kindle very easy on the eyes ive used it quite a bit since it arrived highly recommend,big improvement over earlier versions
3.0,its good product for kids,three stars
4.0,nice product but returned it for paperwhite version because im an idiot and didnt know that this version doesnt have a backlight i know they say you shouldnt read just before bed with an illuminated screen but its the only time i have when my wife is asleep,nice product but returned it for paperwhite version because im 
5.0,a wonderful piece of technology the technology behind the screen makes the reading feel more like paper changing from page to page is simple and fast the battery life is extremely longit also might helpt to mention that the size of this device makes it especially exquisite for me due to the resizing of pages to the not so small screen that gives you a better feeling of advancement i have a problem with big books where the pages contain small letters and long descriptions which makes me feel a bit frustrated by thinking about how the book will continue to be like this and gets on my nervesi bought this device on a special to try it out and im glad i did,just saying that this is
1.0,we didnt like this version of the kindle at all very hard to use finally returned it,one star
3.0,is seems a little underbuilt like a chaep toy and its hard to read in low like situations otherwise its great i love the touchscreen and its longer seriously battery life really kicks ass overall im pleased with my purchase,like a chaep toy
5.0,fantastic piece of gizmo yes it does not have a reading back light but i anyway did not want one and for the price i got it for was a steal anyway bottom line if ur a avid reader there no way u will not like this device ,fantastic and convenient
2.0,i bought this on the special july 15th sale i was in a hurry and thought it would be a great gift for my mother since i dont buy paperback books anymore very disappointed it did not come with a charger and again i didnt read what features it had or more importantly did not have,i was in a hurry and thought it would be a great gift for my mother since i dont buy paperback 
3.0,its ok i actually prefer the oldest model better this touch screen freezes up in cold weather the older model did not it seems buggy for example sometimes when trying to go to the next page it readjusts the font thats very annoying it should be a 2 step process to change the font yet when clicking in an entirely different area it changes the font with one touch and will get stuck like that i have to turn it off to change the font and then click to go to the next page its also really thick at least twice as thick as the first or second cant remember which version i had generation kindle,wish i hadnt upgraded
5.0,very light and easy to use,great
4.0,i like my new kindle but not as much as my old one that it replaced the touchscreen while convenient also drives me nuts im constantly inadvertently touching someplace and getting pop ups like font size adjustment screens dictionary screens and some screens that i just dont know what they are for and when i put it down my hand always seems to flip through pages by unintentionally touching the screen as easily as these unwanted screens pop up i have difficulty accessing my home page shopping and the web and it seems like i cant get to the end of books or get out of the crap attached to the end of them everything being equal id much rather have my old kindle working again,i like my new kindle but not as much as my 
1.0,not working with 5ghz wifi,one star
5.0,for the money this is great just large enough to read at night easy to find books one likes to read it doesnt have a light but didnt need one the pages are quite acceptable for reading highly recommend,this is great just large enough to read at night
5.0,does all that it promises,good purchase
5.0,been a kindle user for years a while back when i got an ipad began using the kindle app for ipad found that it used way too much memory on ipad so went back to a kindle reader love the newer small size couldnt be more pleased with reader and service,kindle user since they first became available
5.0,works great no complaints,no complaints
5.0,although i really liked my old kindle i am satisfied with the new one it is only a little sensitive for a touch screen but i will get used to it you were able to transfer my old books some of which i never read as far as it being refurbished if you didnt tell me i would have thought it was new,certified refurbished kindle
5.0,great lightweight device,five stars
2.0,honestly i didnt like it very much compared with my kindle keyboard i liked being able to select using the touchscreen for definitions etc but i much prefer the physical buttons for changing pages i also didnt like the way books are displayed i have hundreds of books and i give them a name that includes what order they are in the series unfortunately i cant even see that on the main screen in the kindle touch i have to open the book to figure out whether it is the next one for me to read when a series has 7 books in it that can be very frustrating i also want a better way to organize my books into collections i previously used calibre but to use it with this kindle i would have to jailbreak it which i dont want to do my next ereader may not come from amazon if they keep making it so restrictive for now im going back to my kindle keyboard until it dies,eh the kindle keyboard is better for me
5.0,love it we have two in use,five stars
2.0,no lighted covercase available small to hold and if your finger slips the slightest the page changes or the font changes or it sets off the dictionary touchscreen is very sensitivenot an easily handled device at allit reads fine about as good as any other and the battery life is as expectedoverall i am disappointedpage turner tabs should be an option and someplace to actually hold it more than the 12 inch provided,not an easily handled device at all
4.0,very good if i must say,very good if i must say
4.0,i love my kindle there is a little scratch in the screen so its a black spot but i have 80 books on it and it doesnt hurt my eyes i have a lot of eye problems its super light and i can bring it anywhere,came with a scratch but love the device
5.0,i used to read one book every day when i was kid now i dont have time or i cant read for one hour because i start being bored of reading one subject or 1 booknow with this little device i can read a lot of books in same timelight weight and user friendlyi spent 50 and its totally worth it,i love it
5.0,my old kindle didnt work we ll after an update so my daughter bought me a new one the glare free kindle is very nice and i can read it anywhere i like the fact that does not have back light as that is not favorable for sleep,the glare free kindle is very nice and i can read it anywhere
5.0,i love my new kindle touch i have bought 5 kindles over the years two for gifts and 3 for me i prefer the newsprint over the paperwhite paperwhite is to bright for my eyes i love the touch screen which so easy to use it took me about 5 minutes to get it up and running its a lot of product for little money my books go everywhere with me and new books are so easy to download buy one and love it,i recommend this kindle touch for everyone
3.0,didnt see that this one has no backlight i really miss that feature would not buy it again,three stars
4.0,the screen resolution is good but if you have the money buy the 300dpi versionbacklight is also important i am impressed by the kindle but i will definitely buy the one with 300dpi screen resolution and backlight in few months once i am used to carrying it everywhere without losing it ,the screen resolution is good but if you have the money
1.0,amazon has a great team of customer service that can pass a customers one simple question to numerous people for 2 hours and still can not offer even one moronic solution given this experience it is really doubtful kindle is worth its high price no matter what version of kindle you purchase once youve encountered their customer service when you need help you will know what a nightmare is ,kindle has a customer service team called nightmare on amazoncom
4.0,very light easy to read only problem sometimes when i tap the screen to go forward or backward it just sits there working on getting past that fits in my purse and is very easy to read on the bus main reason i got it good value for the price,easy and light
1.0,trash totally defective and very not user friendly impossible to adjust the brightness,trash totally defective and very not user friendly 
3.0,i love to carry this around and read from it however i had to exchange it because it would no longer charge now the same problem has occurred again this time i googled kindle does not charge and found a solution that seems to work how long this will work for me i dont know what would happen if i became dependent on amazon for all my reading i dont know i recommend you think about it,look for the charging workaround before you buy
1.0,received broken returned it,one star
5.0,great deal on a great product however i now wish i had the one with the ability to background light so that i could read in bed without disturbing my husband the size and weight of this product is wonderful as i can easily slip into my handbag without worry therefore i am reading much more,great deal on great product
5.0,excellent buy works great,kindle 6
5.0,the paper white screen is as easy to read as a printed book sometimes reading from a computer monitor strains my eyes but the kindle does not do this i am very pleased with it and would recommend it to any one,great product
2.0,it depends on the paperback,two stars
5.0,my mother doesnt use electronic anything until now she loves her kindle i put the kindle on my account and said i would buy books for her for the rest of her life i really thought she might be intimidated since she doesnt use email or a cell phone but she is really reading a lot,loved by a technophobe
1.0,it was way too complicated,one star
5.0,i was debating on getting the basic kindle or the paperwhite kindle so i went into best buy and saw the little difference between the two the paperwhite has a backlight for night time reading and a slightly higher resolution but thats all if you want to spend 40 more bucks for a light that you can simply turn on a lamp or get a clip on light for less than five bucks and the reolution isnt a big deal if you are reading books because most of the time its not like your going to zoom all the in so if you just willing to do 40 more bucks just for a backlight then be my guest but the basic kindle is a bang for the buck it even has the anti glare screen which is amazing but it all depends on the person if they like the fancier version thats seems to me like a waste ot 40 bucks that you can buy a couple books with,basic kindle vs kindle paperwhite
5.0,amazing reading experience,five stars
5.0,i honestly was hesitant to ever switch to an electronic device i love my paperback books but this is awesome no driving to the store or waiting on the mail to be delivered i just search and buy its pretty clear and easy to ready as well might even get a kindle fire for the hubby,worth it
2.0,disappointed i have a really old first generation kindle that i love i bought this one for my 10 year old who loves to read when i opened the box i noticed that it was made of much cheaper plastic i soon realized that there was no sound or headphone port to use for audio books i also discovered that unlike my nearly 5 year old kindle i could not add any games all i wanted was a scrabble or word search game as it was a christmas gift i could not return this and i would have all i wanted was a reading device with a couple bells and whistles the option of an advanced reading audio book or a word game this delivered none he loves it but i am disappointed,disappointment
3.0,i really like it but there isnt a light like my cell phone so i can read it in the dark,i really like it but there isnt a light like my cell 
4.0,good size and so far so good just got it last week but i was able to sync it with my existing kindle account after my old kindle died im very happy with this so far easy to use and clear menu bars and prompts,good size and so far so good just got it 
5.0,love love love my kindle this is my second kindle given to me by my son i have given 2 gifts of kindles they love their kindle easy to see the words compact lite weight for easy travel to appointments or trips,fall in love with your new kindle
5.0,cant beat it for the price i brought this one for my dad so he could read the bible in large print and not have to worry about tearing pages he could simply touch the screen and it will go to the next page it is a christmas gift so i wont know how he likes it until then however i played aroung with it to set it up and i love it,love it
5.0,this suited all of my needs great product low price and easy to use i have a top of the line tablet i use for ebooks but have problems seeing the display in sunlight the screen on this product can be seen in the brightest conditions i definintly recommend this to people that read a lot of books,great product low price and easy to use
5.0,what a magnificent little thing the battery lasts for a very long time and the screen feels like a natural paberback without the glare of tablets or phones which is very pleasing to the eyesportable light and durable i bring it nearly everywhere now if im stuck on a never ending torturous line dmv anyone at least i have a book in handy,a livesafer
5.0,had an old style one with keypad and bought the new one after my old one broke i like this version a lot more as it seems easier to use and the keypad which i never did use much doesnt get in the way so far solid and dependable,a great product
3.0,its ok less than i expected,three stars
1.0,really disappointed in this product that i shipped to my mailbox then to uae dubai the screen definitely has issues the screen keeps twitching each time i load a new page it takes time to display clearly it turns all black then all white horrible experience,really disappointed in this product that i shipped to my mailbox 
3.0,not happen with the kindle 6,three stars
4.0,love it no worry about glare for use outside only reason not five star is finger page turner sometimes slow or flips backward probably user error but i had previous push button and worked perfectly,love it no worry about glare for use outside
3.0,good enough for who its for,pretty good
5.0,this is my 3rd kindle as with any new electronic gadget there is a bit of learning to be done i now love my new kindle as much as i have loved my kindles before the reason im on my 3rd kindle is that they break for no apparent reason one day they just dont work any more my last one just couldnt be woken up it must have been in a deep coma troubleshooting with one of the amazon technicians did not bring it back to life i had that one for about 1 and 12 years it was a replacement for my previous kindle that also had succumbed to sudden death after about 2 years that one was still under the extended warranty i had purchased so my 2nd kindle was free when it broke the warranty had expired i had to pay for my new kindle and i also purchased an additional 2yr warranty in fact i was so discouraged with the kindles that i first bought a kobo to my dismay i found out that kobo and kindle do not speak a common language the kindle app could not be downloaded onto the kobo all my books some of which i had not yet read were for kindle so what could i do since my ereader is my favorite thing i bought another how sad that amazon is unwilling or unable to create a kindle with a respectable life span id like to add that i have always treated my kindles with as much care as i would treat my first born son,condemned to keep buying kindles
1.0,very difficult to negotiate,not for the elderly or the very young
5.0,i absolutely love it i have the original kindle still but this one can fit in even my smallest purse im visually impaired so i was apprehensive if i would be able to read the type i can see it just fine great purchase great price fantastic product,fantastic

4.0,i like it to touchy at times,four stars
4.0,i love the portability and no glare of this device my one issue is not being able to switch from a book ive finished and a new one without having to restart the device its sort of frustrating but its great for reading i can finally read without getting a headache from the glare of the screen from the kindle app on my phone,very much enjoying it
5.0,my 2nd gen kindle died and i didnt want anything fancy as a replacement the 7th gen basic works great easy to get used to the touch screen so totally satisfied i do like the smaller size as well,completely satisfied
4.0,the unit is great the instructions that accompanied it are among the worst ive ever encountered which then required a couple calls to kindle support the people who answered the phone knew nothing the supervisor i eventually requested to speak with was terrific great help all working just fine now,the unit is great the instructions that accompanied it are among the 
5.0,for being an ebook reader im very happy with this device i got it on sale for 60 and it does exactly what i want out of ebook reader it lets me read books and has a good battery life im still disappointed that kindles dont natively support epub format but thats amazons fault not the kindle my previous kindle and my wifes both kindle keyboards started freezing up after a couple years so i couldnt unlock it apart from a device reboot and from searching online it seems it could be down to the battery so only time will tell if this kindle suffers a similar fate down the line as of right now though it does the job and the ads only appear on the unlock screen so dont intrude on reading im happy with the discounted price for an inconvenience i dont even notice,it does the job
4.0,perfect for my next vacation,four stars
3.0,as i just got some books loaded i havent started reading yet do have a problem being a dummy i have trouble learning it printed off the kindle users guide have trouble understanding some things and there isnt anyone close i can go to for help live in the boonies put all my books in a collection only have one series now when i tried to put in the order i want to read them they just jumped all over the place i tried last one first then first one first neither worked,as i just got some books loaded i havent 
3.0,i was pleased and satisfied ,three stars
4.0,nothing left to say about the good things of this productits the best thing for book loversmy only concern is that the screen flickers whenever there is a change in the content that is being displayed i am not sure if this is normal if it is then it doesnt feel good to me,only 1 concern screen flickers whenever it has to refresh contents for display
3.0,it is good i really like it,three stars
4.0,this replaces an older kindle for my husband it took a little getting used to the touch screen but he finally got the hang of it the older kindle stopped working just died but after we replaced it it suddenly came back to life but he seems to prefer reading on the new one so i guess he must like it after all,replacement kindle
3.0,not a big fan of the no light,three stars
5.0,there will always be a place in my heart for the real deal the smell of a book and holding one in my hands but i have to admit that so far i have loved using the kindle and i think it may encourage me to read more than i have in recent years ive barely read one full book in the past 34 years i cant say its 100 glarefree if i hold it just right the lamp light glares on the screen but its definitely not as bad as a shiny glossy finish would be im amazed at just how much the kindle really does look like the page of a book and i like that i can set my own size and font preferences so that i dont necessarily have to deal with whatever a book was printed in i have charged it once since i received it which was only a week ago but after several hours of use there is plenty of battery life left yetoverall for the amount of memory and the visual quality i think this was a great purchase for the price i did not get a case since i dont plan on taking my kindle anywhere so i cant give an opinion on cases,but i have to admit that so far i have loved using the kindle
5.0,prompt courteous thank you,five stars
4.0,perfect for my needs i purchased on black friday for 49 and knew what i was getting its light and uncomplicated and ive found it to be well worth the money there are some times i wished i had a light but for 49 i cant complain its my 3rd kindle and theyve come a long way since the old days i just wanted something light and easy to throw in my bag,perfect for me
3.0,did not come with a usb cable,three stars
5.0,ive always heard good things about kindles and have had the opportunity to use friends and familys kindles in the past finally broke down and purchased one and am happy with it easy to read light weight and touch screen battery life is topnotch as well cant complain one bit,no complaints at all
3.0,after being used to my kindle hdx this one was a real let down yes its a lot cheaper so the features will be a lot fewer however it cant cost that much more to add a backlight so you can read it any time day or night you can find other ereaders for half the price that do the same as this one its just a reader,lot less than bargained for
4.0,the reason for only 4 si thisit is really touchybut i will keep going for the gentle touch,four stars
1.0,i cannot figure out how to turn it on all i can get are the book ads it asks me for a password which i have never given it nor will it let me give password im looking for some help with this and not finding it on line it is useless to me until someone can tell me how to turn it on and get something loaded on it that i can read,i cannot figure out how to turn it on 
1.0,i almost sent it back the day i got it because it was so hard to turn on i downloaded info as have others from the internet but iit was still glitchy it takes a long time to boot up and the screen is so dim that even with light and large font its hard to read i am so so sorry i bought thisi am a huge fan of kindle in general my really old one still works more or less and its so much better than this one that kindle should be ashameddont buy it,waste of money and time
5.0,just fantastic i have the first generation kindle also which had the voice thing so it could read the book to me but i barely used it this new version doesnt have audio capability but its light and easy to operate this is the base model so it can only connect via wifi,perfect
4.0,still getting use to it dont like the idea that if i have a problem trying to figure out some function i have to locate the online manual try to remember what i read then continuing to try to solve the problem i need a guide to follow alone with problem solving amazon should offer a printed manual with each reader,dont like the idea that if i have a problem trying 
5.0,i have always hated reading when i was little but now that i am older i wanted to pick up reading because i am having difficulty writing and expressing myself clearly i was looking for a single purpose device without any possibility of app distractions and this kindle so far have delivered it is simple to use and the fact that it has no backlight it doesnt make my eyes feel tired,a device that helped me focus on reading
5.0,great value with good support,five stars
3.0,i bought this because it is easy on the eyes which it is extremely good in that regard i give it three stars because it takes significant effort to read pdf files on this machine also my kindle doesnt connect to my computer as a usb drive i suppose i should call the company but wifi transfer of files is sufficientjust fyi for pdf file enthusiasts like myself the files do not show up well table of contents is mixed upthe formatting is way out of whackthe mobi files are perfect and even though there are converters out there the conversion yields the same resultsfor 64 after all is said and done its okay is a fair assessment as i havent decided to sell ityet the one thing that i hate the most is while you are reading a pdf or converted pdf to mobi you hit the page back button and it returns you to the first page so you have to keep track of where you are in the document and pull up the bottom screen menu to return to where you werewhich i havent even bothered doing yeti wanted to relax before bed and read programming etc books before bed but having to keep track on the index where you are in each bookits okay,not a good choice for pdf reader even with conversion to mobi
2.0,i was hoping for more features,two stars
2.0,touch interface is not what youd expect from a modern touchscreen and less practical than the old buttons user experience and navigation should be completely rethought quality of graphics is poor zoom is useless for graphics,a step back relative to the original transition to touch is far from complete
5.0,great for reading by the pool,five stars
5.0,i got this as an early christmas gift from my mother at first i was disappointed because i was expecting to get the paperwhite version but this quickly grew on me i actually prefer not having a glaring white lit background while reading this is much more akin to what an actual page out of a book might look like i love that i can easily hold this in one hand and read depending on my sitting position even though my hands are small it still fits comfortably for me i have had this for about a week and a half maybe two weeks and ive already zipped through a few books im very happy with this if youre trying to decide between the paperwhite or getting this version just get this one it works just the same as the other one and you arent really missing out on any special features,great product
3.0,does the job a little pricey,three stars
4.0,i mostly love my new kindle i upgraded from my previous 4year old kindle and it is a much better piece of technology my only issue is that the font size seems to change by itself when i havent even touched the screen this happens often maybe its a glitch in my kindle maybe its an issue with all of these not sure its really annoying but it is still a great ereader,almost 5 stars
1.0,now to just be able to use it,one star
4.0,the book covers did not download and i was left looking at book names with no cover the man at the service help line was very pleasant polite knowledgeable thorough and after 20 minutes of trying different things we finally figured out how to make the covers show up service was excellent but i did not enjoy having to delete books off of the kindle to put them on the cloud to put them back on the kindle so the covers would show up the books on my cloud had to be queued onto the kindle then deleted off the device for the covers to show up on the cloud in my mind this type of glitch should not have happened half the books had covers half of them did not i own three kindles and this is the only one with an issue i bought it for my elderly mother to have books to read while waiting at doctor appointments this makes me question future glitches in the system,service was excellent but i did not enjoy having to delete 
5.0,shipment fast so far so good,five stars
5.0,i was always one of those people who wanted the book in hand and then read it and put it on the shelves then i started checking prices on book from amazon and a lot of the books i wanted were free or the most expensive one were 199 and for the price i paid for the kindle i just couldnt pass it up,i was always one of those people who wanted the 
5.0,easy to read and lightweight,five stars
5.0,got this kindle for christmas to replace my second generation one that finally broke after 6 wonderful years it is different to get used to after my last model had the keyboard and this is touch screen i love this just as much as my first one looking forward to many years with this one,great update from my 2 generation kindle

4.0,just got my new kindle two days ago much better than reading books on the iphone i like it a lot but dont like that i cant read it in the dark didnt realize this version doesnt have a built in light and i cant change the display to a black screen with white letters to read in lower light,cant read in the dark

5.0,i bought this for a lady i take care of so she could read without struggling to turn the page of a book it worked great and she love the fact that it is light and easy to use thanks for a nice transaction and fast delivery,great purchase and good service
3.0,got my kindle from prime now refurbished with the 20 off coupon for a total of 44 i like it the software is great and getting books is easy reading books is easy my biggest issue is the hardware this does not feel like an 80 product at all the case is made out of plastic that makes it feel like an old game boy and a few taps on the back make it sound very hollow inside the screen is fairly low resolution although eink is definitely much nicer to read than an lcd all in all i like it especially for the price i got it at but if i were a serious bookworm id spring for a higher end model,got it cheap the only way id buy one
5.0,i love the compact size of this kindle it is not lighted or backlighted so it does not cause eyestrain due to the glowing screen experience it charged quickly and still has a 50 charge a week later makes it easy to carry it around with me when i have to be in a waiting room i read a lot and this kindle reads just like a book without the weight of the book causing it to close unexpectedly and lose your place yep what i love most about a kindle is that you never lose your place even if you put the book on hold and read something else first the touchscreen offers a quick turn of the page with just a touch controls are easy to find and to use i bought this kindle for reading only and i am pleased,well worth buying
5.0,impressive the kindle reminds me of the tablets picard reads at his desk in stng also its nice packing this little gadget instead of lugging a 700 page hardback of ayn rand around you still need a pc or a fast smart phone to make it easier to load kindle but its aight,i can read
4.0,i always want to read some books before i sleep now i can do it with my kindle not using my cell phone and read all those junks at the very beginning i struggled whether i should buy the paperwhite but i finally chose this model due to the much lower price i thought i dont need a higher resolution at the end i think i missed a key feature from this basic model led light i like to read something before i sleep and i dont like to turn on the light so i need to do it if i want to read with my kindle nowbut paying 40 to upgrade to paperwhite for the led lighti really dont know,i like to read something before i sleep and i dont 
4.0,registering the kindle was really easy as i had had a previous one that eased a lot of my fears the written instructions are simple and easy to follow however the manual on using it is only in the cloud you can download it that means you need to experiment quite a bit to get to it i would have preferred a basic manual in writing its easy to read and light weight,almost perfect
5.0,this replaced my 2nd gen kindle and its better in every way possible and i loved my 2nd gen before i broke it the only minor complaint i have is the touch screen i would like physical buttons to turn the page swiping requires a bit of weird hand movement for me that my old kindle didnt require,awesome
5.0,i have been wanting to own a kindle for yrs but never purchased onethis was a recent purchase for myself as a christmas gift after reading the reviews the kindle ereader would meet my needs i absolutely love my new kindle👍,my first kindle
5.0,i have already read 6 books before buying this i had an old ipad with a kindle app it was heavy and it hurt my eyes every time i tried to read i love my new kindle easy on the eyes and i can stick it in my purse,easy on the eyes
5.0,this is one sweet little machine i have a fire and a kindle keyboard which got damaged when caught in a console latch in my car i use my fire first release for email and internet access i like the six inch kindle for ereading books it is ultra intuitive i really love it its beautifully manufactured and has a fabulous screen the on screen keyboard is so much easier to use then my older keyboard kindle im thinking the six inch kindle will be a great gift this holiday season several people all in all the six inch kindle is the perfect ereader,the six inch kindle is a dream of a machine

5.0,it is all we hoped it would be,five stars
3.0,not that easy to use slightest touch at edge of screen will put you three four five pages away from current position went to settings to insure not pestered by ads still have some i use kindle to read books and that is all this kindle not as good as 6 with keyboard i purchased about six years ago too bad,newer kindle is less
4.0,i was replacing my original keyboard kindle that i have used every day for over three years i tried a fire but really just wanted an ereader to read books without all the flash so i returned it and bought this this works well is a bit smaller and the screen is easy to read even in the sun the touchscreen display is much easier to use than the keyboard i do not like the fact that two of my favorite games cant be loaded onto the new device apparently it requires either the old 5way pad or a kindle fire to support the games im interested in playing i still have enough life in my old keyboard device to play my games but will be out of luck when it finally bites the dust,i just want to read books and play two of my favorite games
3.0,touch screen not as sensitive as id like but overall seems to work well searching for books on it can be painful with the touch and scrollingamazon when i type in something like the adventures of alice in wonderland free or through the looking glass free why are the free books buried deep down there should be a sort by price option maybe but ya it can be hard to find the free books on,touch screen not as sensitive as id like but overall seems to work well
5.0,great price love reading on this over a tablet got it for the kids so they can always have a book no excuses can take it to school because it wont do anything besides let you read well worth it,great price love reading on this over a tablet
5.0,wasnt sure how it was going to fare over paperback but i love it a little guy well put together and engineered fits right in my hand and the plastic has a nice tactile feel even the unboxing experience is pretty cool,but i love it a little guy
5.0,i bought this kindle for my dad who is 84 and loves it he has never used a computer or any other electronic devices but the touchscreen on this kindle made it quick easy for him to master turning the pages of a regular book had become hard because he has a tremor but with the kindle he can read with ease and total enjoyment we are both thrilled with how much he is using and enjoying this kindle,octogenarian loves this kindle
5.0,absolutely love this it does everything is says it does and if youre looking for a basic ereader and nothing over the top fancy this is for you my husband bought it for me as a gift for my birthday since it went on a super good sale and it came extremely fast love everything about it if youre looking for a case omoton has several pretty awesome designs to choose from and are great quality but wont break the bank,absolutely love this
3.0,just started using it i am slowly learning how to navigate it i think if it hadnt been given to me as a birthday present by my step son i would probably stick with hard copy books i appreciate that the kindle is compact and is essentially a library at your finger tips but i read 2 4 books a week and find comfort in falling asleep with a good book in my lap i intend to keep experimenting with the kindle in order to get adjusted to its capabilities,newby to kindle
4.0,the screen is a little darker than i anticipated and i assumed i might be able to change the brightness i have not discovered a way to do it but despite that issue it is lightweight easy to hold in order to read for longer periods of time it is good to have a multitude of books at my fingertips and all of them together weigh as much as a childrens book,easy to hold in order to read for longer periods 
2.0,perhaps i was spoiled by my previous kindle it had buttons and a keyboard on this one everything is done with a touch screen however after several months of using it it has become clear that the kindle engineering folks have produced a sloppy product1 the font changes size without any input from me2 using the go to screen is impossible because the slide bar to scroll down down does not work with either finger or stylus3 the slightest touch on the screen brings up the notes function which cannot be disabled4 a tap on the right side of the screen results in the screensaver coming up instead of advancing a page5 from time to time when the screen saver appears the only way to return to the book is to reset the unit and wait until it restarts6 when the unit resets while the books are still present you can not resume where you left off but must start from the beginningnote if the unit is never connected to a wireless network books copied to it from a computer via a usb cable can still be readother than these issues it remains a useful device that did not gain from the improvements offered by this generation,it remains a useful device that did not gain from the improvements offered

5.0,i like it more than expected its so easy to snuggle up with even if you are reading a 1000 page book it is still comfy to hold also super easy to carry with you the downside is that you might need to buy a cover for it if you carry it in a larger bag with things that might scratch it,awesome device
5.0,this kindle is a replacement for my old 2nd gen kindleold one with the keyboard and no touch screen ive had the old one since 2009 and had it destroyed in a motorcycle wreck 20 days ago first let me say amazon customer service was outstanding and this kindle is everything advertised and served me well on most of my 19 nights in the hospital following the wreck thanks amazon for great service and a great product,replacement kindle
4.0,this my 3rd kindlefirst just stopped working after 2 years the second one lasted until i dropped it into the pool wish there was a waterproof skin for it like there is for the phonesit is great for reading outside no glare,wish there was a waterproof skin for it like there is for the phones
4.0,it was a little difficult to get used to the touchscreen after owning a keyboard kindle but i expected that i do like the fact that it weighs less than my old one i havent had it long enough to do a real review of all its features but it does have more of them than my old one and i like the fact that i can switch back and forth between the two and my computers without losing my place,im glad that kindle still has just ereaders since im not interested surfing the web with it
4.0,i am very happy now the first few days were stressful i was showing my wife how to use it and as soon as she touched it it froze it would not respond to anything except a long power off i almost returned it but i have read several books since then without problem and prefer it to my fire based on weight alone,refurbished kindle is a great value
5.0,great product im pleasantly surprised at how easy and fast it downloads book product was as described with no misleading advertisement first book i downloaded was the road to surfdom and it doesnt disappoint i am sold on the whole ebook idea and look forward to seeing how well it works with textbooks for my college classes,great product im pleasantly surprised at how easy and 
4.0,great for outside reading and much lighter than hd one i have i use hd one as an audio book listener and this one for reading it would be great if it had some kind of light for darker roomsrainy days,very good
5.0,this is a great little gadget for starters it produces no light especially the blue tones which are proven to interfere with later efforts to sleep of course that means that you can only read when theres light available its light in weight probably about the same as a paperback book and its similar in size to a paperback best of all it looks like its battery lasts in excess of a week i couldnt be more pleased,i love this thing
4.0,not at all a bad e reader having owned several kindles in the past this was comparable to one of my earliest models the features are cool but reading is reading for the most part i returned mine only because i do need a backlight i read in the dark often until i pass out reaching to shut off my lamp is annoying so lazy i know if you dont mind needing a light on to read at night this kindle is perfectly acceptable i am ordering another paper white so i can have my back light back my last one had a pixel go out and i couldnt get past looking at it all are on sale right now so the deals are good,not bad but not for me
5.0,i love it so easy to see and read,five stars
3.0,im still trying to figure it out,three stars
5.0,perfect with special offer price,five stars
5.0,so easy to buy books from amazon,i love my kindle
1.0,keys dont work returned product,one star
2.0,i dont like the ads displayed when i turn it on i dont like its sensitivity often i inadvertently touch a part of the kindle that sends me off in a direction in which i dont want to go i had a traditional kindle before this one which broke when it fell i liked it better i am still getting used to all the functions i am sure someone younger than i 66 would have learned all the options right away i am taking a little longerone drawback to kindles is that charts graphs illustrations cartoons are useless too small to see,some drawbacks
5.0,i was a little hard to get going,five stars
1.0,it was broke when i received it,one star
5.0,i am very pleased with my kindle,five stars
5.0,love the kindle great product,five stars
5.0,i have had this maybe a week and a half i unfortunately have been in a spell where i am not reading as much as i like but that being said so far i am pleased with my purchase it responds quickly and is easy to read,i unfortunately have been in a spell where i am not reading as much as i like but that being said
5.0,i already owned the fire hd 7 which i enjoy very much the fire hd 7 works well as a tablet and a reader but it can get a little heavy after a long period of time and the battery life is limited in heavy use i decided i wanted to try a dedicated reader and i have been very happy with my purchase the kindle 6 glare free touchscreen is lightweight easy to use and i have not charged it in weeks even with everyday use this device is not backlit so you must have a light source to read by just like with a real book and it does not display color which is not a big issue if you need a color display you can always put the kindle app on your other devices highly recommended,lightweight and fun to use
5.0,this is a great new innovation to the kindle series this is my fourth kindle two have failed and i was ready to try a touch screen it is smaller and thus easier to carry but amazon has done a great improvement over the former touch screen technology,this is a great new innovation to the kindle series
3.0,i am having some problems with this kindle its freezing up ever so often and i just have to turn it completely off wait a while before turning it back on and then it will work for a while longer may have to send it back,i am having some problems with this kindle its 
3.0,i bought this for my 9 year old granddaughters christmas present i had forgotten how dim the pages appear on the regular kindles it is very gray and a light source is definitely needed when reading inside i would not have purchased this model if i had seen it in person should have bought a paperwhite instead,dim and dark
5.0,omg this is literally my favorite object in the world i love it i cherish it i have barely put it down since i opened it a few days ago as a commuter into nyc this is going to be my best investment ever especially since i got it through the lightning deal on prime day i had a charger butt already so i didnt need to splurge on the additional butt but i think its annoying that it comes separately i guess amazon has to make up for their unsurpassable customer service some howanyway i didnt buy a screen protector i forgot about it and im glad i didnt first of all i tend not to touch my electronics computer phone tablet etc with stickygreasydisgusting fingers so i wasnt concerned about that but i knew fingerprints could be an issue and later on pretty distracting for reading this screen is pretty matte to begin with and with a gently touch i havent noticed any prints or weird smudges on the screenalso the no button thing some people were complaining about i find as a nonissue just tap the top and its basically like a home button5 stars love it love it love it,this seriously cant get any better
4.0,i like this kindle much better than my kindle fire i have an older version of the kindle fire i had the very first kindle ereader and this one is very similar light to hold and great for sunlight etc i only wish it did light up for night reading with that said i use this one for daytime and my fire for night time reading,i like this kindle much better than my kindle fire
5.0,the kindle arrived on time and was packaged well i was able to quickly download my books from the amazon cloud to the kindle the screen is truly nonglare and i see plenty of reading time on this,very pleased with my kindle
5.0,i have an ipad so i didnt know how i would feel about the kindle but thought i would pick one up on sale and take it to the beach you can read the kindle in any kind of light with ease the controls and features are very intuitive and easy to use the amazon library of books is huge i found that the kindle and the ipad are not the same animals and that having one does not exclude the other,the controls and features are very intuitive and easy to use
5.0,i love my kindle this one i purchased for my granddaughter for doing so well in school shes an avid reader and i thought it would be the perfect gift ive used my ipad in the past but nothing compares to holding the kindle for reading,perfect gift
3.0,did not realize that i would not be able to brighten the screen at all so now i have ordered a light for it,did not realize that i would not be able to

5.0,kindle for me the best to read ,five stars
1.0,no reading light not good for me,not good for me
4.0,i should probably start my review by stating that ive never purchased or used a kindle before so i cannot compare it to other models the immediate issue i found with it has to do i suppose with my reading habits and not the device itself i like to read in the evenings after the day has wound down and by extension it is usually dark without a backlight or some other popout led i cant read it well books dont come with lights either so this is hardly the fault of the kindle so i searched for a case with a popout led suprisingly this is harder than it sounds after much searching i finally found one for 5999 exactly what i paid for the kindle itself so now it costs a little less thrifty 12999 well surely the books given that there is no printing or shipping involved must be fundamentally cheaper nah not so much some amazon sellers have paperbacks for less than the electronic version of the books i want to buy hmmmmwell ill say this for it i can pack hundreds of books in one little device and its easy to use and read so theres that 5 stars if you put on the sale page for my kindle here are some accessories that fit your device,very good with some caveats
4.0,i love the kindle for easily reading ebooks that i get for free from my local librarys ebook lending program or free through amazon prime though at times i buy books i cant easily get for free unfortunately though this is my third kindle in about as many years because my first one stopped working after about a year and my second ones screen cracked somehow for this one ive bought a nice cover that will hopefully keep it protected so it will last longeri would give it a 5 star rating if i didnt have longevity issues with my previous kindles,great ebook readers but are they made to last
5.0,i had been wanting a kindle reader for quite awhile and when it went on sale for 49 i couldnt resist i have a kindle fire tablet but i always found it too heavy for comfortable reading this new kindle is very light and easy to carry and hold im actually reading books again,id forgotten how much i enjoy reading
4.0,i really liked this its very easy to use plus the weight is really light and i can make the text bigger plus i can get my books a lot easier than i thought the only thing i dont like is that i have to go into a wifi hot spotbut other than that its very good,graces thought on kindle
5.0,i enjoy reading so i had to own one of these to avoid all the bulk books taking up space in my home this kindle came well wrap and very protected without damage small yes and easy to carry around in purse or bags very light weight and can be held with one hand for hours easy to purchase kindle books just a click away you have to be watchful when shopping in kindle bookstore because at a click of a button you can place an order and not even realize it that is how sensitive this kindle is have no worries amazon was great in reimbursing me and showed me how to turn off this feature in my kindle i have purchased books not only for me but my daughter as well who loves to share my kindle with me try this kindle you will not be disappointed,i enjoy reading so i had to own one of these 
5.0,i bought this kindle for my 10yearold niece and she loved it she said thank you so much auntie i got everything i wanted this christmas this came at a great price of 59 right before xmas too sorry that i cant comment on the performance of this item just wanted to share what a great gift it is for preteens,this kindle was a hit 
4.0,love it wish i had bought backlit,four stars
5.0,i was hesitant to get an ebook reader but i read a lot and the books were taking up too much space in our house my husband suggested we try the kindle and i love it i have been reading more because downloading books is so easy the battery life is awesome which was one of my hesitations about buying the reader,hooked
4.0,response time sometimes too slow,four stars
5.0,this little baby has singlehandedly kindled pun intended my daughters desire to read its a great morphing of the kindle paperwhite and the fire great for encouraging reading without getting a bunch of internet gadgets you dont want a younger child to putz with,great reading device
3.0,i dont like how dark the screen is,three stars
5.0,i love the kindle i just needed something to read on without other bells and whistles of tablets like the ipad works well and if you just need an ereader and not the other functions of a full tablet then this is for youbattery life is also long unlike tablets i can ready for 45 hours a night and it will last almost 2 weeks,perfect if you just need an ereader
3.0,lleno de publicidad es una gar cha,three stars
5.0,great reading tool that makes my life much easier this kindle is great for reading even better than my ipad it is really easy on my eyes since it has the same brightness as my surrounding the battery is amazing because i can charge it once for a month of reading the word wise feature is also great for reading harder books since it automatically translate difficult vocabulary into simple definitions i would definitely recommend it and buy another one for my kids,perfect gift for students
2.0,i need a back lit screen,two stars
5.0,very nice kindle great price too,works for me
1.0,didnt know it was black and white and to hard go to home screen if you were reading anything and the games dont work,not that great
2.0,the big problem with this edition of the kindle is there is no backlighting of the screen which makes it impossible to use at night without another light source and very difficult to use in the daylight outside my kindle is much older and has this feature backlightingchanging the color of the screen and letters which makes it possible to read at night in bed without disturbing my wife and living in florida it is a valuable feature when i take my kindle to the beach please dont issue another new kindle that will not include backlighting,the big problem with this edition of the kindle is 
1.0,too dark with no back light setting to adjust hard on my eyes maybe i received a bum one i will be returning it,too dark with no back light setting to adjust 
1.0,i had an earlier model that i liked you cant figure out how to use this one and you have to pay for instructions,i hate it
1.0,screen is crap when i flip the pages it stutters and is not smooth it takes a bit before the words on the page are even readable if i could return it i would just bought it black friday online from staples its not returnable after you open it and put books on to try it out spend your money elsewhere,get a nook i wasted good money on the kindle
5.0,this is a great reading device i replaced my first kindle keyboard which owes me nothing and functioned well for 6 years i read almost 500 books with that kindle while i could read on one of my other devices there is something so comfortable about a kindle seems just like reading a real book i love it mostly i download books from my county library,time for a new kindle
5.0,i never thought i would like a kindle or a nook i got one as a gift i am a book reader but i have really been enjoying my new kindle if your thinking of getting one get the kindle firethen you can join you library cloud,im a book reader but i love my kindle
5.0,great product thus far my first kindle i enjoy not having to hold the pages open and also be able to access new books via amazon account on my computer when i feel inspired to and not having to wait or trek to a library the display is comfortable to read from and easy to navigate although sometimes it can bit a bit challenging in comparison to a full on tablet display although i would take this any day of the week over a tablet for reading regardless of what i just mentioned i enjoy being able to touch anywhere near the edge of the page to turn to the next pagei have not tried other kindle products but do enjoy the newspaper style color scheme it is easy on the eyes im not sure how i would feel about a stark white back ground if that is what the paperwhite model offersbest feature a dictionary at a moments notice by simply highlighting a word you will get an inpage dictionary definitiondiplay with an option for wikipedia info it feels as if i can have a custom footnote at anytime for any word great for many uses also it then keeps track of the words you looked up in a vocabbuilder which is nice to review laterthe fact that the screen is not centered in the itemcase having a thicker dimension below the screen is actually beneficial as it allows the kindlebook pages to not be hidden behind the folds of a blanket for example so i am actually and very happy then it is not symmetrical top to bottomnegative mainly because i really dislike the means and methods of the advertising industry in general the kindle never turns off even if you turn the screen off by morning time there will be a display showing some book or amazon product for sale this feels imposing to my personal space as i often may leave the kindle next to my bed then to wake up and have an advertisement in my room just doesnt feel appropriate of course this is minor and doesnt ruin the product by any means and can easily be fixed by simply turning the device over for example but i wish i didnt have to see the advertisement each and every time as i openunlock my bookkindle just as i am getting relaxedclearing my mind from all the materialism and other issues of the world and am looking forward to reading maybe its an odd thing to mention but i thought it would be worth sharing,good product i have not tried other kindles but am very happy with the function and display
4.0,this is my second kindle and the first with a touch screen my only complaint is that i wish the borders black part were wider because every time i move or shift i accidentally hit the screen and then my page turns or some drop down pops up its really really annoying in that regard,wish the sides were wider so id stop hitting the touch screen and turning the page when i dont want to
5.0,my husband loved his christmas gift,five stars
4.0,i like how it works and i am able to understand it even at 73 years oldbut i seem to have lost most of the books i had on the other kindle i hadi saw them when i first opened this kindle so know they were there but cant find them now can anyone help me please,i need help in finding my lost books
1.0,cant buy most ebooks from china,one star

1.0,too dark cant not good on the eyes,one star
5.0,i am so far pleased with the 6 glarefree touchscreen i love the size and light weight because it makes it so much easier to carry it in my handbag when ever i go out and also when i travel on a trip i still have to get use to it and learn a few more things about it of course i made a great purchase and saved a lot of money when i bought it on the big sale day,i am so far pleased with the 6 glarefree touchscreen
5.0,great reader and very easy too use,five stars
5.0,what can i say that hasnt been said this is a great piece of electronic hardware its an elegant and portable way to carry your entire library with you for those bibliophiles out there this is a must have i wish i could transfer the books i own physically over to my kindle without having to repurchase everything,this is a great piece of electronic hardware
1.0,returned this item cause amazon didnt specify that it didnt have a black light on this kindle in fact i was reading others reviews and didnt even open the box and returned the next dayand the main reason i was even getting a kindle was to try to get back into to reading and get my kids the books they love to read too even if its at bedtime i want to be able to read when ever so i reordered the newest one can hardly wait to get it into my hot little hands👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻😈☺️,dont buy this one buy the 119 one much better for your money 😊
4.0,giving the touchscreen display only four stars because amazon does not provide a book cover with a light you can buy a book cover but you have to buy a separate light which is cumbersome and really really sucks,really sucks
1.0,has no kindle users guide  im rather disappointed as i really wanted to learn more about using it,this user has no user guide to consult
1.0,i returned this i found the special offers confusing and there is no case option with a light which i really wanted,i returned this i found the special offers confusing

2.0,too dark shouldnt have ordered two,two stars
4.0,i didnt want my kindle firehd to get wrecked somehow when i go camping or to the pools with my children so i purchased this one to take along in its place it pretty basic but it serves its purpose and works well i would not recommend it as a gift,pretty basic but good

5.0,i already had a 1st generation kindle but i was having a problem now and then my wife surprised me with the kindle 6 for no reason i have used it exclusively since i got it and i love it next will be the kindle fire like she has,kindle 6 glare free
1.0,too light doesnt feel like a book,not heavy enough
5.0,this is a wonderful thing to have its very easy to use it holds lots of books and the battery lasts for a long time although i still like paper books i love my kindle and take i it with me everywhere i go im not bothered by the fact that it doesnt have an inbuilt light as the battery lasts longer this way and there are reading lights made specially for this i bought a cover provided with a reading light and im very happy with it,very nice
1.0,the touchpad is awful cant use it,touchpad does not work
5.0,love this item i received this as an early christmas present from my husband as he knows i love to read ive had it a couple weeks and it especially has been helpful in getting my daily time in reading the bible and having easy access to read is so nice because i for the last few years have been reading books on my pc for kindle i had a little learning curve with making sure to buy books that work with kindle as i got a sudoku one thinking itd let me play on touchscreen hah nope thats okay i returned that book lol thank you for this affordable and good quality device,great christmas gift
4.0,had some trouble downloading account,four stars

5.0,really like it and at a great price,great
5.0,i have not used this new kindle much yet because i have many books on my older kindle and i didnt see any sense in moving them i took advantage of a good deal just to have an extra one on hand it works fine and i do have some books to read on this new one,i took advantage of a good deal just to have an extra one on hand
1.0,i returned mine not what i expected,get a tablet instead
5.0,im loving the light weight and easy to hold nature of it even though i own an ipad a iphone and the first kindle fire i found that i needed to be able to read without light shining in my eyes and without glare it was priced affordably ive since enjoyed many hours of reading,sometime an all in one solution is not the solution you need
2.0,screen was too dark and hard to read,two stars
5.0,i absolutely love this reader i am still learning my way around but the touch screen is wonderful and easy to read i didnt want anything larger than my first kindle and i ordered the carrier as well its something i will enjoy for a long time i cant go further with my review because i still havent exploredor learned about all that the guide explains yet so until later i am in the middle of a new syfy book,this one is perfect forme
2.0,no back light for reading in the dark,two stars
5.0,i love the size it fits perfect in my pursei have two nooks and an ipad mini but i love the size of this very light and easy to carry aroundits great if you like to read outside,love it great for just reading
5.0,love this kindle super easy to use ,five stars
4.0,i was one of those people that promised myself to never buy one of these things but i had to acquire one to get affordable versions of my expensive college books now that i have one i wish that i had invested in them years ago i wouldve save so much on my college books alone not to mention my own personal library the only negative thing is have to say about this kindle is that you cant read in the dark and that seems a little rediculous sense this is essentially a small tablet and we already have that technology,good investment especially if youre in college
5.0,can i trade it in for a higher model,five stars
4.0,i like it but i have been spoiled with my paperwhite i cant go back this was my sisters occasionaly she bemoans the loss of her kindle 2 with no ads and 3g there really is no going back from 3g and no ads but you probably wont notice what you never had as this is the entry model,i like it but i have been spoiled with my paperwhite
5.0,couldnt be happier with this device,its worth every cent
1.0,it doesnt unlock everytime i leave it for a while even slide to unlock screen doesnt come back stuck on the lockscreen ad total reboot is the only way i can get in i tried factory reset no help,it doesnt unlock everytime i leave it for a while 
5.0,great replacement for my 3g keyboard,five stars
4.0,its fine i just liked my kindle w buttons better it is very difficult to get back to screen where you search etc after you have finished a book and i have yet to figure out if you can view archived items when i go to buy a bookthat i know i have already purchased it tells me i have already purchased it but does not have a place where i can view archived items that i can find like my kindle w buttons,kindle 6 glarefree touchscreen
4.0,it is an excellent piece of equipment except that when i bought it i did not realize that the light level is not adjustable,no backlight adjustment
2.0,i previously owned a kindle with buttons to change pages go to home page etc that i loved unfortunately when traveling something pushed into the screen and broke it and amazon doesnt fix the screens so i had to order this one i absolutely hate the touch screen it is way too sensitive so i end up jumping between pages randomly or highlightingpulling up the dictionary for random things if i hold it down for even a split second too long i also hate that i cant bring it to the pool or the beach because i try to put it in a plastic bag to protect it from the water and the plastic bag just constantly pushes against the screen and hits random features such as changing the text size and font highlighting passages and pulling up the dictionary it is impossible to read this way i really wish amazon would just come back out with the kindle version with buttonsnot everything needs to be touch screen,hate the touchscreen
5.0,i bought this to replace my original kindle which finally gave out i had some misgivings based on the lessthenfivestar reviews i read but couldnt be more pleased with my decision everything works and the screen is easy to read love my kindle,i had some misgivings based on the lessthenfivestar reviews i read but couldnt be more pleased with my decision
5.0,kindle is better that suppose inicially i use my ipad mini to read too and decide to try kindle it exceeded my expectetions,kindle is better that suppose inicially
3.0,not as easy to use as kindle hd fi re,three stars
5.0,this is my first ereader and it has really made me to get into reading again i find the screen to be easier on the eyes then the kindle android app or kindle fire which my wife has i dont read in bed so there is no need for a back light such as the paper white set up was quick and there isnt much of a learning curve if you have a smartphone you shouldnt have any issues operating the kindle for 59 i am very happy with kindle glare free and have already read a couple of novels on it,nice entry level ereader
3.0,good reading item needs back light,three stars
4.0,my wife is always reading so i grabbed her the kindle for the sake of time and convenience you wont find a better product for a better price how much did you spend i was asked not as much as you think i did dont get me wrong i love books the tangibility the smell yes i know the shelf that collects new works and old classics but when she cant fit a john sandford hardback in her purse she certainly can fit that kindle in that should sell the kindle itselfbuy with confidence its a great product what would make it better and 5 stars a backlight for those who read in bed,not bad not bad at all
3.0,not good sorry i gave up my old one,three stars
3.0,the feel of the unit is somewhat light and cheap it does what it is supposed to do by allowing you to read the ebooks but the processing power behind it feels a little slow some menus are slow to load slight lag in between screens,the feel of the unit is somewhat light and cheap 
1.0,took it back not worth the investment,one star
4.0,i bought this for my daughter and she didnt like it she already had kindle fire before but got broken so i bought this but she said that its ok to read but fire was easier to readbut she already has laptop and smartphone so for me she dont need any internet on kindle so i love the priceover all i loved the price so i give 4 star,good price
2.0,i thought i had order white screen,wrong item
5.0,so far i loveeeed it i used to haver the old paperwhite version and i loved the smaller size and touch screen the possibility of family sharing is also great since i can get the books i used to have in my old kindle in this new device i highly recommend,and i loved the smaller size and touch screen
2.0,i would not buy this again to small ,two stars
5.0,good piece of equipment not as substantial as the old kindle touch but the lighter weight makes for easy reading with one hand it is quite a bit easier to navigate and like the touch is immune to sunlight all in all a great deal,love it
5.0,taking some getting used to,five stars
3.0,i very much like the new einks contrast of background to text and the kindle unlimited to monitor my childrens reading i strongly dislike the fact i can not download productivity active content such as note pad memo tasks or a calendar i am a big user of such productivity apps so if all you want is to purely read than this is for you this did replace my old kindle touch which could download such productivity active contents,7th generation vs kindle touch
5.0,this product exceeds my expectations,wonderful product
5.0,probably the best thing i have ever bought for myself i love love love this reader i dont mind the special offers at all since they dont interfere with the books im reading while im in them if you love to read do yourself a favor and pick this up no regrets whatsoever ,best thing i have ever bought for myself
5.0,gift for granddaughter she loves it,five stars
3.0,okay i had one of the original kindles the first version of this one this one works okay but turning pages is more awkward however i bought for reading during down time at work and it does what i wanted,not great or close to it but it does what i bought it to do
5.0,i really have enjoyed this kindle its 6 and the words appear nice and big and bright for easy reading inside or out this is my first kindle but for the price i dont think have made a better choice it would be a great device for a child that enjoys reading and its simple to work,great device for the price

2.0,no screen lightworthless to me,two stars
2.0,i prefer the ease of navigation on my ipad vs the kindle i wanted to take for travel books and found it a challenge to flip around between the pages hated not having a good zoom function and prefer the color on my ipad it was not very touch sensitive eithermy mother loves her kindle for book reading so dont let me comments deter you best part is its ability to hold a charge its pretty incredible,hated not having a good zoom function and prefer the 
5.0,great present for my mom she love it,
4.0,its much lighter to carry in my purse than the fire hd 7 however the collections option is in need of an upgrade i had the keyboard model several years back and when a book was put in a collection it didnt appear anywhere except there on this model it still appears in books as well as the collection you filed it under this was a great option since not all books go into a collection it would much easier to organize your books andor collections once its moved to a collection it should no longer appear under books when i first started using this model it seemed a little difficult to turn the pages but ive since learned that if you tap the center of the screen it will turn to the next page,collections and books need upgrade
4.0,oh how i wish i had bought it ad free,ads are annoying buy it without
5.0,great little device a back light would be good now and then i was able to upload a number of pdf files or books they must be loaded into the documents folder on the kindle then they show on your book menu,great little device
5.0,i like work fine and is easy nto learn,five stars
5.0,i hesitated for a long time to buy a kindle as i love real books so when i finally took the plunge i was pleasantly surprised i love that my kindle is lightweight easy to carry and stores many books in a tiny space its nonglare screen makes outdoor viewing very easy and on windy days i can read hands free whilst eating lunch without having to worry about pages being turned it never loses my place i can bookmark passages easily and highlight text if needed if im reading the book on more than one device it will sync to the furtherest page read the device holds a charge for weeks the only drawback is the inability to read the screen in a darkened room for that i have a tablet and use the kindle app for android but i cannot read the tablet in broad daylight,love it
4.0,smaller than i thought but loving it,four stars
3.0,some of these did you read the description reviews are a bit harsh considering that many people drawn to a lowcost ereader may have never purchased one before and dont really know what to look for such was the case with my husband who got this for me for christmas i wanted an ereader so i could read a book without being interrupted by texts and other notifications popping up on my screen without having to mess with my phones settings every time i stopped and started reading and so i could read in bed without turning on a lamp or draining my phone battery having zero experience with designated ereaders my husband thought theyd all be like my daughters ipad or our phones lit this is not you can read from this kindle under the same conditions you can read from an actual book no reading without the bedside lamp so that in itself was a dealbreaker for me but some other impressions i had this thing is so lightweight i love that about it also the dictionary and character bio features are awesome i cant tell you how many times ill be reading a book and someone who disappeared in chapter 2 comes back in chapter 12 and i have to go flipping back to chapter 2 to remind myself who he is for the negative though coming from the kindle and nook apps for iphone i love their animated page turns you dont get that with a real kindle for video editors out there the effect is comparable to a onesecond crossdisolve its something id get used to but it felt strange at first but i never did get the hang of paging through my library sometimes it would lag sometimes it would flip perfectly other times i had to try to flip three or four times strange this device also has no kind of contrast control notquitepureblack type on a gray page is a little tough to read but you get what you get i do a lot of graphics work and the slightly bitmapped appearance of some of the larger imagesicons on the page bothered me a lot but im betting most people wouldnt notice or careso if you know what youre looking for and understand what youre getting here a simple ereader without any kind of backlightfrontlight whatever my guess is that youll be perfectly happy because thats what this is but if youve been using a kindle or nook app on a tablet or phone know that this is different it seems like the kindle paperwhite is more of what im looking for so ill try to convince the hubby to upgrade ,its is what it is which is nothing like the kindle app for your phone
3.0,gave it my mother and she is using it,three stars
5.0,this is my second kindle i love the smaller size and lighter weight the touch screen was easy to get used to my first kindle was over five years old this new one has many more features and conveniences,my second kindle

5.0,easy as the other side of he pillow,ah sum
5.0,great kindle for basic reading i dont use mine nearly as much as i used my fire hd but if you want a cheap kindle just for books this is it the eink screen allows this device to stay charged for weeks with tons and tons of use i have received about 3 weeks on a single charge with hours a day of usage amazing battery lifea few things to keep in mind 1 this is an entry level kindle so there is no backlight i knew this before hand but have read a few reviews where people ding it for that reason 2 unlike older entry level kindles this one does have a touchscreen which makes it much much easier to use the touchscreen alone is worth the upgrade if you have owned a kindle in the pastone of the keys i love about this kindle is there are no notifications like my fire hd ill be reading on my fire hd and get an email notification and stop reading to check it usually knowing it isnt important its just something people do now days so no push notifications on this device is greatthere are tons of reviews here on amazon but my review hits the keys that mean a lot to me hopefully other readers will feel the same when reading this review if you would like me to review or answer something else about this kindle feel free to ask in the comment ,great basic kindle
5.0,i love this it is my 4th kindle and i purchased it simply for travel dr visits all those things that you hurry up and go to then sit and waitit is well worth the cost i have a kindle fire as well that i love my original kindle has the page turn buttons on the side i love both and use both this is actually much more simple and easy to use for me one handed riding a bikebut i still love my old one as well i dont like carrying my kindle fire every where i go this was an inexpensive way to have something small and lightweight always with me in my purse so i can read whenever i have that few extra moments it sets up quickly with no problems easy to use instructions walk you step by step very happy wth this purchase,my 4th kindle and i simply love it

1.0,glitchy and battery does not last long,one star
4.0,spend the extra money for the paperwhite i have the paperwhite and love it i bought this one for my husband because he hunts and reads in the tree stand no need for light when hunting right well at home at night he has to read with the light on or if im sleeping he will wear one of those head lamps weve purchased several ereader lights to attach and none of them work well,i have the paperwhite and love it i bought this one for my husband

3.0,meh its lightweight and small feels a bit chintzy i would probably have to wear readers to get more words on the page which i dont care to do so it will be lots of flipping hoping it will all be worth it when im reading a good book on the beach,hoping it will all be worth it when im reading a good book on the

4.0,works great no back light is the best,four stars
4.0,the kindle itself is flawless its light of weight but to the point of feeling cheaply made seemed to work very well however i thought when i bought it that id be able to find a cover with a built in light so i could read the thing in the dark i had a great case with a built in light for my kindle touch amazingly there is no cover with a built in light anywhere i could have bought a little clip on light but my fear was that it would snag on something and make me drop the kindle plus they just look shabby and klutzyultimately i returned the kindle and upgraded to the paperwhite which has a built in light read my review for that device on its review site,lacks accessories
4.0,just got first bookit is easy to use,it is easy to use
2.0,the screen is too sensitive every time i touch any part of the the screen lightly by accident all sorts of windows pop up i like the first kindle better also the edge is very thin and its hard to hold it without getting a hand cramp,i like the first kindle better
3.0,not as user friendly as the old style,three stars
2.0,this e reader is a pain in my ass its too sensitive i cant even put the device down without pages being accidently forwarded and losing my place or having the text change size on me navigating it is not as easy as the nook either i prefer the nook,navigating it is not as easy as the nook either
3.0,i can read books and order books off of amazoncom but it wasnt what i expected cant get emails or facebook on this device o,wasnt what i expected

1.0,so disappointed in quality i have the fire hd and got this for my son im now replacing this kindle purchase with a paperwhite,missed the mark
5.0,i love my new ereader i have a nook but it is old and does not want to turn the page like it use to the nook was really driving me crazy and this was such a good deal i could not pass it up they had it for 4900 around christmas time so why not saved some money and my sanity,five stars
5.0,awesome device for reading easy to use,five stars
1.0,the package came with a tight plastic wrap around it that was full of dirt or sand its really kinda gross how am i supposed to wrap this up and give it to someone i cant belive someone actually shipped this crap to me it looks like they dug it up out of a sand box its too close to christmas to exchange,full of dirt or sand
4.0,the touch screen is a real step up on the older kindle i had im loving it wish i bought the one with backlighting though ive become a fan of a dedicated device that doesnt get email internet just for reading,handy love this device
5.0,great ereader simple to use and nice,great ereader simple to use and nice
1.0,i own a paperweight and firehd and have very pleased but this device is sorry no brightness adjustment means eye strain and headaches,do not buy this
1.0,the kindle did not come with instructions and since i am new to touch screen technology i am having a very hard time with this product,did not like
1.0,not happy with readerdifficult to use,one star
4.0,this is my first ereader i avoided the purchase for a long time due to the lighted screens i have a significant problem with the led screens and other bright screens giving me headaches i need to adjust the brightness and limit my screen time to avoid migraines and when reading a book i dont want to be limited to such a short period of time the fact that this ereader does not have a lighted screen is perfect for me the touchscreen is easy to use i am still getting the hang of how to maneuver from one feature to the next as the organization is different than other devices ive owned but i am sure it will get easier with use,the screen is not lit yay
2.0,need lots of light in order to read it,two stars
5.0,very light and small for the price and use i love it originally bought to take internationally because i didnt want to lose something i spent over 1000 on the ease of use and simplicity is what i wanted and the battery lasts forever,perfect reader
2.0,no light id s problem need to upgrade,two stars
5.0,i had a nook before then it froze – can’t fix it then i decide to buy a kindle this time i am impressed with the high quality if this product the fact that it is “special offer” does not make any difference the “special offers” do not interfere with the reading because when you read the kindle does not show any offers also the offering “pages” are nice  it displays in the kindle some attractive pictures that works well as wallpaper i did not want the “backlight” version because i have an ipad and the backlight experience impacts on your image during your reading no matter what they say it does this kindle is perfect it is much lighter than my old nook and the letters are bold and easy in your eyes i highly recommend it – also get the one with the special offer it is kind of nice like i said it does not interfere with the reading plus you save money,also the offering “pages” are nice it displays in the kindle some attractive pictures 
2.0,great outdoors not so great indoors ,great outdoors not so great indoors
5.0,this latest version represents a significant upgrade from my previous and quite satisfactory kindle keyboard i have several modes of kindle reading including ipad and iphone yet this basic kindle has inherent advantages among these are sheer simplicity ease of reading in even the brightest of lighting think beach and as with a book itself the ability to get away from it all without having this basic kindle ring buzz or otherwise interrupt you for any thousand of reasons i might note also that the kindle whispersync seamlessly and perfectly works among all you devices thunt,excellent product
3.0,wish we had gotten a different version,three stars
5.0,i am in love with my kindle basic and just for reading which is all i wanted i didnt want a tablet because i felt i would play games and get on the internet so this is exactly what i wanted ive had it for a few weeks and havent charged it since i got it and i read at least 3 hours a day i bought the 7999 one with the advertisements and i actually really like it i found my book light and cover via those advertisements also love that you can go on goodreads and get a free trial of kindle unlimited which i will keep after th trial is over overall its the best buy ive made in a long time,best buy ever
5.0,cant sleep without this little machine,five stars
3.0,this is my first kindle im not overly impressed with it i tried the paperwhite first but the light even when turned all the way down was giving me migraines whenever i read on it i then bought this kindle and i still get slight headaches reading on it im very surprised this has 167 ppi i have a first generation 2010 nook that has the same 167 ppi i would have thought after 4 years the ppi would be better the nooks have continued to be upgraded with each new release while this basic kindle version doesnt im really not fond of the touch screen either i would prefer actual page turning buttons the power on button at the bottom is weird i can already imagine all the crumbs and dirt that will be stuck in the button from being in my purse the power on button should be at the top the very plastic edge and back have no grippers or anything to hold on to it with if you buy it without a case to try it out it is a little slippery and i actually dropped it a few times because it slipped out of my hands once in a case its fine i also think the background color is too dark my 2010 nook is still the better of the two to read on,my first kindle not impressed 
3.0,great gift wish it was backlit though,three stars
5.0,so light and cute i love it who needs a light its like a real book i just use it like a real book only its super super light to hold in one hand its also better for using before bed because backlit readers interfere with sleep,so light love it
5.0,easy to use easy to navigate i can read for hours without hurting my eyes just like a real book i work at a survey call center so i spend a lot of time waiting for the computer to find a number to call or for people to actually pick up their phones and my kindle has been my constant companion ever since my dad bought it for me a couple weeks ago the battery life feels like it goes on forever it does exactly what it is made to do and does it well buying books is extremely simple and the family library my dad set up works perfectly on it the size is perfect too it fits nicely into the small pocket on my backpack but it isnt too small to be comfortable for reading on i havent found anything i dislike about it yet my dad opted for the version with ads when the screen is locked but i barely even notice they are there i would recommend this tablet to anyone looking for a way to read ebooks without having to stare at an lcd screen although everyone should be aware it doesnt do much else this is an ebookreading device not an android tablet it does not do apps or anything fancy like that but my phone and laptop already do all of those things for me it is basically like having your personal library in your pocket allinall it is perfect for what it is,easy to use
5.0,does the job for just reading perfectly needed a paper white kindle for outdoor use and didnt want to spend big bucks the ads arent bothersome as they are just there on your main screen like a screensaver and go away as soon as you swipe to wake up the kindle not sure why you would pay more to not have ads just recently started taking advantage of the book loan feature that a true kindle is required to access with prime doesnt work with the app only that alone will pay for this kindle and the prime membership in a short period of time,does the job
3.0,i go everywhere with kindle and the old kindle had just died so a friend bought this one for my birthday for the first three days i sooooo loved it but than the thing wont turn on wont do a thing i had to wait til the next day to get to a computer to find out how to fix this issue when they send out this unit it should have a trouble shoot book sheet in with it because i have heard from a few people that this is a common issue,loved it but than the thing wont turn on

5.0,nice,five stars
4.0,the intro level kindle does not have a lot of bells and whistles however it performs its primary function very well it is a great ereader which is simple and easy to use it is much easier on my eyes than a tablet and makes reading especially at night very enjoyable,great ereader
4.0,smaller than expected but very practical,four stars

2.0,difficult to read on due to no lighting,two stars
5.0,as always this is a great little kindle you can read it outside in the sun and inside but not in the dark as long as you have an addon light no problem if you are new to kindles this is a great way to start this unit is a replacement for one that was lost right here on the place and we never could find itanother mystery,great little kindle

5.0,very nice unit much easier to read than my previous 1st generation released unit i also like the new format for books all previous books transferred over seamlessly did have a problem signing on to wifi and kindle help was no help however i would recommend purchasing this kindle,very nice unit much easier to read than my previous 
5.0,i dont know why it took me so long to switch from books to a kindle i had tried reading on my note but the glare made it not so enjoyable i love love love my new kindle it really feels like a book in your hands,i love love love my new kindle
3.0,i find it difficult to activate the menu bar at the top you need a tiny finger to activate the menu ribbon instead of the dictionary feature also the free every word game i had on my previous 4 now broken kindles i am careless has disappeared i loved that game otherwise it is a nice readable screen,for tiny fingers only
4.0,i actually enjoy reading with this kindle although i will admit i was prejudiced against it because i enjoy actual books that said my main complaint is how difficult it is to really move around in some books the pc versions of kindle are much more user friendly nevertheless i recommend it for the dictionary feature and it is just fun to use and so small yet legible and convenient i bought it during black friday sales so the 4900 price cant be beat,i actually enjoy reading with this kindle
3.0,the lack of backlighting makes it limited,three stars
2.0,i returned this item for a full refund,two stars
5.0,first ereader that ive had i love it,five stars

5.0,this is the most basic kindle i could buy i wanted something lowpriced that i could take to the beach i prefer to read printed and bound books but you cant beat an ereader when you travel this does exactly what it promises to do,perfect for beach reading
5.0,got it as a giftso surprised love it,best gift ever
4.0,i love my kindle for reading its so easy to take to work with mevery lightweight so much better than bookcases full of onceread books gathering dust i do wish it was backlit so that i wouldnt need to turn a lamp on to read after dark and it can be a little hypersensitive when turning a page or not but it cant be beat for the price i paid thats for sure,love it
5.0,very lightweight and comfortable to hold,five stars
3.0,if i lay this kindle down on its face it changes its type size and changes pages definitely not crazy about this but i bought it to use while on cruises and in the sun it works for that purpose,get a better one that this option
5.0,very clear display lots of font options,very happy with kindle app
3.0,good deal for me at 3900 although my wife prefers the fire because of the more brightly lit screen this is good enough for me to read my technical books and bible and dictionary and the battery lasts longer than the fire i would buy it again,good enough for me

5.0,excellent ereader i saw a woman on the bus using this product i came home went on amazon website found the ereader with the paper white and have been pleased a musthave if you like any kind of reading material,excellent ereader i saw a woman on the bus 
5.0,exactly what i waned for a second kindle,five stars
4.0,a little slow and plastic cheap feeling but light and small battery life outstanding the device is a bit slow seeming yet otherwise fine kindle search is just getting more confusing every year with my prime and my unlimited trial utter shock how limited the unlimited selections are in science fiction for example but i got this on sale for 60 i got what i paid for definitely,its a fine cheap ereader
2.0,i have one of the original kindles and have loved it from day 1 i have purchased various kindles for other family members and everyone agrees that they are the best i decided to purchase a newer kindle for my husband and myself because the battery on our old models must be plugged in almost every night i was attracted to this new model because of the longer battery life and the smaller size unfortunately we all have certain games we love to play on our reading devices in addition to reading great books i was not aware that this could not be done on this kindle if i had known i would have never purchased these devices i use my new one for reading only its great for that and then switch back to my older kindle to play the brain games my husband who is an avid card player refuses to use his new one and is still only using the old one i had already loaded my books over so i am sure amazon would not accept a return at this point ,i have one of the original kindles and have loved it from day 1
4.0,girlfriend loves it because it is not heavy and can carry it in her purse when she travelsthe only bad thing she found on this was that it has no lighting so it is hard to read in dark places,the only bad thing she found on this was that it has

5.0,nd took tie to ask questions thank you,nd took ti e to ask questions thank 
3.0,it is ok however one has to search for the book each time to findit not easy to use and rather difficult to read in dim light should have spent the extra on the back lit model better on my ipad,not worth it
5.0,works great nice screen very light kindle,use
5.0,this is a nice way to read a book it is the first time i have tried kindle and the first book an anthology only cost 099 the screen is clear and i can adjust the font size to suit my old eyes changing pages by touch is a snap so far i have found no negatives,this is a nice way to read a book
1.0,was not as good as i thought sent it back,one star
5.0,the only reason i got this kindle was because my dear wife destroyed my first generation kindle that i have enjoyed thoroughly i was afraid of upgrading due to the fear i had of newer kindles not standing up to the first the touch screen can be tricky sometimes but the display is as crisp as ever take a bow amazon,1st gen rest in pieces
5.0,exactly what i expected when i ordered it,five stars
5.0,i’ve owned an ipad for several years actually i’ve owned two ipads 1st ipad ipad2 i’ve loved and hated the ipads i love the battery life and semi portability of them besides my 6 year old playing games on it i spent 974375 of the time reading on the kindle app yet outside in sunlight ipads are useless forget taking an ipad outside and relaxing on a porch or parkso for my birthday my wife bought me an 99 plain jane kindle it is incredible the electronic ink technology is amazing after using glaring screen of an ipad and other tablets cuts down on blue light usage at night which allows me more easily fall asleep i already had a decent collection of books because i’m a amazon prime member it allows me to borrow books from kindle owner’s lending library which should pay for the actually kindle within a year it’s light and easy to carry my bibles on the kindle to church ipad was always a little inconvenient kindle with an omoton smart case can easily slip in my pants pocket sermonssong lyrics can be stored on kindle for easy access for spurofthemoment moments  it’s easier to lay down on a podium and see from any angle without an obvious “glow” others around you are less likely to be distracted by an “electronic device” being usedbookmarks notes search features allows me to easily replace ipad for speech giving and church usage not even considering the huge price difference between an ipad and basic kindle i would consider readers and laptop owners to try a kindle ereader i recommend for preachers musicians and book lovers alikei learn more with the kindles built in dictionary wikipedia xray and search features very happy with my gift,i’ve loved and hated the ipads
5.0,amazing the best gadget ive ever bought,five stars
4.0,my new touchscreen kindle is great it is easy to use being similar to my older kindle i like being able to change the font and the font size of letters the one problem i have is it is almost too sensitive i gently tap it to turn the page a feature i like very much but if im not careful the kindle will turn several pages instead of one also i get the dictionary sometimes when i mean to turn the page i do like the dictionary feature however the kindle is a so fun to use all these books at my fingertips and i can get a new one in seconds love it,my new touchscreen kindle is great it is easy to use

5.0,i just got my new kindle i have managed to kneel on and destroy some other way two other kindles so i havent had one for a while i bought this one with three years of protectioni love the touch screen the on screen touchpad works very well navigating is not clear yet but looks like it will be way easier than with the older kindle ive been using my laptop to read kindle books but it was way to big and uncomfortablei am learning spanish i loved that i could look up spanish words as i read i did not have that capability on the laptop that will be a big plus it looks like there was a spanish to english dictionary provided with the kindle also as well as several other languages i already had dictionaries on my cloud but ill be able to compare definitions nowi am quite happy,im so happy to have my new kindle
1.0,very disappointing screen is too grey to read printed words with no brightness adjustment better off buying real kindle,waste of money
5.0,i looove my kindle got it on sale for 60 so far it has mostly been an anne of green gables machine but i have also read more free marginally awful mysteries from the kindle store than i care to remember its to books what the ipod was to music…you never stopped loving reading but the kindle makes it really fun againtechnical details reads just like a book never have to worry about glare i have found myself wishing i had purchased the paperwhite just because i want to read in the dark and this kindle doesnt come with a light but ultimately its not a huge deal for me maybe ill upgrade in a few years,love it

4.0,very easy to hold lightweight just as promised seems a little sluggish when using download function though not when using cloud battery charges quickly and holds charge as promised nice in the car at night bright enough for me to read but not so bright that it distracts the driver only drawback is that on the homepage and on kindle instruction manual the screen flickers alternating between light background with dark words figures then dark background with light words figures not a huge issue but does interrupt the flow of reading and then leaves me with the same visual experience i used to have when i looked too directly at a camera flashbulb i have only used the kindle app on my laptop prior to this purchase and am very pleased with ease of use and portability of the actual kindle,very easy to hold
2.0,wasnt exactly what i wanted but it will do,wasnt expected
4.0,amazon does have the best e readers in my opinion but i would think that even the most basic would have a backlight to read at night i find that its inconvenient to have to have a lamp on or have to buy another e reader just to get some light other than that its pretty good if you just want to read and have your books stored in one place,amazon does have the best e readers in my opinion but i would think

3.0,i love my kindle this my third one and i hate that they got rid of the buttons my hair changes the page and you have to do funky things with your fingers to get simple changes like font and the home screen,third kindle and i like the older ones better
2.0,this review is not about the kindle version 2 it is about getting the dang thing to start up after it is running it is fineso you ask what is the problem the problem is that it does not charge out of the box with the original softwareand two out of the three techs i spoke to were not aware of the need to update the software to get it to accept a chargereally unbelievablea lot i mean a lot of time with tech support until finally i met the dude who knew that the software update was essentialso the questions are why does amazon ship the thing with software which does not accept a charge and why does amazonnot inform the techs that a software update is essential to get the second generation kindlle to accept a chargethat is what i would like to knowi rest my case,trouble with version two
3.0,didnt realize this was not a lighted displayreturned it amazon charged me 3 for shipping im fine with that i can take some responsibility for not reading more thoroughly i just assumed it was a lighted display,good device but display is not lighted

4.0,i got this kindle 6 for my birthday i think that it would make a good present for everyone else that may be having a birthday since i got this kindle the battery has never gotten below half gone the wire is 3 ft and 2 in long the kindle has a kindle store where you can buy or get for free books the kindle has wifi and can download at speeds under 1 minute the kindle has a 6 glare free touch screen without any buttons on the bottom this is noce because when you hold your kindle there is not a bunch of rounded buttons on the bottom the kindle has 4 gbs of storage and that can hold a lot of books it is not a color screen but is a black and white not glowing in the the dark enables it to have a long battery life,a whole new way to read
5.0,i have used a kindle reader app for my pc for a long time but i have never owned a kindle reader before i love this reader i can make the font as big as i want which is great as i get older i also love that i can highlight a word or words and get a definition or explanation in the context of the book highlighting is easy the fact that it is not backlit is not a problem as the text is very easy to read even in below average light conditions the unit is light and easy to hold on a plane or on a deck chair i bought an anker cradle for reading at my desk at home as it is just easier to not have to hold at my desk it is also great that the battery lasts about 2 weeks on a single charge,my first kindle but now im hooked
2.0,i cant believe i cant read it in the dark without an addon light now i have to fiddle with an attachment brings back memories of the 80s reading a paperback in the car we can put a rover on mars but no backlight time to replace some engineers,i cant believe i cant read it in the dark

5.0,love the size and the touch to turn the page,easier to hold than a book
4.0,compared to the kindle fire this is much easier to read on i got it for a special price so i really cant complain im definitely happy with my purchase however i wish i had held out for the paper white i didnt think the light would make much of a difference but it would be impossible to read on the kindle without a light on since i mostly read at night i think the paper white would have been a better fit,no frills but definitely a great reader
3.0,some reason thought i could read with no light,three stars
5.0,i bought this for my daughter she loves to read she enjoys having the book in hand but enjoys the convenience kindle brings when traveling buying books is easy and the print on the screen is good very good product good price,for the love of reading
5.0,good and cheap besides being the best to read,five stars
3.0,due to the size and the functionality its not that easy to use i have a several year old kindle fire that i really liked but the glare was frustrating i wish i had gotten a larger size the 6 hardly fits much on a page although it is certainly compactfunctionality is a little clunky and not as easyintuitive to use as id expect,a little awkward
3.0,need a small back light for night time reading,three stars

3.0,still waiting for 2000 promo after trade in,three stars
5.0,i purchased this as a replacement for the kindle i got three years ago my buttons where starting to go out and i was happy to have a reason to upgrade the only think that was disappointing is that my old kindle had free word games i really liked playing but on the new kindle i cant play them so for that i would have gaven 4 stars butall the new features make up for that so it gets 5 stars i love the xray with the books its really interesting how i can learn about the characters and places i also enjoy good reads being on there to see updates my shelves and reviews the touch screen responds very well can be a tad slow but remembering that its not an lcd screen it responds better than i imagined it would it is a perfect replacement for my previous kindle and i enjoy all the small details that make it better,perfect replacement
3.0,does not feel substantial too much plastic,three stars
5.0,i got it to my 13 years old son he loves it,five stars
5.0,bought it for my son was comparing with fire hd 7 8gbend resultkindle is pure for readers to read it is simulating actual book by making sure reads under enough lights with the technology it has its background and words look very much like actual bookfire hd having kindle app just like ipad airipad mini or other tablets its a tablet originally thought it will have option to turn itself to kindle when selected but obviously not i have decided to return fire hd 7btw i got kindle for 49 on prime day 79 for fire hd 7 8gb versionthanks to amazon,kindle 6 beats fire hd 7
5.0,the kindle 6 glarefree touchscreen is great it truly is glarefree my favorite thing about it though is the battery life ive had it for a month and its almost ready for a recharge i wish all my electronics had batteries that lasted that long i love to read and my kindle is light fits in my purse goes anywhere and i dont have to drag a charger with me,go anywhere reader
5.0,i like this kindle but i am thinking of upgrading to the backlight version and passing this one onto my son a little backstory i like to read and i bought a phablet last year so i could use my cell to read during lunch my current job does not allow cellphones or any cameravideo device of any type in the office so i purchased a kindle while i like the concept of the kindle i find that i miss the color screen of my phablet also i realized that i tend to read a lot a night and not having a backlight requires me to switch between my phone and the kindlein essence the kindle does what i needed it to do but i think the backlightcolor screen would be better for my use,nice kindlejust not sure it is for me
2.0,prefer my old one with whispernet and a keyboard,two stars
4.0,its pretty much everything i wanted in an ereader my only complaint is that a slightly sharper screen would be nice if you look really closely you can see some jagged edges to text but once youre holding it at a normal reading distance everything looks fine the battery life is insane i went almost a month having read two and a half books before it needed recharging the amount of storage is overkill i definitely do not need that much space as i typically read just one book at a time but if you want to carry a library around with you you can a definite must accessory for this is a case that can serve as a stand and most importantly hold it up vertically not horizontally borrowing books from my library is pretty easy i just hate the short checkout period transferring books from my pc to the kindle took a little figuring out but in the end it was a cinch using the free program calibre oh two other features i love is the quick ability to look up words and then how that word is added to a list of words id previously looked up that i can then study via flash cards to learn very cool i do not regret not buying the version without the backlight i always read next to a lamp and it looks great in natural daylight too,love it no going back to clunky books
1.0,do not like it at all the menu was no help when i was trying to find my books i am very unhappy with this kindle the directions are too hard to understand and follow,kindle 6 not user friendly
5.0,i love my kindle this is my third one i previously owned one with a full keyboard and then another special features one i really enjoy the touchscreen and new features included on this model i am very glad i upgraded and use this product quite frequently also i bought it on black friday so it was a very good price,very happy about this model
1.0,not user friendly,one star
5.0,does everything it is expected to small lightweight battery lasts a long timeread the description and youll not go wrongthe special offers are simply books shown on the sleep screen does not mess with the reading experienceonly runs mobi files cleanly no epub and pdfs cannot be easily zoomed etc again this is info easy to look up on the web but worth consideringall in all dirt cheap ereader good stuff,does everything it is expected to small lightweight battery lasts a long time
2.0,need more info included about how to use product,two stars
5.0,having never had a kindle i have to say i am impressed i had toyed around with some of the older versions with buttons but i have to say that this version is how it was meant to be its like something out of the future ads and all its even more minimalistic than your given idevice as there is only one physical button an thats on the bottom edge of the device the face is just screen and handling area and i think thats just what it should bereading is wonderful on it the letters are amazingly sharp it reads like a book well in my opinion better since you dont have to deal with a device that you need to hold open to readbefore purchasing i agonized for a while over the special offers im a heavy user of adblockers and i cant stand most advertising honestly the ads on the device dont bother me i was quite surprised theres a small banner at the bottom but that only shows when in the menus not when actually reading which would be abhorrent the lock screen is a full screen ad but the alternative is just a simple lock screen image so whatever it doesnt get in the way of anything physically or mentallyi got a refurbished model but the device was just like new maybe it didnt have some extra packaging goodies but im not missing out here im already enjoying reading some arthur c clarke on the device and it works great,i now prefer this to books
4.0,it is nice and for the price it was a good deal,four stars

5.0,perfect basic kindle we bought 3 one for each of my sons 8 10 and 15 ive had a kindle since they first came out and love it they have so many books laying around we thought maybe its time to move to a kindle since it takes up less space we travel in the summer in an rv so these will be perfect no more packing six or seven books and lugging them around the country just one kindle with thousands of books to choose from so far they have gotten the hang of it they love seeing the percent theyre on while theyre reading ive shown the how to look up words and highlight things they love them weve already traveled six hours to visit family and theyve been reading non stop in the car and before they go to bed perfect christmas gift,perfect basic kindle

4.0,my sister gifted me a kindle about a year ago and it has changed my life quite drastically im the kind of person who enjoys watching tv and movie adaptations of stories rather than reading books but after getting a kindle ive been reading about 5 novels every single month and the experience is just amazing recently i read the fault in our stars and watched the movie too and i could easily relate to why people keep bashing on adaptations anyway coming back to the device i really love how portable and lightweight it is unlike my smartphone its battery lasts literally forever and i have to hardly ever charge it the only thing i dont really like it is how it responds to every single kind of touch its sometimes really frustrating when youre in the middle of a story and the font changes,kinda a life changer p
5.0,love the touch screen wireless very easy to use,love my kindle
5.0,just as advertised my daughter loves it it is the next best thing to a real book the advertising on it for a 20 savings is no big deal it only is on the screen when you first turn on the kindle if it really bothers you you can always pay the 20 later on to have it removed the books that i already had in my kindle account for my ipad show up on the kindle this was a pleasant surprise thank you amazon,next best thing to a real book
5.0,love my 3rd kindle wish it had a built in light,five stars

3.0,wish id gone for a better kindle i find the gray screen a bit hard to read by would be nicer if it were a paperwhite but it works ok and if you can handle a light gray background rather than white it will do the job of an ereader,wish id gone for a better kindle i find the gray screen a bit 
3.0,screen is too dark in a dimly lit room at night,three stars
3.0,the print on my kindle keyboard has started to fade i tried several times to get an answer from amazon as to why this was happening but unfortunately no one has been able to help me i made all the recent updates thinking that might help but it has not i decided that before all the print fades i would purchase a new one i saw the recent deal of 3000 off kindle ereaders so i purchased the kindle 6 glarefree touchscreen it is okay i am not really thrilled with it but the price was good maybe i just have to get used to it i love my kindle keyboard i will keep using it until the last letter fades wish they still offered that one,the price was good maybe i just have to get used to

5.0,i just love the way this kindle reads it doesnt hurt my eyes or make me squint in bright sunlight like my other devices it has so many functions i got this as a dedicatedereader because i was having so many eye problems from the glare when i would read for long periods on my phone ir tablet an extra perk to the kindle is that the battery lasts for days at a time i can take it on a trip without worrying about taking an extra cord its just one of the best purchases i have ever made the only drawback is that there is no backlight for reading in the dark,great for eyes tired of squinting from the sun glaring on my phone

5.0,this ones my backup kindlei leave the other one in odd places and then cant find it so taking advantage of the constant updating so i can pick either one up and keep reading from where i left off,worth having a second for those who are scatterbrained
4.0,its a pretty basic product but i knew what i was getting i just wish the user interface os was better it seems way too rudimentary but as for fulfilling its intended purpose easy light reading wo the hassle of carrying physical books its superb especially if you live in metro area like nyc where you take the subway a lot,great for nyc subways
5.0,its a kindleits awesomeupdate sept 2015still love the kindle but would highly recommend getting the paperwhite model you will really want the backlight esp after you start using this more and more,five stars
5.0,when i saw this advertised one day for 4999 i thought id better get it put it away for a gift when i received it i decided to open it remembering my old keyboard kindle was getting old decided i need to keep it for myself what an amazing deal i love these things,99 i thought id better get it
3.0,i received a sealed package that did not include the instructions or manual either one of the handlers or the manufacturer forgot to include the manual very disappointed i have been purchasing from amazon heavily and never had this trouble since most reviews havent mentioned this with their purchases i suspect it had to be a handler i only found that a manual was included by watching a video on youtube you will need a manualalso if you are buying this as a gift for someone they pername you the purchaser in the kindle memory ,trouble with missing documents
1.0,i cant read in the dark i would like to send back,i would like to send
5.0,i love this product help to read more light weight lot of book available some problem with sentences layoutperfect to read as a book you need a light source to readim waiting to see if battery duration is okay but im afraid of less than 3 week 1 book more than 50 batteryit can be interesting to see the percent of battery on device,happy
3.0,i dislike that this doesnt have an auxiliary port,three stars
5.0,i have had a kindle fire for a while and have been pleased with it as a tablet but i really wanted a reader specifically they just have a better display for reading especially outside where the glare of the tablet makes it very difficult to read then the debate was regular kindle vs kindle paperwhite i read a ton of reviews on both and watched video reviews and asked people i knew who had them from what i gathered the primary difference is that the paperwhite has an internal light and the regular kindle doesnt oh and the paperwhite is 40 more amazon has an excellent return policy which ive used before and been happy with so i decide to save the 40 and go with the regular kindle knowing that if the lack of a light really bugged me i could return it and get the paperwhite well ive had it two weeks now and i can understand how the light would be useful but i am 100 pleased with my kindle it reads perfectly there are zero issues with the display ive read reviews with the paperwhite having spots in some cases or uneven light and it doesnt bother me in the slightest to read under a lamp i give the kindle 5 stars because it is exactly as marketed what you see is what you get no less no more it reads sooooooo much better than my fire and its lightweight and super easy to useif youre on the fence between a paperwhite and the regular kindle my advice is this if you regularly read in dim lighting not just dark but dim and dont have access to light to read by think about the paperwhite otherwise save the 40 and get the regular its awesome,for me regular kindle was the way to go
3.0,glare free but too dark to read without a light on,three stars
5.0,i enjoy this reader very much i have a tablet dont care for it cant read anywhere there is glare cant touch anything that it doesnt go elsewhere the paper white isnt anything like that i love it,i enjoy this reader very much

5.0,i love my kindle i love to read and this is easy to hold and the screen is easy on your eyes thanks for making reading fun againfor the longest time i struggled with reading i had a hard time keeping my place and holding a book was very uncomfortable for me it never felt natural i tried reading on my laptop but i look at a monitor for 8 hours a day it just tires your eyesthis ereader has helped me find a new love for reading i can not put it down sometimes and i seriously look forward to reading everyday books are great and i would never say this is better than a book but for those of you out there like myself those who have trouble reading a normal book out of discomfort this may be something worth trying,reading is fun again
3.0,i like that the ereader saves paper but i wish the page numbers were chronological rather than random and i havent figured out how to change the font the last time i went to read it was huge and there is no text on the menu at the top i wish the name were different reading should be enjoyable not something morbid,needs support
5.0,love that i can read in bright sunlight with this,five stars

4.0,this is a great product i read a lot and having it all in one device is fantastic i had a different ereader before this one and the screen on this is much nicer than the old one the only thing i dont like is it is not as comfortably to hold as my old one which had a rubber finish,fantastic device
1.0,i bough this for my 11 year old it worked quite well for a few months then it started freezing up i called customer service and was told that my warranty was about to expire but that if we still had problems with the kindle a week or two after the warranty period amazon would replace it well exactly a week after the end of the warranty we had the same problem i called customer service and explained to the lady what had happened i also repeated my previous conversation with customer service well she was absolutely no help all she did was try her best to sell me a new upgraded kindle i am very disappointed in amazon what a let down my 11 year old is quite frustrated and upset that she will not be getting any books for christmas,disappointed in amazon

4.0,solid ereader love the new touch screen i do wish amazon would have the same interfacemenu options across all of its devices in other words when you touch the screen on a kindle 6 touchscreen for the menu options it would be convenient to see the options in the same place and have the identical options as with the kindle fire hdx i also have a kindle fire hdx for the price the kindle 6 glarefee touchscreen display is well worth giving it a chance,the new kindle 6 glarefee touchscreen

2.0,it didnt say it wasnt backlit i didnt like that,i didnt like that
3.0,not as easy to switch between books as my original kindle and even though you only need to tap the screen to advance pages sometimes you have to tap a couple of times i also have to clean the screen more often to keep fingerprints off you have to know the exact location if you want to go ahead in the book as the table of contents doesnt show entirely,not as easy to switch between books as my original kindle and

2.0,i bought this for my dad hes 80 years old and his vision isnt as good as it used to be no light no power cordi saw the cord wasnt included but i could look past that a little anywaythis one is clunky and big too i didnt like it from the moment i took it out of the boxclunky and unreadable half the day its not even very good in lowlight conditions ironically my lamp causes a glare on the screen major disappointment amazon loses this sale,oh so very unimpressive
5.0,i love it it has replaced most of the books i read,i love it it has replaced most of the books 
5.0,extremely easy to use and to get started on the screen is very effective in all respects the books download very quickly the kindle is both large enough to make the screen perfect but small enough to carry in larger shirt pockets battery life is quite long and the capacity is immense,extremely easy to use and to get started on
3.0,not in love with this kindle i miss the old version,three stars
4.0,i love this kindle the battery is great screen is great its so much easier on your eyes than a backlit screen i was a little concerned with the size of the screen when i got it but i dont even notice it while i am reading so that worry is gone the only thing i really dont like is that you cant change the picture from an ad when you turn it off i remember thinking that one of the coolest features about the old kindles was that it would have fun pictures on the screen while it was off i really detest ads so that was quite the disappointment to me,great over all product
2.0,could not use for anything else but books wanted to be able to play everyword on it didnt realize it was only for reading books as a result it was returned to the store,could not use for anything else but books wanted 
5.0,this kindle is much nicer than the previous one i had although i really like my last kindle the new kindle is more compact easier to hold and the readability is better i did have trouble getting use to the touch screen and how the everything works but the how to book that comes with the kindle is very easy to follow since i had my previous kindle for over four years habits develop,better than before
2.0,not very comfortable using it too many mistakesdont understand a lot of it fire was much easier to set up for methink its because of having the two is making it confusing for me,not very comfortable using it
5.0,i love the 6 glarefree touchscreen kindle i owned my previous kindle for about 55 years and was happy with it unfortunately i dropped it and the inside screen fractured i had no idea how much of an improvement the touchscreen kindle would be the size is perfect and the home screen is so much easier to access the different features i would definitely recommend it,6 touchscreen kindle

3.0,as a ereader it is a great devicewhile it is not the white version it is super great it does not get my eyes tired like an lcd screen and it feel like having a real bookthe only thing i feel that the case is made of plastic it feels cheap at the touch my wife has another older one that has a rubbery feel to it dont different than this one it feels better in the handi like the weight it is super light,super great ereaderdont like the plastic case
4.0,giving to someone as a gift will update once opened,four stars
5.0,this is one of the best purchases ive ever made im an avid reader and i love the feel of holding a hard copy book in my hand and turning the pages as i read i am also in the habit of highlighting passages and making margin notes as i read nonfiction which was a big reason for me not having been open to the idea of an electronic book when i read the description of the kindle 6 glarefree touchscreen and saw that it has the highlight and note feature i became more receptive to the idea of an electronic book i chose the glarefree style after some debate because i thought about how difficult it is trying to read the screen of my smart phone outside i told myself i would just use the bedside lamp for night reading over the last couple of years i have gotten into the habit of googling topics on my phone in the dark before going to sleep usually not always i wake up the next morning with a terrible headache the first night i read from my new 6 glarefree kindle with the bedside lamp for light i kept thinking to myself this thing is so comfortable to holdeven lying down i really liked the fact that i could enlarge the font and not have to keep readjusting my glasses while lying on my side because i resized the font enough that i did not have to wear my glasses  the next morning when i woke up after having read for hours on the glarefree kindle my head did not hurt at all now when i read outside i dont have to find a shady spot nor do i have to hold the kindle in weird positions trying to see what is on the screen like i have to do when i try to read my phone screen outside another great thing i love about having many books on the kindle is that instead of dragging along a heavy tote bag full of books on trips i will be able to stick my kindle and my charger in my purse and will still be able to have a choice of what im in the mood to read im so glad i finally decided to try something new after fighting the idea of changing to this newtome way of reading books for so long,old habits die hard 
3.0,i dont think the screen is very bright hard to read,three stars
3.0,convenient size but screen is too sensitive to touch,three stars
5.0,kindle rocks its so lightweight and the pages look like real book pages i just connect a book light to the portfolio cover that i got for it and im all set for nightly reading in bed the battery really does last for weeks,just as good as the actual book
1.0,dont bother i bought the kindle with the ads and its impossible to navigate around them the kindle was slow to respond and when it did the screen was very dark and hard to read i never did figure out how to get to the amazon store to download games for my daughter and finally just gave up and returned the thing it was quite a disappointment from the kindle my daughter had a few years ago this one is cumbersome and a real pain,not worth your time or money
5.0,like g https and easy for reading even in bright light,five stars
4.0,finally gave in and got a kindle and i love it its better than a paper book in experience while reading and touring so many books around is nice ive barely scratched the surface but i already wish i would have gotten one sooner that said theres a grounding a nostalgia that only a premiere hardcover novel can bring tactile visual olfactory and a usefulness that only a paperback study book can bring note taking page marking kinetic mnemonics,great for eating up text but save a place for paper
2.0,still trying to get to understand and use it properly,two stars
3.0,three things are really annoying with this1 the power button is at the bottom and its really easy to hit it would it be so hard to put it at the top2 it doesnt turn all the way off3 it comes with a power cord but not a wall chargerhowever it does what it says it does its a no frills ereader and despite the annoying bits it is easy to use,three things are really annoying with this
5.0,didnt work out of the boxreturnedjunk,five stars
2.0,its a great reading device but something about highlighting causes it to become more and more sluggish until it freezes and im forced to restart the kindle sometimes itll go 10 highlights without freezing other times it will happen after 3 never had this problem with my older non touch kindle,sluggish performance after highlighting
5.0,as expected convenient to take with me wherever i go,five stars
5.0,i have no problem with my eyes when i use this kindle i love my kindle fire but i cannot read it for hours at a time the paperwhite is really just like reading a book but easier to hold and carry around best of all no buttons on the face to accidently push,the paperwhite is wonderful
1.0,for 7900 this was a huge disappointment i have the kindle fire and love it i dont recommend this and wish the company to remove it i gave my to the homeless in hopes that they may do something with it please remove this device it not worth the money and is not glare free sherry,00 this was a huge disappointment i have the kindle fire and love it
5.0,i love it i have 4 kindles each serves a different purpose the 6 is light it fits in my bag and goes with me everywhere it has a long battery life and so i am never disappointed when i am in a waiting room or parking lot or traffic jam it is easy to read and easy to turn pages i have to admit after i had read some of the reviews i was a little worried complaints about page turning and battery life and ability to read the page dont believe it i wanted something light and more portable than even my first kindle this lives up to the advertisements,i love it i have 4 kindles
5.0,love love love best purchase i have made in years,love
5.0,i love my new kindle small enough to hold in the hand and so easy to manipulate love being able to send text pdfs etc to my kindle address and be able to read them almost instantly on my reader i strongly recommend buying a touchscreen stylus it makes keeping the screen clear effortlessno smudgy fingerprints,i love my new kindle
2.0,surprised there is no light should have not assumed,two stars
4.0,first kindle i have ever owned just started loading books from amazon not yet comfortable with it i have always preferred a book rather than an electronic item but since there are so many books that only go to kindle had to try so far so good,not yet comfortable with it

5.0,met and passed all my expectations this is my third kindle and all still work just great my original keyboard changed my world my fire is always ready to entertain me the newest the 6 touchscreen is the lightest most portable of all always have touchscreen with me which means never any wasted time traffic jam no problem waiting for an appointment or friend quality time at a touch my sony stopped working after a couple of years my nook was dropped one too many times too endure my kindles just go on the book is dead long live the ebook,the new age of reading is here
2.0,not entirely happy with the new touchscreen though its easy to use when working properly it sticks a lot that is at some point while reading it wont turn the page i tap and tap the screen but instead it reverts to the kindle startup screen where i wait while the device refreshes itself when it returns to the homepage i have to open up the book again only to discover it cant remember the page i was on grrr may have to replace it,unrealiable touchscreen
5.0,my daughter requested a kindle so of course i got her oneshe simply loves it and gets total enjoyment each day i could not believe how reasonably priced they are so it makes a great gift,a xmas gift to my daughter
3.0,fine ereader long battery life and cant beat the black friday price i paid for it the ads are really obnoxious though and i am used to apple products so it feels very clumsy and much less intuitive but i really needed a light ereader and this fits the bill,fine ereader long battery life and cant beat the 
2.0,the kindle paperwhite i had was stolen and i decided to spend less money for this model its difficult to read unless im sitting under a lamp i recommend spending more for the paperwhite,go for the paperwhite
5.0,this device provides an accessibility to literature that is unprecedented love it i do wish i would have opted for the version with a built in backlight but i probably need more sleep anyway i also use it to store documents that i need to reference frequently even my classwork you just cannot beat the portability and the battery life,makes reading a joy

4.0,easy to read and light to hold visible in all light other than darkness wish there were paper instructions on operating this device because i didnt know how to activate it from off i pushed the power button but didnt have on reading glasses to see the small text at the bottom that said swipe screen to turn on,i like the touch screen now that i am used to it
5.0,good product and good price its perfect for reading,love it
4.0,im still getting familiar with the changes compared with my other kindle it is very touchy changes in a blink and am having trouble getting back to where i was but i like the non glare and am sure i will like it better once i get used to it its like having a new phone gotta work with it,changes in a blink and am having trouble getting back to where i was but i like the non glare and am sure i will like

4.0,im a late adopter to the ereader game i love my paperbacks and keep a nice little library at home im a barnes noble employee but never liked the feel of the nook after using my kindle for the past week i can honestly say im in love will it completely replace my library absolutely not however the ability to carry around currently 300 books on a screen that has 0 eye strain can be read in the same lighting as a paperback lasts for weeks at a single charge and is comfortable to read one handed i consider this an excellent purchase and im sure i would have jumped on this train earlier had i seen what i was missing,lovely from a technerd who cherishes print

2.0,i used to own a kindle with keyboard so like generations before and was pretty satisfied until one day screen stopped working and was like after couple of years i bought it so whatever i then bought this one and it was fine like the one before but without all the buttons now im giving 2 stars because i have two problems that really baffled me1 i bought a book from gumroad and they only provide pdf at the moment for that book fine i use calibre to generate a kindle friendly format sent it to my kindle account and started reading it there and boom kindle will just restart itself fine im using calibre my bad i then sent my pdf and started reading it and bam again restarting and not only that it would say kindle out of memory and restart2 i bought a kindle book directly from amazon reads fine and everything and today it occurred to me that i wanted to do a search on the book type type type hit search bang again restarting without saying anythingim really disappointed since both matters are something that my oldie kindle was able to handle and now i spent bucks in something newer thats really dissatisfying i dont think ill ever buy any kindle or suggest any of my friends to do it,kindle restarts on big pdf and searching throughout a book

2.0,its an ok product no option to change the brightness coming from smartphones speed is laggy and feels like a cheap product in hand i would rather get a 50 kindle fire tablet instead of this,not good
5.0,fantastic for what i use it for reading print is clear and i especially like the dictionary feature most of my reading is done while riding a recumbant bike but i will use this more and more as i exhaust my source of books,i like it
2.0,screen is too small not enough font sizes returned it,screen too small
5.0,just an awesome item i love that it doesnt hurt my eyes and its great to read in the car or anywhere else i definitely recommend getting a light for it that you can clip onto your case or otherwise,just an awesome item i love that it doesnt hurt my

3.0,wish it had a light traded it in for a samsung tablet,three stars
4.0,i am still fairly new to the use of it but steadily learning i would like to have a manual that clearly shows you how to use it so far it is trial and error there are directions on the screen but skipping back and forth between directions and actual use is confusing to me otherwise i like my kindle,i would like to have a manual that clearly shows you how 
3.0,should be in large writing does not have night light,three stars
5.0,i purchased this kindle when it went on sale for prime day i am so happy with this purchase it is durable easy to read and easy to connect to wifi and download books i love that i dont have to go to a bookstore to browse and pay bookstore prices my favorite thing about this kindle is that i can download samples before buying a book to make sure its something im even interested in,i am so happy with this purchase
5.0,like that its a touch screen my first kindle has the buttons on the bottom to navigate and that kinda drives me nuts i love the simplicity of this kindle no bells and whistles just good ole reading,like that its a touch screen
5.0,just getting use to it i like everything it has to offer especially the free books they have because i love to read this really comes in handy and for a great price that i got on thanksgiving no more buying hard cover books to read,i like everything it has to offer especially the free books 
5.0,i love my kindle i love to read but have arthritis in my shoulders and hands this made reading some of the heftier tomes that i enjoy a chore my kindle is lightweight small and holds hundreds of books when i go on vacation instead of packing several books to read i just slip my kindle into my purse and i am ready for some beach time some of the books i enjoy in hardcover are not available in large print with the kindle it is easy to adjust the size of the font and enjoy any and all books i would not trade my kindle for anything,i love my kindle
5.0,love reading from the kindle long lasting battery i have used my tablet with the kindle app but the real kindle lasts so much longer without a recharge of the battery convenient to take along wherever i go it holds lots of books and information very satisfied with this kindle,kindle touchscreen
5.0,had the original kindle and gave it as a gift happy that i just got this one light can hold in one hand great if all you want is an ereader downloads books at the blink of an eye no light but doesnt matter to me,love it
4.0,im glad i got it for a discount because if i had spent 70 on it i wouldnt be happy but the 30 i spent on it was well spent i took away one star because i dont think its worth 70 however i keep it with me all the time i read a lot more often than i did before i got a kindle,i love keeping it with me all the time
3.0,at various times i encounter a fairly long lag between the time i tap the screen and the page turns additionally there are times when it takes several more than 5 tries to get the page to turn frustrating this doesnt appear to be an anomaly my previous 6 inch model did the same also due to user error that im unaware of the screen often changes type size without any purposeful input on my end dont know what im doing wrong here owned three kindles nowliked the first generation best all that said i still enjoy reading from the kindle better than from a book,user error a problem for kindle owner
5.0,for something to read with its greati was surprised it didnt have the ability to access the intrnet the onboard manuel said you could but not true but i didnt buy it for that purpose so was not a problem but if you want to access the internet dont buy this model,wont acess the internet
4.0,i am pretty satisfied even though the unit is smaller than i expected fortunately the screen is the same size as my 2nd generation kindle i am still getting used to the features the biggest plus i can give is that the battery last longer,good replacement
5.0,i love my kindle so many books right in my back pocket,i love my kindle
1.0,amazon kindle customer support is as poor as the device we have had to buy 3 of these first one crapped out and amazon did what they should and replaced it second one failed partial frozen screen at 11 months when i enquired it got interesting because akindle support told me they couldnt help because i didnt have possession of the device it was with my child overseas i got it about a week and a half later and then they told me they wouldnt honor a replacement because in the intervening 10 days the device crossed the one year return window too bad for me then they changed their mind on that explanation and said the 12 month warranty period does not apply to products given because the first product was defective only to the first broken productthe amazon kindle algebra is apparently this simple 1 defective product 1 replacement defective product only 12 month original warranty the new maththey first offered me like 20 toward buying a new kindle ha i already had to buy a refurbed one to send overseas to swap with my kid so they would have one and i could get the broken one back so when i express my dismay about the support process they ask me to contact them again and i go thru the whole episode and they bump up the coupon offer to 30 i still dont need a fourth and lost 30 minutes ill never get back then they has the gall to send me a customer service email that says i understand that how inconvenient it must have been to borrow a free book and sign up each time where did that come from we have always had wonderful customer service for all other amazon products apart from the kindle stuff never again,amazon kindling might be a better name or use for this product
4.0,i am hookedi would enjoy a little backlight tho,i would enjoy a little backlight tho
5.0,  believe it or not this is the only other electronic device that ive purchased other than my laptop and cellphone and an investment im glad i made with a superlong battery life i only charge my kindle about once every 710 days i know that this device will last me for years to come its very easy to navigate and takes less than half an hour to charge five stars ,my first kindle  
3.0,my wife finds it more complicated than shed anticipated,three stars
2.0,it doesnt come with a light which is annoying although that information is not hidden the ads are annoying especially since it is a kindle for our 10yo and a lot of the ads are for semidirty romances you can pay extra to have those not appear but again annoying its an ok kindle but would definitely move up the line for a good one,meh
1.0,i was upset enough that there wasnt an option for a backlit kindle with buttons but knowing i dont have the option to buy any kindle with buttons now has me starting to regret investing in a digital library with amazon very disappointed,very disappointed
3.0,does not have a lite should have ordered the paperwhite,three stars
5.0,kindle is light weight and easy to read goes everywhere,five stars
5.0,my brother that i had to twist his arm to try loves it,nothing fancy it does its job though
2.0,did not like the fact that it was not backlithenry,two stars
4.0,this was a gift i like it but wish that it had a light,i like it but wish that it had a light
4.0,the kindle of this generation is glare free iam absolutly satisfied with purchasethe menu is easy to use the only down side is that the processor is a little slowthe weight is a breezelove it,iam absolutly satisfied with purchase
5.0,i used to be an ereader skeptic until i purchased this kindle as a christmas gift for myself because i dont have enough room to collect books like i normally have right at this point in time i wasnt expecting much just wanted to be able to read the books i would normally buy in paperback in a much more compact way ive fallen in love with this kindle though it takes priority over my cell phone even and i plan to be a kindle user for life probably because this is the best electronic device ive ever boughti have a brain condition that causes migraines on a semiconstant basis so reading off a kindle fire or some other tablet with a backlight was out of the question you need to buy a light to read with this kindle in the dark because it reads exactly like the pages of a book its amazing thats my favorite feature about the whole thing i also like that it has touch page turns buttons would probably make it too bulky its so sleek the way it isi have always had a dictionary handy in case i ever needed to look up a word with the kindle it has a built in dictionary inside of it you highlight by holding down the word and above it pops in a window with the definition its amazing honestly it also pulls up the wikipedia page for whatever word you highlighted even if youre reading a book you manually put on there because it wasnt available in the kindle storeanother amazing feature is the xray you highlight a characters name and it gives you a complete biography of them if you like those fantasyscifi books that come with maps at the beginnings and have tons of hard to pronounce character names you can keep them all straight because of the xray feature however this one only works if you get the book from the kindle storeone thing i dont like is that its so sensitive that if something brushes up against the top ie a cat the font will change sizes randomly and you always have to set it back to your preferred fonti dont know why people make such a fuss about special features i wouldnt pay extra not to have them because i hardly notice them at all i thought the kindle would be too small initially but its really a perfect size its bigger than a dollar store paperback i love how it shows you what percentage you are through of the bookfinally if youre poor but love books like me and you hoard used paperbacks dont be fooled into thinking youre spending less money on books this way because theyre digital theyre cheaper than a new hardback or even a new paperback but theyre not cheaper than a used paperback like i said i also did not have the room to keep hoarding them the way i was which also led me to purchase this kindle however i also think that it is worth paying a couple dollars extra on the digital kindle copy of the book versus the used paperback just for the kindles neat featuresall in all 5 stars this was my favorite gift of christmas by far i will use this for a very very long time,a lifelong christmas present
5.0,this is my wifes 4th kindle shes had evey edition she used this one on the cruise since the fire isnt easily visible in the sunlight,small light and visible in direct sun

5.0,i love my kindle it makes the reading experience amazing,amazon is the best
5.0,i had previously been using a samsung galaxy tablet for reading but it stopped working i went online to a book club i belong to and started asking for opinions as to what i should purchase i only needed a tablet i can read on i have a laptop and smart phone for internet games etc more than half the people there were at least 30 comments recommended this reader to me i made the decision to purchase and ive been using it ever since i got it i absolutely love it the only downside to the one i purchased is that theres not a built in light i knew this before i purchased but didnt think it would be a big deal its not but i kind of wish i had a light some times,reliable and easy to use
5.0,im satisfied with this itemfeel like an enhancement,splendid

5.0,i was anti ereader but my brother bought this for me as a gift i can not begin to tell you how much i love my kindle its so easy to use the screen is easy on the eyes no straining staring at a bright screen there is no light on this model you can order books direct from amazon or anywhere really i can check out books online from the local library and have them delivered to my kindle no trying to work around my librarys limited operating hours amazon also has tons of free books and with prime you can checkout read 1 book free per month,dont think about it just buy it
2.0,its okay i wanted something that would fit in my front pocket but thought i would try this just okay forgot one thing would love to do that me thing on amazon that did not result in having an ad shoved up my ass just once a nice little email that says thank you,two stars
5.0,i love my kindle but who doesnt amirightbut in all seriousness it doesnt hurt the eyes with glare i can read it in direct sunlight i feel like im cozying up to an old time book feels great and light get it,love it
2.0,i have gone back to my old regular kindle thats probably enough said it does show pages which is nice and i like the fact that i can hold down words and get definitions but i also like that my old kindle is simpler and i can delete books when im through reading and is just easier to operate,not much better it was a gift
5.0,i really like it so much better than holding a book of course i still love books they bring back memoriesregarding the kindle i have to get use to it pages move quickly if you fingers get touchy with the screenit is such a great way of having all these books at your fingertipsid been putting off getting it for years these special prices that you have offered made it so much moreprice able if any one likes to read this is the way to go jo hayden,i really like it so much better than holding a book
1.0,came defective waiting for replacement suppoort was awful,one star
5.0,perfect there are no words to describe how good this device is amazon did indeed a great job with this one i am a person that do not care about social networking or apps on a device i just care about reading it really meets all my needs no glare at all perfect resolution and the seamless download of any book is amazing the materials are of great quality and very simple yet refined design makes a must for avery passionate reader,perfect there are no words to describe how 
3.0,only because its harder to use kindle store to find books,three stars
3.0,kindle screen was flickering and ordered for replacement,three stars
3.0,i dont like it doesnt light up but i enjoy having it,three stars
5.0,i love my kindle it is very easy and comfortable to read on it reads just like a book absolutely no glare in the sun and it requires a light to read in the dark turning the page or finding a certain page is very easy it has an awesome feature where you can highlight a word and its definition will pop up it automatically takes all the words youve looked up and makes flash cards out of themwhich is awesome if youre reading a text book or something for school i dont recommend buying the charging block if you have a smart phone then you already have a block that allows a usb charger to go into an outlet the battery life is really long so you can charge it for a couple hours then use it for a month straight without charging again basically dont waste your money on the charging block if you already have on in summary awesome product no need to buy charging block,i love my kindle
2.0,i had one of the key pad kindle ereaders which they do not make anymore i loved it it froze up on a screen and would not change pages or do anything i had it for probably 10 years i use my kindle for reading only so i do not need or want all the extras the customer service person told me there was no difference in the one i had and the touch screen one i specifically asked if it would fit in the case i used for my old kindle because it was leather and had the built in light he assured me that it would fit the new one so i ordered it i have had the new one for about 2 weeks and would not order it again i hate the touch screen it does not fit in the case i have in fact there is no way to even use that case i never had any problems with my old one when shopping or downloading a book from cloud this one cant ever seem to find a connection and therefore is useless unless the book is already downloaded on the devise from my house i am very unhappy with this purchase and would find an old used one like i had before buying one like this if i had to do it over,not what i was told
3.0,this is my second kindle  and i love it great product,and i love it
5.0,i know that i am way late to the kindle game but i am very impressed with this ereader its easy to use lightweight and has a great battery life im able to read 3 books without charging i also love that it is small enough to fit in my purse i bought it on sale for 49 and it was money wellspent,perfect little ereader
3.0,like it but where do i get a replacement for the power cord,three stars
5.0,this is my first kindle and i love it the screen is small however the words are large enough to read the touch response is fast and i have had no issue turning the pages back and forth this device is not backlit so you will need ambient light to read by this was not a huge deal for me because there is no screenstrain on your eyes overall i would buy this again,first time kindle owner i love it
5.0,i love the display it feels like im ready an actual book,five stars
5.0,i am an avid reader i truly love and i am truly enjoying my kindle paperwhite i can now read my favorite books without staining my eyes from using my ipad when i first received my kindle i was so excited i just had to open the package and inspect it though i was pressed for time because i had to head off to work to my utter amazement amazon had already registered my kindle so basically all i had to do was set the time and charge it a liitle i just want to say thank you amazon you guys are the best i am a very satisfied customer,i truly love my kindle
4.0,flickers at times when changing pages or taking any action,gr8 battery but flickers
5.0,the touchscreen is very good i am still getting used to it however the ease of changing type size is great but i still havent figured out how to access the game i hadhave on my older version which resurrected from the near dead upon arrival of the replacement the times subscription is a little easier to use also on balance it is a better product,the touchscreen is very good i am still getting used to it however
2.0,good for reading during the day but not for night reading,two stars
3.0,ok its a kindle so its a great thing however it does not compare favorably to the older model it is awkward to hold which gets pretty significant when one is reading a book for more than a few minutes the touch screen is either too sensitive or not responsive enough depending on what youre trying to do if you want to enter your code it is unresponsive and takes a looong time to register each touch if youre trying to move your fingers to a comfortable position the screen registers the corner of your knuckle as a touch and starts to change the font or go to the home page or something else that interferes with the actual reading i broke my old model by mistake and am very very sorry that i have to make do with this one now makes me wonder what reading a nook is like battery life is good as always,if only i hadnt had to get this new and improved kindle
2.0,the screen was really dim and hard to read i returned it,two stars
3.0,had issues getting the documents feature to work and never was able to resolve this issue even with the help of amazon technical support thought about sending it back but just am not up for the struggle again guess i will just do without that feature even though i cannot download book galleys to preview have had a little trouble using the touch screen but i think i will get used to that,had a document issue
3.0,was happy with most of it but i couldnt read in the dark,three stars
4.0,i bought it so i could read by the pool i have a kindle fire for inside and at night got a great price but wish that i would have got the paper white one i really wish i had the back lit screen so i could read in bed at night,got a great price but wish that i would have got the 
4.0,need more support of the most popular ebook format epub,four stars
5.0,super happy with this purchase best ereader out there this is well made the durability is impressive the touch screen response is excellent with almost no delays and of course the battery life last for almost an eternity you cant go wrong with this ereader but dont expect to read comics on it for obvious reasons its not designed for that but you still can load them on there with no issues this is strictly for text novels however manga because of how its drawn works well on it but if youre looking to read dc or marvel you are better off getting a kindle fire to appreciate the artwork,durable and long battery life good for manga
3.0,it is not intuitive i still have to learn how to use it,it is not intuitive i still have to learn

5.0,loved mine so much i bought one for my sister for christmas,five stars
5.0,as a person who really doesnt read much i have to say this thing is fantastic its light enough to not make my hands tired and the screen is super easy to read i love the dictionary portion of it as well honestly if you are just looking for a basic reader dont spend a ton of money on anything more advanced then this,awesome reader
3.0,i wish it could be attached to a cover like my first kindle,three stars
4.0,got this as a present for my mother for mothers day she had a kindle keyboard for forever and finally needed a replacement the buttons and keys were starting to not work and the screen had seen better days she says she prefers the touch screen to the page buttons on her old kindle personally i just think this kindle in a little small but shes happy thats what matters,the buttons and keys were starting to not work and the screen had seen better days she says she prefers the touch screen

5.0,my 13 year old granddaughter purchased this to replace a kindle fire hd 1st generation that she hardly ever used she was extremely limited as to when she could read from it she absolutely loves the improvements its like a book glarefree and she can read anytime anyplace its lightweight and the features are updated and improved this is the lowend model but has everything needed to make her very happy im going to be getting one for myself,its like a book
5.0,this ended up being the perfect gift for my mom who used to spend a lot of time searching through book stores for her favorite author the only negative is i thought it came with a light but it doesnt so you cant read in the dark also as a side note youre able to torrent books and convert them to epub or mobi using calibre and load them right on to the kindle i would convert them from pdf so that a cover is included and the feature that lets you define words not that i would illegally download books or anythinghahjust saying its possible,this ended up being the perfect gift for my mom
5.0,this is a gift and i can not tell you how happy she is with it, a gift and i can not tell you how happy she is with it
4.0,functionality is great i wish it was a backlit screen though,four stars
4.0,this is a great kindle i love it the only thing that keeps me from rating 5 stars is that there was a problem with my family library and i neeeded a lot of amazon help to even get close to fixing it,great
1.0,i did extensive research by reading the kindle site and could not find any specific information about text to speech i assumed that like the old kindle this one also had the feature not true i called the help line and discovered that this feature was not available,i assumed that like the old kindle

1.0,it doesnt work correctly i cant advance or turn the page,one star
5.0,i am not into tec and love real books and do not like the idea of books that one owns being stored on some cloud i have wall to ceiling cases full of wonderful old history books i love the way they look and feel in my hands and the way they smell with that said i am surprised i am enjoying the kindle my son gave me for my birthday i can stick it in my purse and carry it easily with me i am disappointed there has to be light in order for it to work i had thought that would be one of the nice things about it being able to read in bed without turning a night light on and disturbing my partner i see no sense in paying for something that is not tangible and when the electrical source is gone cannot be accessed so will probably stick to free books with that said i am enjoying the kindle and will probably like it more as time goes on,geezer says kindle ok
3.0,screen is great in bright light nearly useless in dim light,meh
3.0,i liked my old kindle with the push button to turn page the swipe one is ok but i prefer the old model sometimes when i swipe it thinks i want to highlight or something else  i wish they hadnt changed it,i liked my old kindle with the push button to turn 
5.0,it was wonderful gift from my son and family for mother day,five stars
5.0,it is a great little device to read on i dont use it for anything else as it only had an amber screen but it is small and weighs nothing and can be read in the sunlight just not in the dark like the kindle fire which i also have totally worth the cost,my little book
1.0,archived items from old kindle not transferred to new kindle,archived items
5.0,i bought it by mistake my daughter wanted a kindle fire so i was going to return it but my husband convinced me to give it a try and im glad i did i use to read a lot but we also move a lot and packing books is a pita so i havent bought new books in a while since i had the kindle i already read several book 1 per week even with my busy hectic schedule the gray display is really easy on the eyes the device is lightweight fits in my purse and in my hand comfortably im glad i didnt return it,amazing
5.0,i am so happy with the purchase i absolutely love my kindle,five stars
4.0,i am pleased with the kindle books are easy to read easy to load i successfully borrowed a library book there is an excellent selection of books both free and for purchase the ads are not intrusive battery life is excellent it charges quicklydownside is that the touch screen occasionally advances more than one screen at a time and getting back to the starting point is sometimes a problem i would prefer that the charge level be visible within a book so low charge state if it occurs would not be a surprisei think this device is valuable as a singlepurpose device a book reader and well worth the cost,an excellent singlepurpose digital book reader
5.0,i love this kindle my first wish i had gotten one sooner,five stars
3.0,i had the lowest level nook from three years ago and thought id upgrade with the glarefree touchscreen kindle i wish i had gone back to a nook i bought the kindle for the screen and it is better although not a dramatic change from the older nook the kindle is also faster when opening a book but page turning seems about the samethe best thing is the battery on the down side you cannot expand the memory with an sd card on the kindle which i find very frustrating i would love to use margin notes except the touchscreen is ridiculously sensitive and it either turns the page or only highlights a single word when i want the paragraph adding the note is not exactly great either the same sensitivity interferes when trying to look up a word if you dont get it just exactly right you simply turn the page sigh,nice on speed and looks but the touchscreen is not great
5.0,makes reading easy and addictive actual books are not for me,five stars
5.0,i love the kindle i have prime so i am able to borrow books for free through the lending library which is a great benefitafter i purchased this we went on vacation and i was able to read without any glare on the beaches of jamaica the one thing i like is the new smart lookup you can lookup dictionary definitions or even wikipedia entries all without leaving your pagebattery life is excellent if you read for 1 hour a day the battery will last 2 weeks with wifi signal turned off if wifi signal is on it kwill constantly seach for the connection and that will drain your batteryi am not sure how many books this holds but it has to be alot i have over 100 because i never deletecharging time is a little slow when i charge mine it takes about 35 hours to fully charge other than the charging time this kindle is great if you purchase the one with special offers you will see ads everytime you turn it on no big deal no ads while reading,the kindle is very impressive
5.0,ive long since graduated to a paperwhite and really wouldnt buy this anymore im spoiled now with the built in light no more clumsy clip ons i first bought this when it went to 79 i wasnt sure i could grow to like reading on an electronic device but at that price i was ready to try it out my reading is done almost exclusively on the kindle now and i love paper books but really the only reason im throwing in this review is to counter all the one and two star ratings from the people who hate it because the light isnt adjustable or other such nonsense but it is a great device,its a great basic ereader device
5.0,this is a really great product it makes reading much easier whether you have too many books or if you have trouble with understanding words just highlight if your confused and the meaning pops up or it gives reference to other uses in the book youre currently reading i would recommend a kindle to any book lover​,awesome product
5.0,still getting used to it but so far i like it due to my arthritis i have trouble turning pages in a book this has become my bible i like having several translations and i can have the all in this one unit it is easy to read small enough to easily carry,but so far i like it due to my arthritis
5.0,i bought this as a gift for a friend she likes it very much,good gift
3.0,iim returning this kindle because whispernet refuses to work with the att beam device i have to download the files and somehow make it work i can open a real paperback and start enjoying or i can waste time dorking around with whispernet not my problem i have better things to do than to fix amazons technical problems,or i can waste time dorking around with whispernet

5.0,i adore my little kindle i didnt know that i would like it that much since we own two multiuse tablets but its very nice to tell my kid no this is full of moms books and doesnt have anything on it for you its light weight and fits into a large coat pocket or the front pocket of my purse im a huge fan,love my kindle
5.0,i love my kindle i can even read in the bright sun awesome,as good as the original maybe better
1.0,the only good thing about this kindle is the price this was my third kindle kindle2 paperwhite now this one with its yellowish dim screen and its definitely gone from good to fair to bad the law of diminishing returns i returned this one and will stay with my paperwhite and its annoying habits,the worst of all my kindles
5.0,i love my kindle i can even read in the bright sun awesome,five stars
4.0,this is exactly what i wanted i had hoped that by waiting and given the popularity of the device and its subsequent evolution a bargain would appear and it has i am retired and on fixed income i didnt not want to burden by children with suggestions about what presents i would like i just waited and here it is it contains all the options i require variable font size built in wifi that i have to invoke and if i dont i save battery life that i can use at my local library and glarefree display of the text i can read it at home or take it with me to the occasional doctors appointment a blessing since the magazine offerings there are of no interest to me the only thing i have to worry about is getting too many books a library i cant process before i kick the bucket something the ease of pointing and clicking can do i will be careful about thatmy kindle is a great solution to my problem of portable reading,i didnt not want to burden by children with suggestions about what presents i would like i just waited and here it is
5.0,i love both my kindles this one just as much as my first one,five stars
5.0,my kindle keyboard became inoperable on a recent trip i rely on my kindle when i am traveling i do have an ipad with a kindle application but i use the kindle almost exclusively when traveling i prefer its light weight and smaller size for reading on the plane it is also more convenient when my accommodation is a tent and not a hotel roomi particularly like having a touchscreen now i also like the way the new kindle is organizedi am very pleased with my new kindle,i particularly like having a touchscreen now
3.0,i do like it but i thought it would have more for the internet,three stars
5.0,love it purchased two for two younger teenagers one was already a reader the other was not both girls have already read several books only negative was that they needed light in the car to read of course for the price i knew light wasnt included great product very happy i purchased,love it purchased two for two younger teenagers
5.0,upgraded from older version very happy cuz its simple to use,very happy cuz its simple to use
5.0,i have been hesitant to acquire a kindle of my own for some time as i thought the electronic pad would be inferior to holding a paper book in my hands i received this for christmas however and i have to say that i have been very impressed with the kindle i recently took it on a trip with me to arizona and it was able to be used for several hours each day on a single charge prior to trip allowing me to read several books during the trip while i still lament not being able to hand somebody a book i just read and urging them to read it not many of my friends have kindles but there is apparently a kindle share thing you could otherwise do this promises to get a great deal of use from me in the months to come,had low initial expectations was impressed with how well it works
4.0,nice ereader but wish i had strung for next one up in price,nice
1.0,the kindle is ok but i much prefer to read books on my iphone,one star
3.0,my wife doesnt like it at all she would rather have a tablet,three stars
4.0,wish it had an ability to light the screen for bedtime reading,four stars
5.0,i have wanted a kindle since they first came out years ago i was finally able to get one for myself this christmas its my own personal tradition to get myself things as i shop for others so i dont get jealous anyway this is one of the best gifts i have ever given myself it is quick and easy to use and navigate the battery i have only charged once in the month i have had it i already have a nice little library of books to choose from i hope to have this for years to come and i will definitely get another one when this one retiresedit just a little side note i dont make much but there are a lot of free books that are great on amazon there is also kindle unlimited which is like an amazon library card and you can check out 10 books at a time for ten bucks a month i also joined a site called bookbubcom and they send daily emails with a list of books that are between 299 and free ive added so many books to my kindle library with that site its also not just for amazon there are books that are on google and much more so i can still read lots of books and not spend a ton of money,i love my kindle
5.0,very easy to use and to transfer everything from my old kindle,five stars
5.0,the kindle lives up to its promises it was easy to setup downloads books quickly and is an enjoyable way to read its light to hold and turns pages quickly of course without any light you must use it in lit rooms or outdoors this means the battery lasts a long time i also have a smartphone and an ipad so i can use one of them if i need a backlight the kindle software puts up a dialog box when you pick up your book asking you if you want to jump to the most advanced position no matter which platform you were last reading it on some not all books even have the option to read out loud an audiobook and they still keep track of your last stop point when you go back to the nonaudio version of the book i have always liked the kindle reader software now its even better to have a kindle too especially when i take it outdoors to read,kindle lives up to its promises
5.0,good device makes reading more enjoyable than regular tablet,good device makes reading more enjoyable than regular tablet
4.0,really enjoyed the little time i spent with this before handing it over to my kid the parental controls work great and he really enjoys reading on it he really struggles with books but the kindle has made it a joy for him and he can adjust the text size to better fit his needs fantastic tool for the little ones,great for kids too
2.0,screen is too small i am continually swiping to the next page,two stars
5.0,everything is as described it downloads books fast it is small light the cover feels heavier than the reader lol touch screen responses very well and no back light as expected like reading an actual black and white printed book,everything is as expected
3.0,cant figure how to lighten background to read without light on,three stars
5.0,love it very small and extremely light weight fits right in the inner pocket of my vest and coat highly recommend it you just need to get a light for night reading and found a slim cheap case on ebay,love it very small and extremely light weight
4.0,no back light but for the price it couldnt be better i love it,worth it
3.0,god knows why this device freezes and requires a reboot luckily usually takes only seconds every 5 even 3 pagesalso though less important i wish there was a way to have a sense of progress visàvis traditional pages page numbers the system of pages or progress is measured differently on kindle,restored my reading habit but crashes every 35 pages
4.0,it is smaller than the original kindle but overall it is great,four stars
5.0,and it works perfect still the water wiped off no damage so so so pleased the videos of the kindle on the beach are truethis is my first ereader i have watched my mom go from a sony ereader to a nook tablet and never really cared now looking at my bookshelf full of books i never get the chance to read i decided it might be time for me to invest in my own reading device i knew right off the bat i wanted eink reading on a computer is hard enough and no matter what i would be doing tablets hurt my eyes like crazykeeping this review simple i like how light and small this kindle is it will fit perfectly in my purse i cant wait to see how convienent it is to carry a book more like tons of books with me everywhere downloading books is easy and the device itself seems simple enoughthe one thing i will need to get used to is the special offers being the off screen when you press the power button to normally turn a tablets screen off the special offers pop upupdateafter a months use i will keep my rating as a 4 i managed to get this device at 60 because it was on sale rather than the regular 80 and at times i wish i had just splurged and got the paperwhite but honestly it isnt worth it for meanyway all that i have previously said still holds true i have read 5 books in a month compared to 3 physical books in the past 2 years the kindle has made me want to read morei have purchased about 70 free kindle books which more than cover the cost of the device in itselfi love its portability and being able to read on long car rides with the glaring sun,full bottle of water emptied on it on accident
3.0,the kindle itself is fine the problem with this model is the availability of books and games that can be ordered for it i tried to order several games only to get the message that this item is not available on this model not good,the kindle itself is fine the problem with this model is the availability 
4.0,i love having moved from the buttons to this value priced touch screen with two exceptions first i didnt realize how much i was depending on the texture on the back of my old kindle to keep from dropping it the cheaper plastic on this new model is super slick and dropable i added some textured stickers on day two of ownershipbut much more important brush the screen with the edge of your sleeve or heaven forbid place it face down in your lap for a sec and your font size will be changed at first i thought no big deal but i have been using my new kindle for two days and i have probably fix the font 100 times thats getting old fast and apparently touch kindle users have been asking for a font lock for at least two years,great but needs a better lock screen
3.0,not having the glare is great but the screen is a little dark,three stars
5.0,i love everything about it except for the highlighting feature i had a lot of trouble with the highlighting feature as it would frequently bug out and would want to highlight the entire page when i was trying to just get to the end of a paragraphthis happens a lot and its making me not want to use the highlighting feature because it often takes me at least 12 minutes to have the highlighter stop at the correct place,98 perfect
3.0,i am having trouble getting thehome and other things to come up on the screen i like my first kindle much better but this was a gift for a family member i also did not realize this one would have no color,a little dissapointing
1.0,screen much to small be useful ill br returning this product,screen much to small be useful ill br returning this product
4.0,i forgot to check if it had audio am enjoying the touch screen,four stars
4.0,while trying to transition from paper books to digital i found my backlit tablet hard to get adjusted to so i thought that i would try the kindle and i really like that the screen looks like a paper book page i dont mind the advertising because it is not obnoxious their is no blinking flashing ad at the bottom of the page the screen functions were simple and easy the page turns were fast i now have many books at my disposal while traveling without the weight and bulk of paper books the kindle was a great buy for me,the kindle was a great purchase
5.0,i like it smaller that my last one i have it use outside yet,five stars
4.0,good for just reading kind of wish it was backlit you have to read with good lighting for sure great battery life i rarely use my ipad now apparently i only really used my ipad to read i use my phone for everything else the kindle is perfect because its lighter than my ipad but bigger than my cell phone,great for just reading
2.0,it is good to read in the sun but otherwise it is a piece of junk,sun reader
5.0,quick set up easy to use and clear to read i wondered if the special offers would be annoying but they only appear when the kindle sleeps one touch wakes it up and the ads are gone i have a nook ereader which i would rate five stars also and only purchased the kindle as several authors works i enjoy are only offered on a kindle a few purchases and the kindle pays for itself when compared to buying the books in hardback,easy to use and clear to read
5.0,the kindle is great couldnt be more pleased with this purchase,the kindle is great couldnt be more pleased with this
5.0,not long ago a revised version of kindle 6 glarefree touch basic was on sale at a very tempting price so i took the plunge my only regret is that i didn’t do it sooner this is a very useful little device one feature i really like is “locations ” tap upper right hand corner to place a marker for later reference which stays in place until deleted i have the means to convert most any document into a “mobi” file and place it on my reader for later use that in itself saves me plenty on paper and printer ink there are more advanced and expensive versions available but for basic functions good battery life and readability you can’t go wrong with this handy unit,great little unit
1.0,hard to read screen not bright enough for a older person to use,one star
5.0,i like hard copy but carrying books for business trip can be challenging its great for the travel and its working great for me i read in different languages and kindle can display those languages it is an added convenience im glad i bought kindle,working great
5.0,i love it the device works very well the pages turn very quick,five stars
1.0,the kindle kept giving me internal error when registering to my amazon account i called amazon help desk firstly they could not figure out what version i had then they disputed the serial number that i read of the kindle like i was making up a 16 digit number for kicks and giggles then none of the prompts or screens that they read off their device matched mine finally after 2 agents and 40 minutes of my time which i will never get back they said that the order was not completely fulfilled and i would have to wait for them to do that internally first and my device would be updated via wifi still waiting,one star
5.0,love it i bought it for my daughter and have really enjoyed it,excellent
5.0,after using the kindle fire hd it took alittle time to get used to reading on the paperwhite the model i purchased didnt come with a light and the letters are in a special magnetic ink instead of being digital it is light in weight and easy to hold and the battery lasts for days i think the write up says up to a week i havent had the opportunity to use it in bright sunlight but i have heard that it is great for that i bought it with a black friday discount which made it an offer i couldnt refuse,i highly recommend the 6 kindle
5.0,i wasnt sure how much i would use it but its great i love it, sure how much i would use it but its great i love it
5.0,love it i didnt get the paperwhite because i dont need bells and whistles i also have a book lite that fits on this perfectly i do mostof my reading during the day so this is perfect downloading books is a breeze thank you amazon for a great product,love it
1.0,this is a horrible kindle i purchased this when i lost my backlit one about 3 months later theyve come out with another backlit kindle clearly a case of planned obsolescence very disappointed in this amazon product and in amazon,planned obsolescence poor quality and disappointing
4.0,surprised by the apparent small size actually just the wide sides and external keyboard are missing same screen size with great page turning only through touch screen rather than button preferred the standby pages rather than the advertisements,same screen size with great page turning only through touch screen rather than button
5.0,i have had this kindle for 2 years i use it many hours per day and last night it stopped working and i cannot revive it  i am elderly and lightly disabled so reading is my best friend and i cannot read books as they are too heavy kindle is light and works great during power outages now i will buy the same model and transfer the unread books hopefully amazon will transfer the books from the old one onto the new one cannot go wrong with this ereader,wonderful piece of equipment
3.0,not easy to navagate i am reading a book want to switch books and dont know how to get to main menu when i was in the main menu not easy to find your books took time to figure things outeasy to read swipe to change page is nice but gentle or you could go a couple of pages i feel once i get the hang of things it will be fine,not easy to navagate
5.0,i love this i purchased this to take camping so that i could have longer battery life than my kindle fire hd and also a glarefree screen it holds a charge for a long time and is easy to read the touch screen makes it simple to use as well it also has an experimental browser that will work in a pinch if you just need to look up somethingi would definitely buy this again,love it
2.0,this is my first kindle and it did not come with any instructions,no instructions
4.0,had one of the first kindles ever and loved it but accidentally destroyed itlooked hard for a simple kindle my preference this is a bit smaller than i would like but i am enjoying the touch screen had to work way too hard to find a cover that would fit it however,nice but why isnt it sold with a cover that fits
5.0,loved it works a little slow at first but i can deal with that,five stars
5.0,my mom got a kindle touch for my son for his birthday i liked it so much that i ordered one for myself to replace the kindle keyboard that had brokenmy son has actually read from his kindle every day where it used to be a fight to get him to read a book thank you amazon,great gift
5.0,makes reading very easy to see like a paperback booklove it,best reader of 2015
5.0,i received my kindle a few days ago and was very pleased with the item i took it out of the box and set it up it was so easy to use i have already read 4 books and starting my 5th i would recommend this item to anyone who loves to read, my kindle a few days ago and was very pleased with the item
4.0,great just wish i could read it in bed in the dark like my kindle,four stars
5.0,awesome little gadget does exactly what its supposed to do read a bookvery easy to operate nothing complicatedits very slim and will fit anywhere the battery will last a long time  the screen is excellent and all i wanted was the feel of a real book instead of the glare of a traditional screen like the iphone or ipadi recommend it for books but not comic books of course use your color screen kindle app on other devices or bigger kindles if you are a comic book reader i got this on xmas and honestly anyone that likes to read should get it the ads that are shown if you get the special deal do not interfere with the reading they are shown only when the device is on standby ,best book reader so far
5.0,it nice for the price its wonderful with a little clip on light,five stars
5.0,amazing great buy love the size of it and the battery last forever and that is so nice when reading a book or many books easy to use make you when you read at night you have a light close by other wise you cant see anything this is my 2nd kindle and i love both of them,amazing but
3.0,it is not intuitive how to switch between books without restarting,three stars
3.0,functional love how lite it is the problem is the touch screen i had a kindle keyboard and loved it and used it to death the touch screen is very sensitive also the fact that different areas of the screen do different things this perhaps is just going to take some getting used to but for now it is somewhat frustraiting the battery is amazing i have charged it twice once when i first got it and then three weeks later,love how lite it is
1.0,i have had 4 kindles i wore out because i am a avid readerthis is worthlessdont know how to work itno buttons to enlarge printno list of booksafter 4 the product is to be better not go backwards to worthless and they dont call or email if you askdo i send it back or throw it in the trash,pitiful is the word
5.0,i was perfectly content with my old kindle keyboard but then i received warning that i would have to update it in march in order to continue obtaining books i tried following all the instructions to the letter leaving it attached overnight twice but couldnt make the update happen before seeking help i remembered that we had on hand a 2014 kindle 6 which my husband had received as a gift he never used it because he prefers to read on his ipad and has no problem taking that with him everywhere so since the kindle 6 didnt have to be updated to work i switched to using it with the touchscreen it was simple to learn so i bought a beautiful new cover that turns it on and off its slim and lightweighteven easier to carry in my purse very happy with it ,much better than updating old kindle
3.0,wish it had back lighting so i didnt have a light on in the room,three stars
5.0,what can i say purchased two of these one for my wife and one for myself decided to go with the kindle touch as it does not have a backlight was having some trouble staying asleep however discovered a sensible recommendation for improving sleep from a university of maryland website which suggested at least one hour of light reading before bedtime and if you use an ereader make sure it is not backlit in order to not reset your internal clock with a bright light so far so good we are both doing better at staying asleep thanks to the kindle,improve your reading and your sleep
5.0,bought it as a christmas gift for my mom she never puts it down,wonderful
5.0,i love it its light weight and perfect such a great price too,five stars
3.0,i wish it had a light i will have to save enough money to buy that,need light
3.0,priced at 30 its ok but youll need a reading light or sunlight,dim and low contrast screen
3.0,advantages battery life is awesome can last for a week very light easy to bring around a good alternative way to read real physical book the most affordable option among the kindle family devicesdisadvantages slow touch screen response especially when you used to smartphone touch screen response rate which is quite annoying lack of free nice ebook to download lack of good chinese novel eg those from jin yong to download lack of different versions of bible to download no colour,an ok book reader device
3.0,probably me not being used to kindlei formerly had a bn reader,three stars
5.0,most useful when using dictionary instead of cumbersome way of my old kindle enjoy the touch screen and menu on top of the screen availability am still in the process of learning it and am sure there are many more beneficial aspects just waiting for me to work with them the ability to simply touch a section and highlight it has been very useful also being retired and at 80 not much into a lot of activity enjoy my new kindle for at least 8 hours a day better than tv or out shopping and amazons choices of ebooks is bountifulno,totally enjoying my touch screen
5.0,i have very limited needs for this product and it meets all of them,five stars
3.0,i had gen 4 kindle and returned it as part of tradein program now i upgraded to this model i love the touch interface so far only few grips software isnt much intutive in the place of homebutton and back button keys screen looks bit smaller kindle is way thicker than sleek 4th genbut love the touch portion no need to click side buttons to turn pages over,upgrade came with inconvinience
3.0,should have had a light screen difficult to see overall its okay,three stars
3.0,i mean it served my purpose and i have read like 5 books on it since i got it back in the winter of 2014 i dont have nothing to complain about its physical design and materials amazon used to make it yes this one is thicker than paperwhite and feels very plastic but im completely fine though what you expect from a 80 dollar device an iphone costs you 700 dollars but i have to say the screen is decentthe touch screen has its pros and cons you can click a word or a name to check dictionary or xray which is very nice if its buttons it will be a huge painbut the touch screen is very sensitive it changes my font and font size even if i didnt purposefully do it when sometimes i open my kindle i was a few pages ahead or behind where i left and was in a weird font and font size thats why i have to set the password and i suppose kindle is not smart enough to enter my password automatically and change my font sizehonestly thats my only complaint i bought this version because i need something simple and basic without chunk of other nonreading related capabilities i prefer to read a paperback but if i read on a ebook i hope my ebook will as close to a paperback as possiblei just hope amazon wont ever forget our very intrinsic motive to buy a kindle so there is still a kindle in the market that i need to buy what we need is something really simple and please dont add unnecessary functions to this device in the future i hate tablets i have a ipad mini and the screen broke but i never bothered to fix it, mean it served my purpose and i have read like 5 books on it since i got it back 
5.0,bought it for my daughter we both love it i like the touch screen,we both love it i like the touch
4.0,i have a nook tablet and got this simply to be able to read outside i love it many of the people who leave negative feedback dont know what they are getting its simply a reader very easy to use the reason i left one star off is because i really wish it came with a little direction sheet i didnt even know how to turn it off etc i had to go online to figure it out a quick start guide would have been great,needs a quick start guide
5.0,a bit thicker than the 6th generation but love the touch screen d,five stars
5.0,after a lot of oscillations between this one and the paperwhite and after side by side comparisons for several hours i have decided this onei could not see any resolution difference between them even with the smallest fontsince i can not tolerate any kind of illuminated screen especially in dark this one is perfect thought you need some external light to read a real booki bet god will send the next holy book directly to the kindle ,perfect device
4.0,i wish i can click the frame to go to the next page like nook does, click the frame to go to the next page like nook does
4.0,prosi like it a lot i try to stay away from lighted devices as much as possible given how often im in front of screens and this is exactly what i wanted quick to work clear durable and so thin and easy to carry around it slides right in my purse im so glad kindle kept carrying the originalconsthe battery dies pretty quickly i turn it off but it dies much more quickly than the original i had beforeim also a bit disappointed that it has a small black mark on the screen that doesnt seem to go away but ive gotten used to it and for the price it can be ignored,pretty good
4.0,would like to print from it and share a book i bought with someone,okay
4.0,first one i received did not work correctly locked up and wouldnt fully charge exchanged for a new on and it works great working with the kindle specialist was a pain but eventually got the job done,first one i received did not work correctly
3.0,it seems ok but give me time to use it its to early for a review,three stars
4.0,i am very happy with my new kindle being new to kindle this model met all my expectations and is a very easy reader in both daylight and at night it does not have a backlight which i wondered how i would like that however i do not miss it it is light weight and fits nicely in my purse to keep with me at all times my only issue is the advertising that amazon puts on for the screensaver that i have to look at all the time unless i completely power down the screen i dont like to be sold to constantly on a device that i bought and wish i could change the screensaver therefore i give it a 4 star versus 5,nice kindle for the price
5.0,purchased as a gift for my wife it is her 1st kindle and she loves it it was very simple for me to set it up and show her its various features and how to use themi have had a kindle for several years 4th gen page turning buttons on sides with keyboard battery life doesnt seem to be as good as with my 4th gen with moderate use2 to 3 hours per dayshe has to charge it about every 6 or 7 days my 4th gen with about the same use will usually last 3 weeks before requiring a charge neither of us consider this to be much of an issue though its ease of use is the most important thing to her and she hasnt had any problems using it for her being able to highlight a word and instantly get its definition is a huge plus id have no problem buying one of these for myself if i didnt already own a kindle, battery life doesnt seem to be as good as with my 4th gen
5.0,this kindle replaced another simpler earlier version and it took some time to get used to it now ive learned to use it i find it an easy device to use i wouldnt want to go back to my old one,kindle 6 glarefree touchscreen display
2.0,i received this couple of days back and ordered it for my son who is not a big fan of reading the screen as its being shown in the kindle main page video is not all how my product screen is infact its more duller than a book we mostly have yellow light in our apartment and in the evening i struggled to read it at an angle if i leave it flat directly below the light its a lot better when i saw the review i picked kindle ahead of the fire tablets because they didnt had some features like word wise and vocabulary builder etc i am afraid it seems either i picked up the wrong kindle or was expecting a bit too much out of this its very difficult to convince kids to use it with all those high resolution smart tablets out there,display not as brightsharp as you would see in the demo video
4.0,i have never had a kindle always read from an android or ipad so the no glare is great just wish i could brighten the background just a bit it is also hard to see the books i havent as yet read,easy to read outside
5.0,i bought my first kindle about 4 years ago and it ended up freezing up on me i returned it to amazon and got a 20 credit towards a new one which was awesome im glad i upgraded mine anyway this model is way more intuitive to use and the touch screen feature is an upgrade from what i had,i returned it to amazon and got a 20 credit towards a new one which was awesome im glad i upgraded mine anyway
4.0,great value for the money would be better with a backlightbut its lightweight and easy to carry i use it when im going somewhere that i might have time to wait or sit read but do not want to carry my kindle fire around for the entire day it does the job i wanted it to do,great value for the money
1.0,i purchased this kindle with a christmas giftcard this was never dropped dunked or stepped on it completely quit working in less than 6 months i did a hard reset which brought it back to life for a week then it quit again and will not restart ive had a kobo for 3 years it is still working hard i regret every kindle book i bought and now can only access on my tablet,i purchased this kindle with a christmas giftcard this 
4.0,the first time i received this item i wanted to returned cause i have a lot of pdf books and at the beggining it looked like the kindlle did not handle weell that format but my problem was the configuration once i fix it waoo i liked a lot i also have the nook touch and nook with light but these one is even better i dont gave 5 stars cause i cant see how many pages are in the book,3 stars later on 4 stars
4.0,love it,four stars

5.0,love it,five stars
3.0,i would rate it higher but i had a terrible struggle learning to use it no getstarted instructions on paper came with it i had never used a kindle and never used an iphone or touchscreen smart phone and touching the screen here and there to make it work guessing where and how to do it as the screen was filled over with writing was very hard i still mess up a lot i have no wifi at home so i went to wendys and couldnt connect as i had to sign in and couldnt as i am not registered with them so i went to panera to connect and register via their wifi i had never used wifi so i had a struggle with it but finally connected online the whole thing was a hard experience but i am now able to do some reading and now that i can i can give the kindle a higher rating but i still need to form the habit of using the kindle to read i wonder if that will happen,not easy getting startedbut i finally made it
5.0,love it,five stars
5.0,perfect,five stars
5.0,amazing,five stars
5.0,my family has 4 kindles im biggest fan of the kindle from mongolia,kindle is the best ebook reader
3.0,its ok except for a permanent line across the middle of the screen,three stars
3.0,good in a pinch when we are both readng but it really needs a light,baby kindle
3.0,works well but it feels super cheap and definitely not very durable,three stars
5.0,ive had it for a month i love it long battery life enables me to read on the go a lot easier that lugging around books it is super lightweight easy to hold with one hand simple and elegant interface i have already finished 3 books with it and bought one for my brother on his birthday,i love it long battery life
5.0,i love my kindle paper white the only think i would have wanted is a back light but i got mine for a cheaper price so it didnt come with one other than that it allows me to read when im outside at the beach or pool so im very happy with it,great buy
4.0,this is my first kindle and i like it very much its easy to read and carry with one hand in fact i like kindle paperwhite more because it has a builtin light but i need to pay for 40 more for it and its only the last year version so i considered to buy this one instead ive used it everyday and then start forgeting about buying a real book again you dont need to buy another wall adapter if you have adapter for your mobile phone that can put usb plug into it there are couple things that i dont like first is about the battery the battery life advertised as it last for several weeks but if i use it everyday it can last for only a week or less so i need to recharge it the second thing is about its stability my kindle got slower and hanged after using it for a couple weeks at that time i cannot read the book at all but fortunately its back to normal after i restarted it long press about 10 seconds at the onoff button i would recommend this to my friends for sure,not perfect but i like it
2.0,it took a while but i finally got it all set up like my kindle,like my kindle
5.0,this is a great product it is super lightweight and very userfriendly setting it up was no problem at all and i was reading a book on it within 5 minutes of taking it out of the box i personally think i read faster on this kindle than in a book not to say that i dont like books i still do it also is great for me because im practicing spanish and there is a translator and dictionary built in which makes reading in a second language easier,this is a great product it is super lightweight and very userfriendly
3.0,i expected a good browser included and its experimental this is 2015,not even fun
3.0,this is my 3rd kindle and i must say i prefer the first one which had a keyboard i love the backlit page however and can read all night with no lamp on i long for my page turning buttons since dexterity becomes a problem with age and when i hit to turn a page it may be to hard or in the wrong place and all kinds of surprises occur i read so much up to 3 books a day that i get frustrated with this version of kindle i am certain that dexterity only declines so who knows what the future kindles will bring for us older folks but hope the innovators keep us in mind,i love the backlit page however and can read all night 
4.0,it would be nice if it had a light for when i want to read before bed,four stars
4.0,very good for the pricei bought it with advertising i thought it would bother me but the truth is that the ads are pretty also only show up when its on standby i loved that does not reflect sunlight and is very lightso far i recommend it economic good quality very easy to carry and the screen is very sensitive,simple and lovely
5.0,it definitely lives up to the advertising i am very pleased with it,very pleased
5.0,i had a kindle keyboard for many years was very happy with it and never had any problems when i saw the offer for this kindle at a discounted price i decided to upgrade mainly for the touch screen features i am very happy i did this one is a little smaller and lighter than the previous model but very easy to use it is much easier in all aspects such as selecting a font finding a definition etc getting this kindle was a great decision and i am very happy with it it arrived timely and with very little packaging i would highly recommend,thrilled with upgrade from keyboard kindle
4.0,came promptly was what my wife wanted in a reader and we are pleased,basic kindle
1.0,i had to return this product after only 3 weeks it would not find wifi so i could not add or purchase ebooks,i had to return this product after only 3 weeks 
1.0,i am not finding this to be very user friendly at all i cant connect to my local library and since this was a gift i dont have the funds to purchase books to read im very disappointed at the lack of free content,im very disappointed at the lack of free content
3.0,my kindle keyboard lasted 5 years and when it died i quickly purchased the simple 6 glarefree model right away i was disappointed that it doesnt have the side flippers for turning pages i find that more often than not when i touch the screen on the right side to move to the next page it flips forward a few pages not just onewhen i lay on my right side and read in bed while holding this kindle with my left hand i cant turn the page may not seem like a big deal but it is to me i must investigate the other available kindlesto see if there is one more suited to my needs,ok but
5.0,greatread 4 or 5 hours a dayjust a great little thing ,great
5.0,i like my kindle this is the first one and i received it for christmas last year i love reading and the fact i can get free books or even low cost books are awesome with me on a fixed income this is great i may in the future get a kindle with a light built into it but out from that i have no complaints,i like my kindle
1.0,it has a lot of glare glarefree is a false advertisement,one star
4.0,i really would like the option to change the color of the background,four stars
5.0,just need to find a cover that isnt to costly i love my new kindle, to find a cover that isnt to costly i love my new kindle
4.0,bought as a replacement for a kindle touch works pretty much the same except the shutdown procedure is more involvedalso shutting down the wifi on the touch did not involve airplane mode as it does on the new one just differences thattake some time getting used to,good replacement for the touch
4.0,i like the kindle a lot but have had some difficulty figuring out how to get everything set up via the user guide some of it im still sorting out but im getting there the unit itself is lightweight easy to read and use i did notice that the colder my fingers were the more trouble i had getting the touchscreen to work,i like the kindle a lot
5.0,i took advantage of a prime day deal to buy this for my partner who is an avid reader but a reluctant adopter of new technology i have a firstgeneration kindle fire that i like very much and hoped my friend would benefit from the convenience and portability of an ereader there was no trouble at all setting it up and the matte screen looks great he doesnt mind the lack of a light especially if it means longer battery life it does he loves the small size the ease of buying books and the sleekness and userfriendliness of the kindle the ads book suggestions are not a problem at all theyre very subtle and sometimes interesting,great for a kindle newbie
5.0,this was surprisingly user friendly to start up and set up for my preferences the glare free feature is by far and away the best feature i am using this strictly for reading purposes and for that it is wonderful light weight small enough to fit in my small purse and easy to use,great reading device
5.0,10x better then the old e book readers love the touch screen aspect this lesser model is nice and simple no bells or whistles cool dictionary aspect it even lets you see areas of the book people highlighted most overall exactly what i needed i cant bring a book to work but this is perfect,10x better then the old e book readers

5.0,outstanding e reader it works even in bright sun the kindle weighs barley anything which makes it super easy to read my books download within 30 to 60 seconds with wifi the possibilities are endless the experimental browser is a bit tricky to work does not support html5 i dont ever really use it noting the kindle is not in color the battery lasts for weeks not days and charging is super fast if you do not want special offers hold down the power button until a screen pops up and tap screen off then it is just a blank screen so that takes care of the special offers which never really annoyed me the send to kindle email is great i can send pdf jpeg txt and lots more straight to my kindle the books are very well priced and with kindle unlimited it makes reading even better you get almost all the books for free in the store for just 999 a month ten dollars over all this is a great product i would recommend it to anyone who is looking for an e reader,kindle review

5.0,i have only had my kindle for a short amount of time but i absolutely love it i use to be completely against ereaders when they first came out and thought that actual books were just so much better however after taking a long vacation recently i understood how nice it would be carry around hundreds of book on a device that takes up hardly no space i also really enjoy the no glare screen that makes me feel like i reading from an actual book i would personally recommend this to anyone who loves to read books another plus is the ability to rent books from a library no late fees,great purchase

4.0,i had and older kindle that was actually a hand me down it wasnt even touch screen i loved it anyway well one fateful day i sat on it and cracked the screen it sucked this one is so new and shiny literally very easy to read display no straining no squinting menues are straightforward just a quick swipe and click to adjust most settings ill admit i was slow to get a digital reader and this isnt a real fancy one you can get on the regular internet it has a browser but for someone that thinks sitting at home and reading is like a dream vacation kindle is the s,i like books

3.0,this is my first kindle i bought it at a sale price of 5999 be cause i just want to read books on it so decided to start slow and if i like it i maymove up to a paperwhite for the light and whiter page so far i am satisfied with this one except for one annoying thing i thought when you go to amazon and use the option to remove a book then the book should no longer appear on the reader i however have a full book still on my kindle that i deleted if every book i buy stays in my library in spite of being deleted i will be very unhappy stuff like that will send me back to buying real books very quicklybooks update enough internet browsing brought me the help i needed i was able to delete completely two free books i didnt want,mixed feelings

5.0,received it as a christmas gift found it easy to set up and use it will go a long way toward reducing or eliminating the alreadyread book clutter within my household i can wholeheartedly recommend it to all who read as voraciously as i do td,an excellent acquisition 
5.0,i love my new kindle its exactly as described i read a lot so i find it convenient to have especially when traveling the display is crisp and easy to read and everything is quite simple to maneuver its lightweight but doesnt feel cheap of course it doesnt have a back light but for the price its a good deal other than not having a back light it does everything the paperwhite does if youre on a budget you should definitely get this just know that its solely an ereader no media,i love my new kindle
4.0,great gift for both kids and adults i am so glad i got it for christmas,four stars

2.0,very disappointed with this new kindle i had the previous version with buttons on the sides unfortunately that one has been misplaced i bought this new touch one while on sale since i love having the kindle for train rides but it is not living up to expectations the most annoying thing is that the touch seems to get caught on a glitch cycle where if i try to go back one page it takes me to a random forward page and then i hit back and it takes me forward again and i get stuck in a loop of 23 pages flipping back and forth and it takes 6 touches just to get back to my original spot and i give up on trying to go back a page because god only knows if ill ever be able to get back to my current location during this glitch cycle the bottom left corner always displays the same page number even when it is clearly a different page so i literally have no idea where im at in the book or how to get back where i wasi get lost in the book and not in a good wayalso this kindle seems to be slightly bulkier than the previous onenot by a lot but the frame is a few millimeters thicker which isnt a big deal other than the other one slid into back pocketsbags easieri honestly dont know why they felt the need to update to a touch screen for the basic kindleconsidering it is glitchy bigger and tapping a screen versus pressing a button doesnt change anything about my kindle reading experience but making me read my book like a flip book is really obnoxious,very disappointed with this new kindle
5.0,great for reading outdoors inexpensive in case of damage and glarefree,five stars
5.0,i like how simple the device is to use and the screen is very easy on the eyes i bought it for my mom but she is visually impaired and even on the largest font setting she could not see it i am using it and its great,awesome kindle
3.0,i love the nonglare but disappointed that it does not light in the dark,no light
3.0,really should be 25 stars i bought this kindle to replace my kindle keyboard which just died on me when i got it it made me sad i think the reading screen is the same size i think but it felt smaller i knew going in that it was touch screen but i didnt realize how much of an impediment to reading that would be my hands are often cold so i wear gloves a lot not good with the new kindle to me it felt more like reading on a phone yes the set up was easy and my old books appeared nicely but i didnt find it nearly as appealing thankfully the folks at amazon upon hearing my unhappiness allowed me to return it and i ordered a new old kindle so hopefully that one works out fyi for those who still have the plug charger that came with the older kindles this new kindle doesnt come with a power cord but the charger plug for your old kindle will work interconnect with this one so you dont need to buy a new charger if you still have your old one there isnt anything technically wrong with this kindle but for me the size and the feel were unappealing the lack of keyboard really wasnt a factor but the lack of page turning buttons was a factor agree with some other reviewers if i hadnt had a kindle before would likely have loved this one again glad amazon was willing to work with me and crossing my fingers for a new old kindle,it made me sad i think the reading screen is the same 
5.0,awesome i love it next best thing to having a paperback in your hands,five stars
4.0,have had the kindle 2 weeks now amazing little gadget the only thing i dont like is trying to read with lamp light is kind of difficult in retrospect if i had it to do all over again i would have have purchased a paperwhite,amazing little gadget
3.0,the mistake was mine i needed the paper white kindle for night reading,three stars
3.0,i dont really like the touch screen i accidently hit it and then lose my page i would rather have the buttons on the sides to change the pagesalso they do not have a case with a light built in for this model they have one for the 6th generation and i loved it hopefully the case and the light i bought will be just a good as the case with the light,i dont really like the touch screen
5.0,id rather have a kindle keyboard but this is the best thats available, rather have a kindle keyboard but this is the best thats available
5.0,excellent price and quality are both very satisfactory i like the look and feel of this display which reads like a book page the intended design of course its also very light to hold although i wouldnt mind a rougher surface on the frame so as to grip a little better i realize one can buy covers but then that adds cost and bulk which tends to defeat the advantages of this kindle by itself im enjoying reading more with this product than anything i could imagine since its so different from reading book pages yet so very advantageous i know its been around for some time but for those of us just joining the kindle brigade its just as satisfying now as it must have been for those experienced kindle readers of several years already and i have an ipad iphone mac and other pcs to read off of too but this little device will be great just because of its exclusive use for book reading what a joy,ok im new to kindle but its still fabulous
3.0,i am really looking forward to the big screen size for example a4 size,three stars
5.0,i purchased this to replace the original kindle and i have truly enjoyed it the touch screen is so much more convenient and there are more intuitive features that allow you control your experience that were not in the older version for example i set my kindle to not show all the highlights from previous readers admittedly i dont really care what previous readers found good enough to highlight particularly for fiction i just want to enjoy the book myself lastly i admit the back light in the paperwhite version would have been nice for night time reading but really an additional 40 so you can read without light i havent seen one to try it but its hard for me to think the convenience is worth the extra 40,great new version of the basic kindle
5.0,i have been against readers due to glare and size as an avid reader there is just something about an actual book in your hands this has been a great substitute there is no glare its lightweight it actually reads like a book its suprising how much the font looks and reads like a book i like that i can carry many books on my kindle i ride the train as commute and now i dont have the weight thanks amazon just another reason i am a returning customer,this has been a great substitute there is no glare
5.0,life changing device 10 books read in a 3 weeks spam is incredible wjow easy is to set up and start reading the difficult part is to stop reading honestly is addictice the feeling you get in the hands and the low stress you inflict in your eyes with this device makes wnat to read the whole day easy 5 stars,is incredible wjow easy is to set up and start reading
3.0,it okay for the price i dont see how to change the lighting and the glare free screen makes it a little too dark to read in bed at night its a lightweight inexpensive reader and it is what i expected its definitely no frills,it okay for the price i dont see how 
3.0,needs a back light also hard to adjust settings nook way easier to use,needs a back light also hard to adjust settings 
4.0,i can read books im only putting something here because i cant skip it,four stars
3.0,its not very user friendly and was difficult to set up i won it in a raffle also it is not compatible with textbooks which is the reason i wanted it i wold rather have a home button than the total touchscreen set up which is why i said its not user friendly it is easy to read outside but i wish it had a light behind the screen also i tried to add my moms account as the other adult and it wouldnt let me because i had had a different adult in the last 180 days which was a mix up i had when trying to set myself as the main owner,not user friendly and doesnt work with textbooks
3.0,disappointed that there is no decent cover available with a built in light,dissapointed
5.0,great user friendly only downfall is i bought it for 79 after waiting 2weeks for the price to drop the day after i purchased itneeded by xmas the price went down to 59 😒 typical bought as a gift for my teen daughter who has recently discovered a love for reading im sure she will get plenty of use out of this,great user friendly
3.0,i returned it and bought the paperwhite its ok i just prefer backlight,three stars
5.0,bought it reading on it and absolutely loving it the reviews said it wasnt much different than the paperwhite and i dont honestly see a difference this little gem is the prefect fit for my reading needs,great for the avid book reader
1.0,received this device as a replacement for the kindle paper white i purchased that was a loststolen device when i called amazon customer service to explain they had replaced it with the wrong version of kindle i was told they already made an exception to help me out and wouldnt do anything further my only recourse after over a week of dealing with the issue was to return it and not have a kindle not the nicest treatment from customer service department after being a long time devoted customer of amazon prime i am sorry to see that a company that calls itself customercentered is not actually so or perhaps they need to provide better training for some of their employees,or perhaps they need to provide better training for some of their employees
2.0,this is my second kindle the first had 3g and a keyboard the 3 g stopped working and after 2 hours on the phone with a nice lady from india they still couldnt find the problem and my phone died while she had me on hold and i couldnt stand the thought of calling back and the battery wouldnt really stay charged anymore had also gotten wifi so i got this new cheaper version the touch screen is beyond a nightmare the regions actually overlap so for example its impossible to highlight anything without the pages flipping but thats just an example i have other touchscreen devices and this is beyond the worst also the page turning forward region is on the right who holds their book with their dominant hand no one so if youre righthanded you cant just slip your thumb over to tap it i have lefthanded friends who feel theyre finally getting the recognition they deserve then its impossible to know what you have to do to turn a page because in the store its different from when youre reading and within things in the store it may be different turning the wifi on and off is also annoying because you have to go into a menu to change it actually i hate this thing but gave it an extra star just because well its a kindle and you can shop and get good prices etc otherwise it would be in the trash and id be investigating other ereaders,what a misery this thing is
5.0,love it easily read outside in bright sunshine and love the touchscreen,very pleased
5.0,i love my kindle its light weight easy on the eyes i love being able to browse through the books and having them instantly on my device i have it synced with my phone so i listen to books while i take my walks and it automatically updates where i left off so i can read on the kindle where i left off i actually like the ads because they are book or kindle accessories ads the ads introduce books i wouldnt normally look know about if they were product ads then it would bother me i love my kindle,i love my kindle
4.0,it would be nice if it gave the page number of the book while reading it,four stars

5.0,the nonglare screen is awesome reading at the pool is no problem i was skeptical but it is beyond my expectations in addition i recently had a detached retina and i can actually see and read more clearly on my kindle than on the printed page so pleased,why did i wait so long
5.0,i like the ease of use of this tablet as well as the screen it is handy to have a touch screen previously i owned one of the very first kindles that came out i liked it however the buttons that turned the page had been a problem for me flipping too soon etc that is why i like the touch screen the icons are well arranged well done,a good purchase if one just wants to read
3.0,i wish it came with a builtin light but other than that i am enjoying it,light

5.0,this is my 2nd kindle i have the 1st kindle fire and it still works great but i wanted something for ouside reading and this is perfect great price and very light easy to hold if you want a ereader for outside its the one,and it still works great but i wanted something for ouside reading and 
3.0,for a very basic ereader priced at 5400 its just about what i expected,an okay ereader
5.0,i found the app slow at like or tending to crash this is more convenient and faster only drawbacks i didnt have access to my books from other stores and publishers and the internal 4gb of memory are not enough its what has kept me from buying a paperwhite and voyager,five stars
2.0,it was to dark and i didnt like that it didnt light up for night reading,two stars
5.0,was completely on the fence if i wanted to keep expanding my book collection or jump into the 21st century of ereaders my fiancee got me this as a christmas gift and i couldnt be happier if money is tight or youre just unsure if an ereader is for you go with this kindle tons of sales and the price keeps dropping i can see the convenience of the backlight on the newer paperwhite kindle maybe reading at night when significant other is trying to sleep or in poorly lit areas but this kindle works just great,loving the world of ereaders
5.0,i the more expensive kindle do not worth the extra price this is amazing,this is amazing
5.0,i have used kindles since they first came out and i personally love my basic ereader because i read a lot and the batter life is much better than that of the tablets and i dont need the features that the paperwhite offers my most recent purchase of a kindle was as a gift for my husbands elderly aunt she loves to read but is most housebound and on a fixed budget the ability to change fonts order books digitally at a low price and check out books from her local library without leaving her house are just what she needed my husbands aunt received her kindle in the mail early in december and she calls me at least once a week to say how much she loves it,a great ereader
3.0,should have come with a charger cheapens product to be sold without one,three stars
5.0,absolutely love my kindle the size is perfect clear easy to read print quickly downloads your books upon purchasing etc while it would be nice if this one had a backlight for the rare lowlight reading occasionthe fact that it does not have a backlight is no big deal since most of my reading is done outside and at all other times in a well lit room great price so glad i made this purchase would totally buy it again,love my 6 glare free kindle
5.0,this was a great item for the money my first kindle and i am very happy,great kindle for the money
5.0,love it easy to use and glare free thats exactly how reading should be,five stars
3.0,was not what i really wanted send it back in exchange for the kindle fire,three stars
5.0,love it i especially love that i do not need to swipe or press a button to go to the next page all that is needed is a tap to the screen very lightweight for reading in bed and small enough to carry in my small purse thank you,kindle 6
5.0,great value ereader i have both this ereader and the kindle fire hd when i bought this one i wanted one that was a dedicated ereader without the backlight i used an earlier generation kindle prior to getting my kindle fire and this ereader i am very happy with this new generation basic ereader it does everything i want my ereader to do writing notes for research purposes is easy with the touchscreen and highlighting passages is very smooth as well very happy with this purchase,great value ereader
2.0,cheap plastic that wouldnt stick very well and bubbles no matter what i do,two stars
5.0,love it esay to use easy on the eyes can really get the print large if you need it love it bought 3 of them for christmas presents one was a present for myself after i got my hands on the one i ordered for husbands present we are enjoying them charges fast battery is holding so far easy on our older eyes 60s,love it great grandma has gone modern
5.0,no instructions had to try out very difficult dont anticipate is a geek,five stars
5.0,it does everything it was advertised to do i was using a 6 in fire to read books on but this is much better no glare longer battery life and it is much lighter than the fire for books you cant beat it,great reading tool
5.0,i lost my first kindal this is very nice and i like the lighted back ground,this is very nice and i like the lighted back
4.0,really love the display just like a page in a book with no glare from anything i like the weight and size of it and that you can just tap to turn the page i turned in my old keyboard kindle for a credit and then bought this one and i am glad i did i wish it had more options for customizing the home page but that is a minor detail,really love the display
2.0,need a bright lite to read and at its brightest this is still not adequate,two stars
5.0,i love the small size and the greater contrast my first kindle which i still have and use was a 2nd generation and i still love it too the only problem with my new one being a touchscreen it can be very sensitive and change more than 1 page at a time this does not happen often and i can easily deal with it the only time it is a real problem is when im reading and i start to fall asleep i can hit the screen in several places without realizing it and when i jerk awake i have to figure out where i need to go this one will be even easier to pack for vacation since it is smaller i love kindles including my kindle fire which i dont use for reading but i use it for lots of other things,i love the small size and the greater contrast
5.0,i couldnt expect for something betteri absolutely love this product,im in the reading heaven
5.0,this is the most perfect reading device better than my daughters ipad mini and my ipad no other device1 is readable in the sunlight2 is so lightweight you dont feel the weight in your purse3 has a battery thats lasts for weeks4 allows you to share books with family members5 is so inexpensive 59 ,kindle is the best device i purchased three one each for my family members
3.0,wish i can type chinese and listen to pronounciation as i can on kindle app,three stars
4.0,i am still trying to get the hang of my new kindle as i am not really computer or kindle smart it reacts really fast on changing pagestype size etc even when thats not what you want i am not use to having a touch screen on my kindle my original kindle which was a gift from my son and daughterinlaw because i read so much was given to me about 3 12 years ago i have the kindle fire which i use but preferred my kindle for reading i will admit the touch screen is giving me problems and i cant seem to find the new books i download i hope to get a handle on this sooner than later,touch screen troubles
5.0,love this kindle its small and it fits pretty much anywhere its awesome,great purchase
5.0,i had a kindle 6 but hated clicking the side buttons so decided to upgrade to the kindle touch didnt do kindle fire as i dont like the back light display for when i am reading love that the battery lasts longer especially since i am a habitual forgot to plug kindle in type of person i am so use to touch screens for all my other devices i am finding i actually use it more now than i did my previous kindle fits easily into my purse and accessories have been easy to find,happy onthego reader
1.0,i used to love my kindle until i realized that amazon does not really care about quality of user experienceit is very difficult to send feedback so if there is a problem with the way the system works a specific feature etc there is little recourse and it seems that amazon intentionally makes it hard to find there are lots of problems with the system read below for some examplesthe touch screen and lack of keyboard which makes typing slow and tedious is horrible and imprecise and i detest it i have sent amazon feedback and requested that they continue making the kindle keyboad but they have phased out all nontouch models anyway for many people a touch screen is just not a viable option and for me it is highly annoyinglike when i lean over and strand of my hair brushes the page and skips two chapters ahead completely losing my place in the book wtf making it extremely time consuming to get back to the page i was on without accidentally reading ahead and spoiling it it is especially horrible when that happens in books that have very long chapters or have sections and chapters and have been improperly formatted by the kindle system if dust gets on your screen or a hair or something that cant be blown off with a breath you will have to actually turn the kindle off to remove it or risk hopelessly losing your current pagethe kindle app for android is pretty bad too definitions are rarely displayed properly and when they are it is only the first few words so you have to click and wait for it to load the full definition if you actually want to see word origin or anything useful also the popup could be decent if you could then highlight a word within it and it would show the definition of that but there is actually no way at all to look up a word when viewing the definition of another word because things cannot be highlighted to view definitions from the page it takes you to it is infuriating and the only way that i can see to send feedback is to go through amazoncom and email or call from therethere are so many negatives and outright glitches that just dont get fixed but there is also a huge deficit of useful features that could be easily integrated into the system connection with google drive for example would be an excellent way to organize highlights and notes which are almost useless in the form that the kindle stores and displays themrecently my kindle has been telling me that i cant open more than half of the books that i have purchased from the kindle because they are registered to a different user and i am not looking forward to and dont have time to figure out why thats happeningi have been more and more disappointed with kindle over time but i hope they read this review and actually start trying to get on track again if they dont read this review then i hope google reads it and picks up the torch,heres to hoping they actually read this
5.0,i do kind of wish we could change the contrast and make it a little brighter but otherwise it is wonderful my visually impaired 6 year old has easily tripled the amount he is reading because of this device worth every penny,works like a charm
5.0,got this during the prechristmas sale great value for a nofrills kindle,great value for a nofrills kindle
4.0,i loved it but it died 1 day short of 4 months i hope they replacefix it,loved it but it died
1.0,this thing has a display thats a nasty greygreen it looks like something thats dying a slow death pictures are a foggy messi sent it back immediately avoid this piece of garbage,it looks like something thats dying a slow death
5.0,i loved mine but i returned it cause im going to get a kindle with built in wifi for anywhere book pick up i also couldnt really afford it at the time so i returned it but it is a good device i just wish that the kindle would make it good with a stylus and turn it into a journal notebook too,i loved mine but i returned it
4.0,i was used to the kindle touch this is ok just have to get adjusted to it,four stars
5.0,i got this kindle at a discount price it is really surprising me it is a very comfortable reading experience it is small and lightweight comparable to a paperback book the screen is not reflective at all i hated to bring heavy books when traveling this device saved me,it is a very comfortable reading experience
5.0,actually got wrong kindle wanted paperwhite but the kindle i have i love it,but the kindle i have i love
5.0,my only issues are i wish it had a light andor that the screen was just the smallest bit brighter i cant believe how light it is and downloading books on this is a thousand times faster than on a computer phone or tablet super fast i can easily sit on the couch or bed and hold it in one hand and my arm doesnt get tired for someone like me who wants to read but doesnt have the room in their home for large shelves or really wants to see what reading on an ereader is all about i would recommend this as a starter version if you find you really like it the more expensive versions would probably be the way to go on down the road,good starter
3.0,great for what it is only issues we have with it is there is no night light,three stars
2.0,this is a downgrade from the previous versionwhat you gain with the touchscreen is more than offset by the downgrade to a cheap plastic casing this kindle feels something you would buy because you cant afford a kindle and this lack of quality is not something you get used to i have been using this kindle for months and it still feels cheap to methe only thing preventing me from switching to the paperwhite which my wife uses and which is made of noticeably better materials is that the paperwhite does not allow you to completely turn off the screen lighting while you are reading if device lighting is not an issue for you buy the paperwhite if you are like me and do not want to stare into a lighted device at the end of the day wait a few months and hope that the next generation of the basic kindle is built to higher standards with better materials,cheap materials feels like a kindle knockoff
1.0,i thought it would be colored but it isnt so thats why i have it a one star,one star
5.0,great software features with goodreads integration the screen resolution is actually brighter even though the dpi remains at 167 like previous generations for an entry level reader this cant be best especially when on sale it gives you a lightweight and distraction free introduction to what reading should bea glare free minimally distracting reading experience that tablets and smart phones simply cant duplicate its very easy on the eyes and despite a plastic housing it feels well built the lack of a back light can easily and inexpensively be remedied by a plethora of cases with built in lights or led reading lamps its a great spare reader to have on hand for children too particularly when i dont want them to have my new voyage,great entry level experience at a fantastic value
5.0,fantastic i own 5 kindles n this addition is excellent for reading outdoors,another winner
5.0,i recived this for my birthday since i love to read i literally cannot tell you how awesome it is every single thing about it is a complete plus but there is two downfalls it is sometimes a bit slow and it also leaves a faded mark of the text if you go to a new page those minuses are not a big deal if youre not sure to buy it or not man up and do this device is great youll love itupdate oops go ahead and laugh at me i reviewed the wrong item i was reviewing the kindle paperwhite 2nd gen sorry guys,arguably the best reading device for a geat price
5.0,amazing like everything amazon does my boyfriend loved his birthday present,five stars
5.0,bought this to replace a stolen ipad mini obviously it isnt quite the same but it was so cheap compared to a new ipad mini that i decided to buy it i have been thrilled with the purchase i have loaded pdfs onto it to review some manuals for work depending on the quality of the pdf they can be pretty easy to read other pdfs are hard to read because their quality is so bad one thing i like is the option to turn it into landscape mode this thing is so basic i was not expecting that feature however this doesnt compare the the vast number of apps made for apple products if you want a tablet to use for more than just reading do not buy thisreading on this is so much better than the ipad my eyes dont hurt after reading for hours unlike my ipad mini retina display which would make my eye sight blurry for a little afterwardsthis kindle is super basic read other reviews but awesome i would recommend this for someone who wants to use it for reading,purchased to replace a stolen ipad mini retina
3.0,it is nice and light weight but there is no back light for night reading ,three stars
5.0,i bought this kindle to read outside it works great i have a kindle hd but it doe not work well on the beach this one does work outside and it weighs a lot less then the hd one i get to read out side in bright light without adjusting the brightness,perfect for outside
3.0,great for reading it shows ads when not in use which is a little annoying,three stars
5.0,this is probably the best thing ive ever bought i was against buying a kindle because i love having books in my hand but this is the lightest book ive ever carried and having multiple books is awesome i skip around from book to book so this is fantastic for me,this is probably the best thing ive ever bought
2.0,very cheep looking heavy no auto speakers and battery lasts about a week,not impressed
2.0,every word is not available on this product and i am disappointed with that, is not available on this product and i am disappointed with that
5.0,i love finally having a kindle for so many reasons i couldnt be happier with this device i dont really feel i need to go into great detail since there are so many highly detailed reviews here but i want to throw my two cents in i didnt think id love this thing as much as i do ok you convinced me my favorite things about it are public domain books the builtin dictionary feature vocabulary builder being able to read pdfs and borrowing from my library from the comfort of my couch,i love finally having a kindle
5.0,although the touch screen is a bit too sensitive ive accidentally changed the page by breathing on it like seriously what i love this kindle its got better storage than my old one did and its easy to find all my books i wish that the special offers on the lock screen would sometimes actually be something halfway aesthetically pleasing but i didnt buy it to look at the ads,it serves its purpose
2.0,i bought it because the old kindle i had did not have a working  home option any more it is smaller than i thought it is harder to use than i had hoped all the ads that pop up when you power it up are very annoying  i liked the looks of the screen in my original kindle much better  it was very easy to sync up with my old kindle i bought it because the old kindle i had did not have a working  home option any more i do not recommend this product to anyone there must be a better choice in the kindle product line out there ,all the ads that pop up when you power it up are very annoying i liked the looks of the screen in 
5.0,i had been borrowing my wifes kindle because i was having to use my ipad for other things and needed it to keep its charge up this kindle has taken a little getting used to but it still works a lot like my wifes older model,love my kindle
3.0,was disappointed in this for my purposes bought it as gift for elderly mother dont could be adjusted but screen could not be made brighter so she couldnt read with it customer service rep with amazon was fabulous she did the research recommended the paperwhite handled the return and replacement and its been perfect,was disappointed in this for my purposes
2.0,to hard to find the book i am looking for how can i list titles only difficult to find instructions the original kindle was much more usablewhat i need is complete instructions on line so i can make copies,to hard to find the book i am looking for 
5.0,love it,five stars
5.0,i never thought id buy one of these but because you had such a great price on black friday i bought one because some of the book i wanted were not out in paper the prices were so low on the first three books i bought it paid for the kindle, one of these but because you had such a great price on black friday i bought one because some 
4.0,the only thing that was disappointing is my case from my old kindle is to big,four stars
5.0,i love this for years i have been resisting getting a kindle i always love to feel and smell a good book but my husband eventually decided he knew better and got it for me anyway he was right i still love my hardbound books but the kindle is great for roadtrips and traveling i dont have to lug around a suitcase of books and new books are so much cheaper on the kindle store i love all of the features like highlighting or the inbook dictionary you touch a word and it defines it for you so much better than trying to remember what word you dont know that you wanted to look up overall just a great reliable product with extremely good battery life also the special offers dont bother me at all when my kindle is off it goes black but when i let it fall asleep theres a personalized offer on the screen normally about a new book or a case or something along those lines it doesnt drain the battery and i got free kindle unlimited for a month also it arrived very quickly,just a great product
3.0,i am still learning how to use it so my true answer will have to wait a while,three stars
5.0,nayant plus de place chez moi pour des livres jai été obliger de trouver une alternative jai commencé avec kobo et aujourdhui jai essayé kindle car il y avait des livres qui mintéressaient dont je navais pas accès quoi quil en soit je suis très satisfaite du kindle simple et rapide dutilisation je le recommande à tous les amoureux de la lecture et qui comme moi nont plus despace ou encore pour pouvoir emener partout des centaines de livres en un seul apprécier et profiter ,nhésiter pas 
2.0,i doesnt light up and cant be read in the dark without turning the light on,just buy a book
3.0,i purchased this kindle because the glare from my kindle fire hd was causing eye strain for the most part it is good as an ereader the major problems ive had are that sometimes the pages dont want to turn and i have to tap or swipe repeatedly other times i barely touch it and it will go forward or back several pages also its very slow compared to my kindle fire,it is good as an ereader
2.0,awkward to hold and any touch even a bedsheet can cause a page turn or two,two stars
4.0,nice though my aging eyes would appreciate a whiter background but im glad its not backlit size is fine the touchscreen is just a little bit unpredictable sometimes overresponding sometimes not responding i wonder if this has anything to do with cold fingers as this happens to me with other electronics too overall im pleased with this,nice though my aging eyes would appreciate a whiter 
3.0,i thought the background would adjust according to environmental light sources,three stars
5.0,this is fabulous i have been reading my kindle books on my ipad after looking at the computer all day at work though i didnt want to look at a computer screen anymore i finally decided to try this and it really feels like reading a regular paper book so much better than reading on my ipad,five stars
3.0,its a great starting kindle i just wish you could read it at night there are no back lights on this one so you cant see it without the lights on in the room and you can not put parental controls on what websites are allowed you can only have the internet on or off,great starter but not enough parental controls or backlight
4.0,all in all its a great ereader but i feel like it should have a backlight,good value
3.0,the product itself is lovely and exactly what i wanted for my daughter however im still really annoyedonly after i purchased this device did i find out that the freetime subscription which ensures your child wont be able to accidentally purchase content cant transfer public library materials already checked out to your device so if your child checks out digital materials from your local public library and wants to read them on your kindle they cant do it safely in freetime they have to read it from the home screen where they can access everything i suppose this is more a failing of the freetime software than the device but if that is the case why is that a kindlefire will allow this functionality why cant i have this function on my device90 of the reason i bought this kindle as part of the kindle for kids bundle is so that my daughter could easily access free library content im annoyed that in order to allow her to do that it appears i have to give her access to my amazon account im hoping to find another way than freetime or getting her her own amazon account to block my daughter from purchasing content but i havent found it yet and thats another problem im having with kindle the difficulty of finding answers to specific questions,beware freetime functionality for 7th generation kindle no library checkouts
5.0,this kindle is just the right size for me i also dont think that the screen is sensitive at alli find that i need to use a stylis to go to the next page i hope this helps in making someones decision to buy this new kindle easier,this kindle is just the right size for me 
3.0,so many adds i didnt realize if im not reading all you see is advertisements,too many ads
5.0,this was a surprise gift from a friend what a great surprise and i was reading a book as soon as i found one on amazon itwas quick to do and the kindle is very easy to read even with my 60 something eyes i do not even have a smart phone so thekindle was unexplored technology for me the kindle is a fun way to read books,what a great surprise and i was reading a book as 
5.0,i cant read but if i did know how to read this would be something i really enjoy,five stars
5.0,i have always enjoyed reading and this device makes it so easy to do the touch screen is effortless and direct access to the amazon store makes purchasing more books fast and convenient it is great for causal readers and avid readers also this kindle doesnt have a backlight but i prefer it that way since i stare at a computer screen and smart phone all day greatly recommend this product,love my kindle
5.0,exactly what i expected and more bought as a gift for my wife and she loves it,five stars
5.0,i love this device it has a dictionary that i can touch a word that i do not know the meaning of and it will give the meaning to me in a few seconds i like the lock page where i stop reading i am still learning about the device but i love it,smart reader
3.0,where is the option for adjusting brightness to be able to read in dim lighting,three stars
5.0,i already own a kindle fire which i adore in some ways however this device has some advantages over my fire its text is quite easy to read in nearly all all lighting situations it keeps a charge for a very long time and reading is more pleasurable to the eye on the kindle 6 i also seem to be able to read faster on this device i find it complements my kindle fire for magazines and books witch color illustrations i rely upon my fire for text only works like novels or short story compilations the kindle 6 is the device i prefer it was for me a quality product and a smart purchase,this is better than my kindle fire
5.0,i love this kindle it is so light in weight and easy on the eyes for reading,five stars
4.0,i have had a kindle fire for a while and always found it near impossible to use it in sunlight i love to read so suggested my husband bought me an ereader i received my reader a few weeks ago and took it on holiday to new orleans its brilliant i have carried it in my handbag all over the southern states its so light it adds next to no weight to what i was carrying i used it on the plane in the car by the pool it went everywhere with me it is so light you can use it with one hand you can adjust the font size to suit your needs it holds thousands of books which you can organise into categories authors the page turn is quick and easy with a light tap the battery lasts for many days weeks on a single charge all i can really say is it is what i have been looking for for a long time its the bees knee s,i love to read so suggested my husband bought me an 
2.0,no lighted screen for use at night doesnthave any download speed not a fan,two stars
5.0,i love all kindle products i have a kindle fire but this is really nice if you really want the reading a book experience having a device without a bright light while reading is easy on the eyes and comfortable the device fits perfectly in your hand and easy to tote along wherever you go,love kindle products
5.0,it was great i saved so much money there are free books on here too love it,um its amazing like yes
3.0,touch screen and software is much better than old version also resolution and refresh speed is superb unfortunately the material of the reader is quite a downgrade it is all made of plastic and feels cheap in my hands also the device is too thick for an ereader after using paperwhite and voyage i miss background light a lot its really cheap but i would not mind several extra bucks for better material and thinner design,much better software in inferior case
3.0,ok when reading under a lamp but it should be brighter in low light conditions,ok nothing special
5.0,got this on a promo for 29 and we love it my wife said in hindsight that we should have gotten more than 1 i wish it had the ability to read the book and had a light option but with this being the bottomend model it is understandable that some of the features had to be cut to save cost those items being missing werent deal breakers for us especially at the 29 price we paid if we were paying full price however id probably rather drop a few more dollars for the more featurerich paperwhite modelsi hope to one day see a fullcolor eink display in one of these lcd displays for bookreading gets the job done but it isnt ideal for some of the same reasons amazon teases the ipad for in their commercials its a bit silly considering amazon has a direct competitor with ipad with the kindle fire product line,great deal for the promo price paid
4.0,it is good but it could be better like the brightness needs to be brighter,four stars
5.0,its wonderful i like it very much it s easy to read with the light included,its wonderful i like it very much
4.0,love the size and weight even with cover easy to throw in purse and take with you only glitches for me is that the screen is a bit too dark and the pages a little tricky to turn if there is a way to lighten the screen please let me know,almost perfect
4.0,i bought this kindle for when i go to the beach or the park and find it hard to read on my kindle fire hdx due to the glare i like that it is small and can be carried easily i also like the touch screen feature its much better than my first kindle with the press button page turner,i like that it is small and can be carried easily
5.0,i am very satisfied with my kindle i can read easily in bright sunlight it is easy to use and performs just as advertised i do miss seeing my library in color as it is on my ipad but that in no way detracts from my satisfaction i will recommend this product without reservarion,i am very satisfied with my kindle
5.0,great product perfect for reading books and great for ordering and downloading,did not disappoint
5.0,am happy to have the kindle to use just as a reader i love my kindle fire but the screen for the hd is to hard to use outside since i spend a lot of time at the beach the new kindle is just perfect with its non glare screen and very light weight couldnt beat the price on it either,excellent choice
1.0,very disappointed the screen is much too dark terrible product waste of money,what a disappointment
5.0,i have always been a huge kindle fan started with a kindle fire 1st generation as a birthday gift from my college friends and now moved to a different direction with the kindle ereader its super easy on the eyes and feels as good as reading on real paper only complaint i have use that the edges easily catches dust other than that i can never put it down,its super easy on the eyes and feels as good as

5.0,this is the first kindle i have owned paperwhite i do nothing but read but setting outside with a nook or tablet was really a downer and because i do read all the time recharging the battery after a couple of hours was a chore i can read all day on the paperwhite and still have plenty of battery time left thank you kindle,the best thing ever
2.0,it worked fine its just that i didnt like the fact that it didnt have a light,it worked fine its just that i didnt like the fact 
4.0,darker words for more comfortable reading compare to kindle 3much easier control and page turnin in touch screenbut no sound no speech and seems no game activity either well the last one turn out to be a feature because kids will not be attracted to games when they are reading,darker words for more comfortable reading compare to kindle 3
3.0,im sure its a fine product but i wanted more i returned my for a kindle fire,three stars
5.0,if you love reading but cant seem to find the space or want a cheaper alternative to hard copy books this kindle is for you i believe this version is the best for its lightweight feel massive storage space and relatively cheap price the display isnt backlit like other versions but i really like this as it makes it seem even more like a regular book so do be warned if you want to read in darker lighting situations,perfect for bookworms
4.0,i like it useful and light i wish if it were colored so kids enjoy the books color,four stars
5.0,it took me a while to figure out how to use it because it works differently from previous kindlesbut once i learned how to use it it works great i love itsome have complained about you turn the page but when you think aboutthat is how you turn a page on a real book right to left with the same motionalso the clarity and battery life is excellent i dont need color or any of the features of a tabletbecause when i read a book i want just type in black and white with my imaginationthe philosophy and organization structure of how it is constructed is well doneworks for me bpysz,it works great i love it

4.0,i love kindle cant live without it so when my original kindle that was given to me in 2008 finally wouldnt work i was frantic as soon as the new one arrived my old one mysteriously started functioning again so now i have them both working and can really compare the functions i still prefer the old one with the keyboard at the bottom its easier for me to access the keyboard when i want to and not by accident as always happens with the new touchscreen kindle i like the smaller overall size of the new one but not enough to give up the keyboard of the original im constantly touching the screen by accident and then have to figure out how to get rid of it i know ill get used to it but its annoying to have to do so the lighter weight of the newer one is nice considering that the weight of books is the reason i tried the kindle to begin with i will eventually get used to the newer version dont see much difference in the readability of them,i love kindle cant live without it
3.0,cant get it to work right i have only been able to download the one book maude,three stars

5.0,excellent for curling up on a bed with i usually fall asleep reading books ,sleep readers go for it
5.0,a little strange to get used to at first after using my smartphone to read for a while but the kindle is really great in the long run the display technology is really really easy on the eyes since theres no backlight and its not led and really feels like youre reading a real book also i can literally download a hundred books whereas before i had to download read then delete a few at a time on my iphone the battery life is phenomenal and so far ive only charged it once the past three months i traveled around the country multiple times every week and its the perfect companion for airplane trips both long and short size is great too for travel and fits into most every bag also you can send pdfs of books to your kindle email address you get a unique one for each tablet when you buy one and they get automatically added to your kindle cloud already converted to the right format and ready for download all in all an amazing buy for those who love to read for pleasure and especially those who are trying to read more like me even on short bus or car rides i can whip this out and read for 10 minutes which is better than not reading at all in my busy schedule,great for all readers especially those who are trying to read more andor travel alot

4.0,would like to have more written instructions took eleven day for me to get my order,four stars
5.0,im an avid reader and a supporter of printed books but i really love my new kindle its light for carrying fits in almost any bag and its a great way to test novels for its worth if the book is so great worth buying in print and hold a place on my shelf then reading it on the kindle can help me assess that unfortunately there is some glue or something on the screen when i received it so now i have to return it and repurchase other than that everything about it is great i love the dictionary and i dont mind the ads theyre not very intrusive so id rather save the 30 to buy more books,great product im in love
2.0,screen is smaller than my old touch and it is thicker too a little weird,two stars
4.0,i have an older kindle that i like just fine but i always accidentally touch the buttons that turn the pages that is why i wanted the touchscreen kindle i do like that aspect of this kindle but i have the same problem touchy page turning is it me or is it my kindle,touchy touchscreen

5.0,great black and white ereader to use outside and inside no backlight for nightime reading which is fine for me as i have other readers but this one is so lightweight and easy to use the only initial concern i had was the special offers screen staying on all the time but i have gotten use to this and actually check out the offers when not reading,great black and white ereader to use outside and inside

3.0,preferred previous kindle with buttonsit seemed easier to use and it only comes with an adapter to charge from a computer fortunately my cell phone has an adapter that fits it seems smaller than the older kindlei am getting used to it,liked my old kindle
4.0,not a huge fan of the touch screen and it took getting used to but it works well it s easier to navigate but the touch screen can turn pages when youre not ready because its sensitive i was happy that it fit into my old case and wasnt significantly different in size good for the price,good for the price

3.0,had a couple older kindle models so my review is based on my personal experience and unfulfilled expectations from supposed to be the leader of ereader packpro screen contrast got better touch screen is no pun intended a nice touchcon the kindle case is chunky uncomfortable and awkward to hold you cant turn a page with one hand as with an older kindle by pressing on the side buttons the case made from a composite material which has worst texture feels compare with an older model may be kindle ergonomic department lost touch again no pun intended to what a nice book feels like to hold but this is just my take on itunknown havent check on battery life but dont expect much because the touch eink screen is an active device compare to a regular eink screenwish list lighter weight a little larger screen and softened with memory case would be attractive for my next purchasedisclaimer i waited and bought it for 50 from amazon so all my grumble were overweighted by 30 difference to a regular pricefor this price it is the best ereader on the us market,screen contrast got better touch screen is no pun intended a nice

5.0,loved my kindle keyboard but after only 3 years battery no longer holds charge frustrated the new kindle doesnt fit in my wonderful kindle keyboard leather case like the new kindle touch screen a lot but cases available were extremely disappointing only plastic hinge which is sure to tear with use doubles weight of the device and has no closure so can pop open that being said i dont like the touch screens way of cataloging books by their cover picture and would love a paper manual to be able to refer to doecific how to if you go on line its s blog of other users for instance how to organize books by author in chronological order of original publishing since i read a lot of series by same authors the device itself is functional and a good price,loved my kindle keyboard but after only 3 years battery 
5.0,love it,five stars

5.0,excelente,five stars
5.0,after reading some of the bad reviews i was nervous about purchasing this new kindle i recently broke my prior kindle recliner crunched it and was lost without it i purchased this new kindle and i could not be more happy with it i think that if you are already accustomed to electronics with touch screens this will be no problem one negative thing i found about this kindle is that the new one is made of plastic where the other one was metal i do believe that the older kindle felt better in my hand but i got used to this new one with no problems it would not stop me from buying it,love it
1.0,it a peice of dodo i wasted my 7000 dollars i never knew i had to pay more money to order the ebooks to me if i only knew that i had to pay more money you never would of had a sale of this kindle and i will waste anymore money on amazon,it a peice of dodo i wasted my 70
3.0,an older model was easier to handle this one has fewer places to hold it and its too easy to flip pages without realizing it then i have to hunt for my place since it can flipa single or multiple pages also i can change font but not space between lines it means to much white space more page turning and more opportunities for that inadvertent page flip to happen,not hand friendly
3.0,why dont i get the percentage read of each book i had it before with my other kindle,three stars
5.0,i have an older version which i liked but i love the touchscreen and it is so easy to navigate i thought about getting the paper white but i tried a friends and the light was a little to bright for me this fits the bill,great kindle for the price

4.0,other than not having a built in light i love it i just didnt buy the right one my bad,other than not having a built in light i love it i just didnt buy the right one
5.0,its obvious that a lot of thought went into designing the kindle it feels good in your hands its intuitive to use its super lighti love that it doesnt have a bunch of buttons just one small button on the bottomit comes with ads but they dont bother me it might even be a good way to discover books that i want to read although that hasnt happened yetits important to note that this kindle doesnt have a builtin light i didnt realize that when i bought it but now that i know i still would have chosen this one because the builtin light isnt worth the extra cost to me,love it
2.0,i got the device but didnt care for it i still love reading a book the old fashion way,i still love reading a book the old fashion way

5.0,i am so happy with my new kindle what i like most about the kindle is that i can read for an extended amount of time and it is so light that my my arm does not hurt unlike when i read with my nook or even a book i also like that you can skim through the pages and not lose your place these are just some of the things i love about the kindle but there are many more i would recommend this kindle as the 1 ereader,the best ereader

5.0,after a couple years of enjoying my keyboard kindle the time came for a new one at first i was disappointed that only the new touch screens were available but after using it for a few weeks ive come to love it i still havent learned how to use all the features but the basics down loading and reading a book were as easy as ever transferring the books i hadnt finished reading was so very easy too we recently moved to a rural area and with winter coming its great to know i can have something id like to read on my night table all the time,touchscreen wont disappoint

1.0,disappointment you cant load your own content if you have an ipad dont buy this one,disappointment you cant load your own content
2.0,i was very disappointed with my kindle i bought it so i could read my college ebooks and the kindle doesnt support the books i havent decided if i want to keep it for my fun books im not happy that my kindle ebook doesnt work with a brand new kindle,i was very disappointed with my kindle
3.0,ok if one wants to read mobi and only amazon tied stuff but not very versatile otherwise,three stars
4.0,only thing i dont care for is the fact that it doesnt work with the kindle lighted cover i already have for the original kindle touch price was ok and delivery was prompt i just do not want to spend more money on a light for it that is on me lthough the kindle works very well for what i use it for and is somewhat faster than the old kindle touch it is replacing,only thing i dont care for is the fact that 
5.0,got it in a day yay i am a bookworm and i love having a small device carry all my books,bookworm loves this kindle
4.0,great device with a lot of new features compared to my kindle i bought a couple of years ago i will say and this is just personal preference that i preferred the side buttons over the touchscreen i guess i just dont like getting finger smudges all over it other than that one minor grievance i love this thing it allows you to highlight passages and share them with friends via social media which i thought was very cool battery life is the same as ive always known excellent,love it
1.0,this product has not worked since i got it it doesnt accept charge and will not turn on,one star
5.0,just replaced a 2010 2nd generation kindle that died when i dropped it this is much lighter text is more clear and i really dont miss the 3g since it has wifi and theres no chance of me getting distracted form reading like i would on my phone or ipad if you want a basic reader and dont care about a backlight which i didnt want anyway then this works great,great for just reading
4.0,it is perfect for what i like reading out by the pool and such the price was perfect too,thevperfect outdoor reader glare free wifi compact size
4.0,this version is still clearer greater ppi and lighter than the last one i got i was too cheap to go for the 300ppi version though graphics remain a challenge the concept of collections is nice but difficult to use i can only move content between collections using the kindle instead of providing other means such as the web where a mouse and keyboard would be handy or better yet the kindle ui could be improved seriously thinking of not using the collections idea until its easier to manage,the concept of collections is nice but difficult to use
3.0,good little kindle for the price i got such a good deal from amazon i couldnt resist it,kindle 6
4.0,i got the cheapest version of the kindle 6 which it is not advertising free nevertheless the reduced price i paid for the device it is worth it the advertising is barely noticed it comes only on the screen saver and even though the instructions state that there might be advertising at the bottom of the device while reading i really didnt notice it since i started reading my favorites books several weeks agoenglish is not my tongue language as you can notice while reading my review so the vocabulary builder is totally useful i do not give to the device the fifth star because it doest come with a speaker to take advantage of the texttospeech feature,it really worth the price i paid for it
3.0,bought a book but cannot get the complete book how long does kindle have to be charged,bought a book but cannot get the complete book 
3.0,it was a christmas gift for my mom exactly what i needed i just need to find a case for it,it was a christmas gift for my mom exactly what 
5.0,reading on this is so easy it looks just like a book but i can read in much lower light,exactly what its supposed to be
2.0,this kindle although advertised as having a bright screen it cannot be used in subdued light without buying a book lighti like to read in bed and unlike a kindle fire even with a bedside light this screen is too dim amazon says i should have bought a kindle voyager which is considerably more money my advice to potential buyers is verify all product claims and remember you get what you pay for or in this case what you thought you were paying for,cannot be used in subdued lighting without a book light
3.0,my 13 yr old daughter ordered this to use it works well for reading as long as there is light unfortunatey it doesnt have a built in light for when its dark weve never used an ereader and found it difficult to understand how to download a book not from amazon also i was not able to figure out a way to set up an account for her under my account i dont like that it suggests books to her based on books i have read i do like that it does not have a browser or games we will be returning it and getting the one that has a built in light,good but no built in light
2.0,was stoked about this but within the first two weeks of use it has already started to do weird buggy things like freeze jump around randomly when i havent touched anything or not respond when i do click something the same thing happened to my last kindle but at least it lasted for a few years before crapping out,buggy
3.0,there was insufficient information on your question to help determine a responsible answer,three stars
3.0,its great and works great but its just way to touchy i barely sweep my hand by it and it turns the page or it changes the font cant leave it in my purse because something will touch it if its trying to mimic a real book it has failed horribly,leave the touch screens for the tablets not a book
3.0,cant read in the darkso returned with no issue and the kindle fire is much much better,so returned with no issue and the kindle fire is much much better
5.0,i hate reading on a computer screen so i wasnt sure if i would like an ereader but this thing is great the white background is easy to see even with my lessthanperfect vision and you hold it like a book so its much easier than reading on a laptop im an amazon prime member and i joined kindle unlimited so all my books are basically free there was nothing to do to set it up except to turn it on im really looking forward to taking it with me on my next trip so i dont have to carry big heavy books on the plane,love this thing
2.0,i have an original kindle i was disappointed in this small version my mistake,i was disappointed in this small version
5.0,this was a prize in a giveaway and my first kindle i am just starting to read on it and everything seems to look good i have downloaded two other prize books that i won and several free ones that i wanted to sample they downloaded faster than i could read the page i was downloading from quite impressive i found the directions pdf downloaded and printed it quite easily i will be signing up for the kindle unlimited feature as it is an affordable expense for budget conscious people like me the unit was easy to charge and as the basic unit it has everything except for being selflit but i find reading it under a light is easy to try out new technology at an affordable price this is the unit to get,i am just starting to read on it and everything seems looks good i have downloaded two other prize books that 
3.0,i thought it had a night reading light so i was alittle disappointed but overall i like it, had a night reading light so i was alittle disappointed but overall i like
2.0,im a kindle 2nd generation lucky to still have it person i purchased and returned the glarefree touchscreen because i missed the keyboard and voice to text features somethings in the kindle features should never be taken away those for me were the reasons i kept the 2nd generation kindle and returned the new love the newer technology miss the keyboard and voice to text put it back,2nd generation kindle lover

5.0,great little reader i got it for my husband so he could read at the beach and out in the sun his kindle fire which he loves did not allow that it is light responsive and just a fun little device it does come with advertising on the start page which i wish i could get rid of thats my only complaint,great llittle reader
5.0,arrived quickly easy to use have had no problem downloading my books from my pc,easy to use
2.0,i find the touchscreen kindle very annoying if you put it down and anything touches it the font size will change i find the way to change pages touching one half of the screen to be very annoying as well i miss my old kindle,touchscreen is annoying
3.0,great for easy reading however theres no backlight so reading in darker areas is difficult,three stars
5.0,i ducking love it i have always been a reader but the high cost of books left me with only a free metro in my hand and a new book maybe twice a month now with this kindle and the kindle unlimited subscription service i have a multitude of assorted things i can read for only 999 a month i kind of feel like that guy in that one twilight zone episode except people are around to fix my glasses and my prescription is so low that if my glasses ever break it will only be a minor inconvenience,i ducking love it i have always been a reader but 
2.0,for the price it wasnt to badhowever if it had the light bulb feature it would be awesome,for the price it wasnt to bad however if it had the light bulb feature 
4.0,this kindle is easy to use and all that i expected of it and more the more part is the advertising that is on the the kindle every time you shut it off when turning it on you have to swipe the advertisement so it goes away i own the kindle now and should not have to see ads every time i want to use my own kindle,this kindle is easy to use and all that i expected of it 
3.0,this item was great my daughter opened it at her birthday dinner and was able to use it immediately it arrived already charged very nice but i got this with the understanding that there would be a 2year warrantee that comes she is 8 and im worried it will break at some point i understand the warrantee is very good but i dont se any indication that i actually got the warrantee the description when i placed it in the cart said that the warrantee was in the bundle with the cover but now all i see is the kindle and the cover do i have the warrantee if there is a problem whom do i contact,warrantee in the bundle or not
4.0,now that i am getting used to it i find i am reading a lot more than i used to read and i like that change i am not a technogeek a wall phone is fine for me the kindle is handy especially since i dont need to carry a bunch of books on vacations but it did take me a bit of time to get used to the touch screen technology an 8 page printed leaflet giving basic explanations and howto hints would have been nice luckily 15 minutes with my neighbor gave me the same information,and i like that change
5.0,great ereader for the price the only problem i can say i have with it is a minor one it has so little internal storage about 4gb i think it is perfect for reading my manga on it too just dont expect color on the color pages still the images and font is beautiful,perfect for manga
1.0,i didnt realize it didnt have a back light i think the description should be more detailed,one star
5.0,light weight and easy to read set up is not as easy as you claim because you are not clear in your instructions it merely says password not everyone is 100 computer literate or has a 3 year old in the house it would be good if you specified that the password refers to the wifi password that is found on the router when i first tried to connect the kindle it would not work i had to reset the kindle and the modem then it worked perfectly but i wasted time trying passwords trying to figure out why the kindle was harder to set up than and ipad,light weight and easy to read
4.0,does everything i needed only problem is the battery not holding a charge very long on games,kindle 6
5.0,i give 5 stars to this reader on the basis of what it is in itself standing on its own without comparison to a paperwhite reader this is a great basic reader with 4gb of storage and a really crisp reading screen its perfect outdoor under sunlight and looks very clear and easy to read with average indoor lighting average indoor meaning not sitting next to a lamp no its not paper white in appearance but then i knew that buying it so im not going to complain about that i previously had the kindle keyboard back in 2010 and the letters and words on the current basic kindle looks far crisper and defined i like the touch interface on this also far better than the kindle keyboard and very responsive pages turn quickly and i love the page flip feature where you can look ahead without losing your place lack of that was very frustrating with my previous kindle and made it a real drawback in place of holding a physical book the extra features are numerous on this device to much so to go into every one of them but suffice to say that if you read and stay hooked into wifi you can hook into wikipedia for more information on what your reading and you can also share passages or highlights to your facebook page all additions over my previous kindle without losing any of the previous features i already liked about it i can say more but why all of this is tucked into a device that i only spent 7900 on its a great dedicated basic reader,this is a great basic reader with 4gb of storage and a really 
5.0,this was a replacement for a kindle that would no longer connect to the wifi it works fine,replacement kindle
4.0,ive got this kindle reader for my birthday but unfortunately had to return it to amazon since it did not meet my expectations for this kind of a gadget ill continue using my ipad for the kindle app since its easier to read in a dark place if i wouldnt have a tablet then this kindle may work for me but it doesnt make sense to have another device which is not better than my ipad,good book reader but my ipad wins
2.0,guess i did not understand the only thing i can do is books thought i coyld do games as well,guess i did not understand the only thing i can 
5.0,my kindle was a gift and i enjoy it so much its light in weight which i especially enjoy using when i purchase an authors hard cover book andthe screen is glare free meaning reading with it doesnt bother my eyes or interfere with my sleep,and i enjoy it so much
4.0,it only takes the wifi of my home when i am outside school work it doesnt want to work,it only takes the wifi of my home when 
5.0,it took me a long time to get around to buying a kindle but im really glad that i finally did print size and clarity are about like a trade paperback but it is much easier to hold and the page turns are effortless and practically instantaneous i can read much faster on the kindle and it is very convenient to be able to look up unfamiliar words on the fly it was on sale when i bought it so that made the deal even sweeter,i am very pleased with my kindle
3.0,with no light on the screen it is sometimes hard to read the book reviews on advertised books,three stars
5.0,the first time the package is gone i looked for it for two weeks but still cant find it and then i made a call to customer service they fixed it immediately and i got my new package in one daynice shoppingbut i dont know why a book has in my kindle alredy since i did not buy itmay someone took my first package and used my id to buy a book called cow boyi am a little confused of this,nice shopping but i dont know why a book

5.0,man was i wrong about this thing i ate a sandwich and read a book what a world we live in,oh my gosh
5.0,i never had a book reader before but was tired of the clutter of book around the house i knew this book didnt have a backlight but i didnt care since i live alone and dont plan on reading in the dark its very basic but thats all i needed it connected fast to my wifi downloaded my first book quickly keeps a charge for a long time is simple to use and i couldnt be happier with it not only that but i got a 70 credit for getting an amazon credit card and my kindle its case and first book only cost me 15 which went on the credit card i highly recommend it,highly recommend
5.0,great buy quality is excellent price is really low compared to other options and the only important feature this model doesnt have is adjustable light ie you cant read without external light this model is not hd but it doesnt really matter since you can always make the font bigger,excellent buy
1.0,ive sent this kindle back for credit didnt appreciate this one as much as my other kindles,not well received in comparison to my two other kindles
5.0,i bought 2 of these for my kids they love themthey are both reading a lot more and really enjoy itthey were a little disappointed that i didnt get them the fires but theyll survive maybe next time,my kids love theirs
3.0,this does not have the ability to brighten your screen so if you want that order a paperwhite,good for basic reading but pay extra and get the paperwhite
2.0,i originally bought the kindle because it had a headphone jack and text to speech capability im disabled and cant read normal text the battery recently tried to self destruct so i was sent a new kindle turns out that the new models no longer have headphone jacks or text to speech capability so i now have to pay for an ebook pay extra for the audio feed if it is available and then borrow my kids smartphone so i can listen to the book the new kindle is a paperweight way to go backwards in accessibility for the handicapped amazon,not handicapped friendly
4.0,i like it it works well and theres nothing wrong with it just never use it thought i would,i like it it works well and theres nothing wrong 
2.0,very dim display i was aware that it doesnt have a light but the display is akin to reading a book printed with dark grey ink on a light grey page theres very little contrast between the background and the eink it takes more light to read on this thing that it does to read a standard paperback,very dim display
4.0,the only thing i dont like is that i cannot transfer games like every word to my new kindle,cannot download games
5.0,i bought this for my 87 year old mom for christmas yes i have had to help her to learn how to use it but this has been a blessing for her her eyesight is failiing and she has always loved reading  she pretty much gave up because she couldnt read the print well now we can adjust the font size and the screen is easy for her eyes to read im happy to say she has read six books in january and she loves her kindle she calls it her machine lol it makes me smile seeing my mom enjoying reading again thanks kindle and she is learning and figuring it all out,love lovelive

5.0,my daughter got this as her birthday present and she loves it she is thrilled to have a portable device to read books where ever we go im still trying to figure it out but she is a pro now the one thing i havet discovered yet is if there is a way to control the brightness sometimes it seems very dim otherwise glad we purchased this,great birthday present for my nine year old
3.0,received as a gift should have returned for the paperwhite that i was going to buy for myself,buy the better one
3.0,i do enjoy reading books off this kindle but two things are very annoying it is advertised as having a longlife battery not needing recharging for weeks it last about 4 days consistently for me no i dont read all day it takes at least a couple hours recharging off the computer also this has no backlight for reading in very low light it seems like a nobrainer to me to have a backlight of some sort otherwise i like it,not a longlife battery
3.0,miss the page controls and the edges over sensitive to touch moves content before i am ready,three stars
5.0,fabulous ive been really resistant to an ereader but the sale on this one tempted me its perfect i dont find the issue with the power button that others have referred to and the touch screen doesnt seem hypersensitivethough it didnt come with a wall charger we have a computer that can charge it as well as several other usb wall chargers for phones and stuff so it really hasnt been necessary to purchase a special onethrilled with the product and glad i finally caved i use it mostly for library books and the kindle first offerings and the download is seamless,its perfect i dont find the issue with the power 
2.0,it was uncomfortable on my eyes i am returning it nice size and weight but ill use my ipad,soso
1.0,vastly inferior to previous version cannot use with a cover that has a reading light built in,disappointed

5.0,technical review for the kindle paperwhite i refurbish old furniture for a living and my kindle reads to me while i do so ive killed many a kindle 10 to be exact and yet i still stand by the little guys why because i have concrete floors in my shopenough said for the poor kindle i drop on it several times before it breaks ive never had one to break because of technical error only my user error dropping it on the concrete floor so now that you know every kindle i order shakes in its packaging to be delivered to my shop lets get down to business the only weakness ive been able to find with this kindle is the screen or what is under it to be precise its glass and if you drop it just right it shatters underneath the plastic top cover making your kindle unreadable but still working ive broken the screen and continued to have it read to me until a new one could be delivered thats the only weakness the case is made of plastic hard and durable if you buy a cover for it i recommend that so you dont scratch the plastic screen if you decide to carry it with you in your purse or briefcase it is like a mini laptop in a sense you have to protect the screen next the button version of this paperwhite is easy to push a little small for your fingers but doable after you learn the ropes of what to push and when the touch version is better and easier for a child or senior who has not so steady hands it is easy to learn how to work a kindle my child age 5 when i got my first kindle ended up showing me how to work it everything is at the touch of a button or fingertiptheres no complicated programs or adding or removing things if you want to connect to wifi to buy a book push a button and it takes you there that simple your amazon account is how you pay for a book and because you had to register your kindle all you have to do is click the buy button and it downloads onto your kindle in less than 30 seconds i was in the grocery store last week and downloaded a new book at a football game at the doctors officeyou get the idea anywhere this thing has the best wifi connection ive ever seen i live in the sticks of mississippiwhen i say the kindle can download anywhere i mean anywhere in the middle of the wilderness on a four day camping trip down the natchez trace couldnt even stump my kindle paperwhites ability to download a book for me the app that allows you to listen while the kindle reads to you it takes getting used to the robotic voice but its a nice feature to have when your hands are full or busy doing other things overall i give this device five stars,the kindle paperwhite is worth the money if you need a simple to use reader
1.0,i have to admit that i really do dislike this new kindle i am hopeful that it is just the issue of having to adjust to something new but i like my old generation kindle with the buttons i hope amazon reads these reviews and takes their loyal customers into consideration i got lucky and my old kindle started working outside of the case it never had an issue before but the case seems to be affecting the battery life as well as the general function of the kindle i have had that case for 4 years and it was never an issue before if it continues to work i will reserve this new kindle as an emergency kindle otherwise i hope i never have to use it,i have to admit that i really do dislike this new kindle
5.0,i have only one major problem with the kindle and amazon because they put that drm digital restriction management on all their e readers this means i can not transfer my ebooks from my very old reader to the kindle because kindle does not support epub the most commonly used program for ereaders i love my kindle and i will continue to shop amazon im just a little disappointed that kindle doesnt support epub i have now owned my kindle for a few months now i love it at this price i just bought a kindle for my daughter you will need to buy a ereader clip light there is no backlight on this kindle but the ereader clip light works great books download pretty fast my old ereader i had to use my computer to download ebooks a pain in the butt  with the wifi on my kindle one click and i have my ebook  im still disappointed about kindle not supporting the epub i have ebooks on my old ereader that i would love to transfer to my kindle i cant because they are in the epub format im looking for a program so i can convert my epub books so far no luck as im finding out it is because of that drm kindle has as far as the special offers on the kindle the only time i see them is when i turn my kindle on so no problem there i do highly recommend this kindle,a little disappointed
3.0,kind of crappy that amazon charges an extra 40 dollars for a backlit screen but it does the job,three stars
4.0,i had a kindle 2 for years until the battery died and wouldnt recharge anymore when i upgraded to this new device it took a while to get used to the touch screen feature but ive grown to like it im satisfied with it and felt it was a good value,made a generational leap
3.0,i wanted it to play crossword puzzle games and discovered that it did not work for that purpose,three stars
1.0,this is without a doubt the worst kindle i have ever used this is my seventh kindle it is so poorly designed that it is almost unuseablethe activation button onoff switch is on the bottom of the device if you try to hold it with one hand you are constantly turning the device off non of the settings hold in the course of one hour of reading i have to reset the font size at least 5 times it wont hold the page advance touch screen is so course that you either dont get a page advance or you turn multiple pages the kindle tools appear at random when you least expect them the location in book settings dont hold usually they reset or turn off while you are reading my overall rating of this device is piss poor i would rather have my old basic kindle to use at least when you set it up the settings stayed where you set them i wasnt a constant battle to keep reading,6 kindle touchscreen display is pi poor
2.0,hard to read screen i expected a brighter display should have gotten the more expensive model,hard to read
5.0,ive wanted a kindle since the day they were released but way back then you couldnt load library ebooks onto them now though im getting a free book every month as a prime member and can load whatever books i wish onto it i was planning to get at least the paperwhite but this one was 50 on prime day so i went for it im very very pleased text is easy to read and the transition from page to page is pretty good too theres a nice tutorial that walks you through the basics as soon as you turn it on and its small and light enough that i can hold it in one hand comfortably ill get one with a backlight in the future but the base model is fine and the special offers arent annoying like i expected them to be ,very pleased text is easy to read and the transition 
3.0,troubles in the beginning with setting up on my wifi but was able to after having for two weeks,three stars
4.0,now that i’ve discovered that the pdf articles can be read in landscape mode i like this kindle i do wish however that memory can be expandable through a micro sd card or similar overall this is a good basic reader with a very efficient battery,i like this kindle
5.0,as always the amazon kindle is the best reading device i have ever owned this is my kindle 4,the amazon kindle is the best reading device i have ever owned
5.0,my husband loved his christmas gift it has everything you could possibly need and more for an e reader this one is touch screen to change the pages the books download so quickly in wifi i am probably going to by myself one as well,love this product
5.0,enjoy using it very much lightweight easy to turn pages would like a few free books tk,kindle glare free
3.0,this kindle was given to me as a gift on retiring to a new state i never had a device like this before i can read easily off a 15 inch computer screen but the small format is hard for me my eyes and reading comprehension dont seem to adjust well to this format perhaps you should borrow someones ereader to try out before buying one for your self or asking for it as gift maybe i will adjust to the format over time,i never had a device like this before
4.0,i love the little kindle love the screen technology the battery seems to run for ever i dont like the ads specially on the lock screen but i figured out that by turning off wifi the ads were gone well they do appear outside in the library but those dont bother me also notice i erased the entire thing first great buy,love the little kindle just dont use the wifi
4.0,i like some of it but i dont like the touch screen i would have preferred the buttons on the side,i like some of it but i dont like the touch 
3.0,difficult to navigate i will try later to figure out the operation when i have more time to waste,i will try later to figure out the operation when i have more time to waste
4.0,it takes some getting used to likeprefer being able to look and click through a list of the books i have in the kindle rather than looking at pictures of the cover one assumes that if you have a kindle you know how to read and dont need pictures,it takes some getting used to likeprefer being able 
3.0,would be 5 stars but it would be nice if you could turn up the light or have a night reading setting,would be 5 stars but it would be nice if you could turn up the light or have 
4.0,small lightweight touch screen makes this a pleasure to use because the item is able to share the books that i carry in my ipad cloud my wife and i can read the same book at the same time easy to carry saves me when i need to have reading material on hand when sitting waiting for appointments,easy reading
1.0,not very responsive and i do miss having a built in light for nighttime reading would recommend a kindle but i would not recommend this version,not impressed
4.0,it is very sensitive to the touch which takes getting use to i do not like word wise it is almost an insult to your intelligence that you do not know the meaning of the words they pick to give the definition of maybe there is no glare in the sunshine but there is a glare when sitting in a chair with a lamp otherwise i do like it,i do not like word wise
2.0,i was not able to enter my credit card number do still unable to use my kindle little frustrating,i was not able to enter my credit card number 
5.0,i love my kindle and use it everyday that said i spend a good time of the day reading books too so i thought buying a 6 glarefree would be a great way to spare my kindle charge i am so glad i did i love the size of this device and the fact that it travels so well and can be used outdoors the new print display works really well in all venues and i love being able to carry my library around with my wherever i go,loving this

5.0,i love it its very compact and reads just like a book battery life is amazing i really wish they made ceases with built in lights they did for the kindle touch but not this one the book light is way too bulky and ruins the portability of this kindle,love it
2.0,very dark its hard for my eyes to adjust not very happy after i paid extra for fast delivery,dislike
5.0,the first time i used a ereader was this product and i was simply amazed at how portable books had became the idea of carrying thousands of books with you is a huge advance over hand held books though i will always love the feel of a new book which this can not capturethis device lets you read with no glare while sitting on the porch or at the beach it of course is extremely portable not just because of size but because one charge lasts me so long i never have really tested how long because i always toss it onto a charger every few days just as a habitthey say it lasts weeks and i surely do believe that i use this along with kindle books unlimited one of the bests investments for any reader that is available i read at least 6 books a month minimum that i find on there that interests me it is a great investment to use with this i also love the fact is plays a few basic time using games on here like sodukoi honestly have no complaints about this purchase even though i made it several years ago it is still working great i purchased this when it first came out to release i do not know even what year it was it has been so long agoi never have had a issue with keeping it charged or installing books or connecting to wifi durability is out of this world,a purchase that has lasted me for years
2.0,says it is glarefree but it is not really cannot use at the beach and that is why i bought it,says it is glarefree but it is not really 
4.0,i previously owned a kinde fire hd but i wanted a kindle that i could read books on and not be distracted but other features it does what i need it to do i do miss having the backlight otherwise im fine with it it would be nice to have a feature to brighten the screen even just a tiny bit,no backlight but still great
3.0,i hate this product the screen keeps flickering when you turn the page or go to home or library im definitely returning it but to be fair i think this would be a good option if you like sitting outside and reading like sitting in the patiobalcony and its supposed to be awesome when youre sitting outside in the sun and reading but i hate sitting outside and i avoid the sun i do most of my reading while sitting in semidarkness so this product is not good for me because the screen is too dark for reading in these scenarios im giving it a 3 and not a 2 because i believe i may not be the typical target for this product im thinking of getting the kindle paperwhile instead,i hate this product
5.0,easy on the eyes easy to read lots of books to choose from and good prices has enough features like changing font size lightweight and easier than carrying books around so quick and easy to add booksperfect for reading,easy on the eyes
4.0,i like this of course i did not take time to read the the handbook that you must see on line or kindlei purchased this to read books i wish this had a light however i did not think of this needi did not see other choices on amazon page where i purchased i am not a cyber person so those questions were not of my then conce,purchased to read books
2.0,most of the time this device works okay but once in a while it turns several pages in just one touch,touch screen too sensitive
4.0,this is my first kindle and i am quite pleased with it it is pretty easy to use and navigate and great to read outdoors i wanted something that was very light and just a reader the ads are not even an issue the minute you start up they are gone if you dont want a lot of bells and whistles and just want to read this is a great little machine if you want to read in the dark next to your sleeping partner this is not the one,this is my first kindle and i am quite pleased with it
4.0,first time kindle user it s ok kids like it only wish it had light cant see anything in low light,kids like it only wish it had light cant see

5.0,enjoying the kindle the glare screen and dust protector are not easy to use i have a lot of bubbles,bubbles still seem
4.0,this is my first ereader i wasnt sure if i would like this as i like having a physical book in my hands much to my surprise i like my kindle touch the text is easy to read indoors or out the convenience of having multiple books in one small space is so nice imagine carrying dozens of books in your purse or backpack and not hurting yourself lol all in all a positive experience,i wasnt sure if i would like this as i like having a physical book in 
4.0,really nice ereader but in my opinion the previous version had a better shape to hold with one hand,great but
5.0,the kindle is everything it was advertised as it size is very comfortable in the hand and ordering books is easy ive also been able to upload my own material to it via the micro usb plug ive found that some of the lighting in my house is dim which makes it harder to read on the kindle if you read in a dimly lit area you might want to go up a level and order the kindle paperwhite that has the builtin light overall i am very happy with this kindle,the kindle is great
3.0,good product next update may allow screen rotation and built in light with option to turn on and off,good product next update may allow screen rotation and 
3.0,screen too sensitive to touch changes multiple pages unintentionally,screen too sensitive to touch changes multiple pages unintentionally 
3.0,its a nice unit the radiation is more reduced than the kindle fire the fire had to be sent back as it was just irritating so far this kindle unit is somewhat irritating the unit works great and its fun from that point of view the screen is non glaring so that works well but as far as radiation and emf kindle needs to do some more research on reducing it down the barnes and noble nook base version i am speaking about does not bother me at all so what is that manufacturer doing that kindle is not doing,nicer than the fire for radiation and emf
4.0,my old kindle was easier to figure out but i love the size and screen miss my 49 page lists of all my books not liking all the pictures really not necessary amazon service wa great the return of the defective kindle super easy thanks to sophia,but i love the size and screen
4.0,it would be great if it had a lighted background so you could read in bed without putting a light on,it would be great if it had a lighted background so you could 
3.0,i had the basic kindle and really liked it so was surprised and disappointed when receiving this one that its not as userfriendly i thought the touchscreen was going to be great but sometimes it turns back to the previous page and it sometimes takes a while to turn its also not as easy to purchase books from the device so i wait until i can get in front of the computer to do so the light for my other one was built into the cover but the only lights ive seen available for my new one sets above the kindle if i fell asleep reading with my old one the light would automatically shut off after so long and it wasnt in the least cumbersome i havent bought a light for my new one as im not sure that im going to keep it very disappointed,i had the basic kindle and really liked it so was surprised and disappointed when receiving this 
3.0,very hard for me to get up and running initially why do i need this when i have kindle on my laptop,very hard for me to get up and running initially 
4.0,my mother loves to read though in recent years shed fallen away from it time convenience etc so naturally being a kindle lover myself i own a former generation with the keyboard i thought this would be a great gift for her and was able to get a great deal on it during black friday this yeari dislike the idea of having ads on the kindle relevant or not but appreciate amazons willingness to make the kindle more affordable than previous models by having the option for ads which you can pay 20 at anytime to remove if you so choose this kindle is exceptionally more modern than my kindle keyboard and was significantly less expensive thats a win no matter how you look at iti found the size of it on christmas morning a huge improvement over my kindle it is small and lightweight yet the screen itself is much crisper and more responsive than my own the only thing i can fault it with is that the black plastic looks and feels a little brittle and cheapi helped my mom set it up which was easy enough to do and youre given a brief tutorial upon getting to the home screen for the first time a lot of the basic concepts from my kindle carried through to this kindle love the touch screen and the mini cover displays on your home screen book shelf however i really wish amazon would give a startup guide in paper form with the kindle the user guide on the device itself isnt ideal to learn from and ive had to field several questions from my mother since walking her through it on how to do something i would argue that despite the better features especially the ability to click a characters name in a book and be given a biography on them its a little less user friendly than previous versions im 29 years old and the learning curve took me a bit even being a seasoned kindle usereven in light of a few minor annoyances i plan on buying one of these for myself soon the size and speed of this model will be a great upgrade to my kindle keyboard and i absolutely love the ability to borrow kindle books from my local libraryi worry a bit that my mother wont fully utilize her kindle based on the confusion shes had with the interface but like everything else in life practice makes perfect i have some grievances with the user interface of this kindle but its not enough to dissuade anyone from purchasing it and it remains the best ereader on the market and for good reasonmy advice to potential buyers is to save 20 by buying the version with ads theyre relatively unobtrusive and many cases have functionality to auto turn onoff the device when the cover is opened so it makes the ads even less noticeable use that 20 to invest in your first few books and if you find the ads too much to deal with you can go to amazon and pay to have them removed just my 02,improvement to previous models with a few exceptions
5.0,great to travel with light weight and easy to readso glad i made the jump from paper to the kindle,great to travel with light weight and easy to read
1.0,i love the kindle my rating should be 5 stars but i couldnt figure out how to change from 1 star,i love the kindle
2.0,i was expecting to read at nights with the bedside light out the screen was dark too harsh on my eyes,i was expecting to read at nights with the bedside 
5.0,you cant read on an ipad its too heavy sync with audiocom is fabulous between workouts and kindle,light weight and so easy
4.0,love this touch screen had the old version with the button commands will never go back didnt want to pay the extra for the backlight model plus it had some bad reviews and this one works fine for my needs i suggest you get some sort of case to protect the screen from accidental scratches,this is a fine version of kindle for less money than other models
3.0,was replacing my kindle that would not charge anymore didnt realize this reader wasnt similar because i ordered in a hurry so i could finish my book it s nice lightweight like reading paperback but i prefer the tablet fire i recently purchased now i dont use this reader,not what i wanted
4.0,just what i expected from the latest generation this is my first reader i was waiting until the price came down and they got the fundamentals right this is the one yeah you have to put up with it displaying an ad on the lock screenbut so what i saved 20the screen is very readable the fonts are scallable downloads are quick and simple and the device itself is comfortable in the handit would be perfect if this were the paperwhite version with the backlight for this price and if all books could be had for the deep discounts ive found on a few books like 199,just what i expected
2.0,i cant register my new kindle because of an internal error and cant figure out who to contact hello,internal error
5.0,my first kindle is ancient but still works though the letters on the buttons are difficult to read now my 8 year old grandson finds it useful what i like best about this newer version is the more compact size which is barely noticeable in my purse also the touch screen glad i made the switch,updated my kindle 
3.0,a little disappointing since the screen cant be backlit you cant use it in dim lightning conditions,only good in daylight conditions
2.0,the touch screen is too sensitive one tap often scrolls 23 pages the on button is too small i liked my old kindle better,i liked my old kindle better
3.0,got this for a trip and it is convenient but im used to an ipad and color images its very limited,got this for a trip and it is convenient 
5.0,this was my second kindle after having a seller refurbished unit from another website die amazon couldnt replace it but offered a reduced price replacementthe kindle came with everything but its original box and manual but from previous usage i was able to fire it up and get it running there was a digital guide already on the unit that helped to reacquaint with the features which was nicethis kindle uses a screensaver when powered off and i was skeptical of the battery draining from this but three weeks later it still had battery power and worked greatthe touch features are excellent the screen registers each touch flawlessly i prefer not having buttons on the face of the unit so the touch features are niceive currently got approximately 30 full length novels on it and there is still tons of space available for reading material there is no worry in my mind that ill ever fill the entire storage capacityi dont anticipate needing another kindle after buying this one it definitely exceeds my expectations,works and looks like new
3.0,its very nice and lightweight i would have given it more stars if you could read with it in the dark,its very nice and lightweight
5.0,love it lightweight and small enough to fit easily into my purse size and weight make it easy and comfortable to read in bed my original kindle didnt work with our home wifi but this one does and makes ordering new books so easy so glad i bought it,love it lightweight and small enough to fit easily 
2.0,it was hard to see there needs to be a backlight for older folks otherwise it was a good investment,it was a good investment
5.0,i like it so far and will probably like it more after i learn how to maneuver it there are many features that i might not use but at least they are there it i need them lightweight and touchscreenwhat a winner,i picked a winner this time
3.0,it is good to read but i realized i wanted a different one after i got it its too small for my taste,it is good to read but i realized i wanted a different 
4.0,not as intuitive as earlier models but once one becomes familiar with the interfaceand reads the guideits pretty simple also the features not on my older kindles like storing words one looks up and having the covers of books shown in the library make it even better,an overall improvment
4.0,great starter kindle wished i spent a little more for the backlit option or the fire still is great,works as expected
5.0,this is truly a great product the fact that my kindle can stores so many books and i can take them with me anywhere i go this can fit in the smallest of pocketbooks and also it can fit in my coat or the pocket of a light jacket its antiglare its great indoors and outdoors this product is what it says it is i dont understand why people complain about it not having a back light when it clearly doesnt states that it doesnt have one to begin with for the price of this product its well worth it now if you want a backlight which for me i dont find it necessary even though i wear glasses then yeah you can go ahead and spend the extra 30 or 40 i would totally recommend this product for the carefree and fussy free person i find this adorable affordable very well priced superlite to carry and an endless library of books to choose from which i might add that the books are very well priced no complaints here like many of the other reviews i would totally recommend this product over exceeded my expectations thank you amazon a million times,this is truly a great product the fact that my kindle can stores 
4.0,the kindle reads like a newspaper in other words there is no back light in this particular model and external light is necessary it is very easy read with such lighting it is a great product for the price i would prefer a back light if that were available i was disappointed that i was unable to download the free book program as advertized maybe because i had another kindle,the kindle reads like a newspaper
2.0,i liked the original better this iteration has a darker screen and it seems more cramped on the screen,older was better wish i had gone to the paperwhite
5.0,great size and can see it in places where i can not see my nonglare kindle wish i had gotten it sooner,great size and can see it in places where i

3.0,works best when the user has an amazon account so i would recommend for someone who uses amazon oftenly,three stars
5.0,i have a paperweight and this kindle the glare free kindle is just a nice to read on as my paperweight,paperweight vs glare free kindle

5.0,this kindle does not have a light and while i was disappointed at first its not really a big deal books dont have lights and i can see the screen as clearly as a book though the back is grayish and not white like paper i adjusted quickly its better on your eyes as a nighttime reader as well this ereader was cheap only 49 on black friday sale perfect for an introductory ereaderimportant detail about ereaders that i did not anticipate ebooks arent arent cheaper for new releases older books are for the most part and amazon limits your rights to your purchase you cant share libraries with friends well because your kindle is synced to a single amazon account this is annoying because i tend to share books with friends and the time limit to borrow a book is two weeksedit one year later my kindle is going strong and i have really come to love it ive upped my rating from 4 stars to 5 i love being able to download a bunch of books from the kindle store theres a very good selection of rotating free books im reading more than i have in years and i really like that reading has become part of my nightly routine again,a great introductory ereader
3.0,had i known it did not have a back light to read in the dark i would not have bought it but i like it,not bad for the price
5.0,i really am enjoying this product i had ordered the put to sleepwake up folder but could not get the kindle in iti returned and received a refund on the folder but not the light i purchased to go with it it would be most appreciated if you could refund the cost of the light as well,i really am enjoying this product i had ordered 
3.0,i am enjoying my new kindle however it is not the size that was described to me when ordering it on the phone i wanted one that fit my old kindle cover and it wasnt even close i had to purchase a new cover which i wasnt planning on doing the actual kindle itself seems to be fine,i am enjoying my new kindle however it 
5.0,i like the touch screen feature on this new generation kids are getting this as a gift so time will tell how they like them but i am impressed with the ease of use much improved over last years model,i like the touch screen feature on this new generation
4.0,overall it is a very comfortable reading experience it is small and lightweight comparable to a paperback book the screen is not reflective at all expect to be bombarded by ads for books while it is sleeping or while shopping it is likely that the ads learn what kind of books you like but mine hasnt yet and i am not looking for romance novels,comfortable reader
4.0,i love it now i can pick out favorite books at a much lower cost i like it because i no longer needto hold a book and flip pages or mark where i left off my daughter gave this to me as a gift otherwisei probably wouldnt have ever gotten one,i love it now i can pick out favorite books 
5.0,first time owning an ereader and it functions perfectly it has been a great investment in ordering one for two reasons one i am able to buy my school book on the kindle and cary them whereever i go leads me to my second reason i am reservist and i am able to take with me my books without adding extra weight to my backback or worrying about my books getting damage i do keep my kindle in a waterproof bag while training so far havent had any problems the kindle is simple to use and reliable,first kindle

5.0,bought this for my son age 9 who goes through kindles like a teen age girl goes through mood swings his aunt gave him her old nook but those cant hang with the ease of purchase and the online saveability that kindle offers hopefully this one doesnt get accidentally tossed into the washing machine like the last one,simply the best

3.0,too small no clear directions about how to maneuver through different appsstill considering returning it,three stars
4.0,its great but had i known that the with special offers meant it would display an ad all day i probably would have just upgraded to the other one love the functionality and everything having the ability to pay out of these ads would be awesome though maybe there is a way i dont know,its great but had i known that the with special offers 
5.0,our daughter is loving it the options available and the noglare screen are really nice first kindle,first kindle nice
5.0,i dont know why i didnt try using one of these ereaders sooner it is so much easier than books my fear was losing my place when i turned it off you turn it on and you are right where you left off great piece of technology,great piece of
5.0,i got this on the latest promotion and it was worth every penny the newest generation of the eink kindle is outstanding in its screens responsiveness i was so impressed with it when i was using it to navigate i cant wait to dive into some new books,latest generation biggest improvement
5.0,if youre looking for a basic ereader to hold your book without too many bells and whistles this is a good choice i previously owned an older kindle with a keyboard compared to that one the device is smaller but the screen is the same size the touchscreen is responsive and you can tap once to turn the page in lieu of a turn page button battery life is excellent can last several weeks because its so thin you may want a case if you plan on taking it out for storing it in a bag or purse i was pleased with an acdream case which provided 365 degree coverage an a sleepwake magnet that turns the device on or off when you open the cover,lightweight portable and effective
5.0,i have owned my kindle for about 1 year now and i have to honestly say that it is the closest thing to reading a real book just as a background i am an occasional reader who is starting to read more and more the price is perfect for an entry kindle for people who are like me who occasionally read however this is the closest thing to reading a physical book as we all know physical paper back or hardcover books have no backlighting just like this kindle for me not having the backlighting has its pros and cons i prefer the backlighting because i like to read before bed but not having a backlight really makes me feel like i am holding a real book it is mind blowing to me that amazon has created this eink design and really make it look and feel like a real book i am currently waiting for my oasis to arrive and i really cant wait to use itjust some quick pros and cons belowpros1 no backlight makes it feel like a paperback book2 battery life is pretty good3 i like that i can read on my iphone and kindle picks up the current pagecons1 i wish it was backlight i know that might sound contradicting but it would be nice2 turning pages is kind of slow,general review from a moderate reader
5.0,we love it so until i can afford a second one the twins take turns its so easy to switch the profile except i have to put in the password they are 14 and too distracted with the internet my daughter out reads her brother 101 i may get the upgraded version for her she loves books,love the kindle kids
4.0,all as i expected easy to use like that it came with howtouse instructions on the kindle i hope it lasts as long as my previous kindle i havent ordered the plugin accessory yet that is the only disappointment that the plugin has to be purchased separately and not included in the overall cost of the kindle however i knew this before i purchased the kindle,easy to use
5.0,just received a kindle w6 display love the device i can read all of my books late into the night with disturbing my wife like i used to wmy laptop great product sorry it took a while before i got oneno issues everyone should have one,great kindle
5.0,this is my first ereader and its awesome it came with my amazon account on it so set up was a breeze then all i had to do was plug it into my computer and simply upload my books onto it the books look great and it really does look like real paper overall this is a great ebook and is environmentally friendly after about 100 books if you love reading and want to carry your library everywhere do yourself a favor and buy a kindle you wont regret it this kindle is not back lit i do not understand why its such a big deal considering that normal books do not light upif you really want to read in the dark then buy a clipon reading light for 820 or buy a kindle paperwhite for 119210,great for book lovers who read with the light on
4.0,id rather have paid 40 bucks more for something lighter with buildin light to be able to read in the dark,id rather have paid 40 bucks more for something lighter

1.0,avid reader but its too small for me i would have been really happy with the dx if they still made them,shoulda bought a dx when they were still available
3.0,1 its bulky with the cover2 the cover is not user friendly3 didnt like the way the page turn you can only turn pages left by touching the right side of the screen and right by touching the left side of the screen i prefer to be able to turn one way by touching either side of the screen that way when i am holding either with left or right hand i can still turn the page4 because it is so sensitive sometimes the pages turned more than once,2 the cover is not user friendly 3 didnt like the way the page turn
2.0,it really is glare free i was sorry about that and it doesnt always go to the page i left when reopened,it really is glare free i was sorry about 
5.0,i do not know what it looks the kindle paperwhite or if there is much differences between the kp and the k6 however i do not have any regret on my k6 i must say that i bought it with an special offer 5000 for being an amazon member maybe you can wati for this kind of offers to buy one so i am happy,i am happy
5.0,i have been on the fence forever about purchasing a kindle im loving every minute of it so glad i did,loving every minute
5.0,have had a kindle for a long time wouldnt be without one easy to use and the price for kindle books fits my budget should make it easier to disconnect wifi do not understand why it was changed thought i might miss the keyboard that was on my older kindle not so the new one works fine,easy to use and the price for kindle books fits 
4.0,it needs a button so i can adjust the light on the words i think outside reading is good but inside to dark, light on the words i think outside reading is good but inside to
5.0,easy to use easy to hold easy to sync with the amazon account you can transfer files directly from your computer as well using a usb cable and it sports a few file types if i went back i would have gotten the higher dpi version but the lower end version works just fine,easy to use
3.0,two of the first three books i ordered were incompatible with this kindle pretty disappointing,incompatibility
5.0,i really like it but am not sure exactly what model it is i bought the waterproof case and a standard case neither of which fit i have to send both back they were listed as recommended accessories for this model the device itself is great feels good in my hands easy to read screen and fonts ive had it a week and havent had to charge it so the battery life appears good,great device
5.0,im not a person loves reading its the gift my hubby gave to me i use it to read bible its convenient,im not a person loves reading its the gift 
5.0,my favorite basic kindle so far the touchscreen is much better than the buttons my last device was a 5th gen basic kindle and this is better i prefer not having a backlight if i need to read in the dark i can use the kindle app on my ipad the bookerly font is great i only wish the device had at least the 212 ppi of the original paperwhite,almost perfect
1.0,this is a poor substitute for the kindle i traded in no it is much smaller which means it small print on the navigation screens no 2 it is hard to turn on i have to depress the on button before it with wake up no 3 the book titles are hard to read because the contrast is poor at least with my old kindle i was able to read the tittle no 4 changing fount size is impossible,not positive improvement from my previous kindle device
4.0,so far this device has met my expectations downloads are very quick and the battery life is great even though the menu is easily accessed onscreen it would be nice if it had a physical home button on the device,downloads are very quick and the battery life is great even though the menu is easily accessed onscreen
3.0,good functional well designedbad wow resolution of text was noticeable on my eyes i didnt feel it was healthy to continue reading on it it also had a weird habit of jumping pages really annoying im sure there was a fix for that but honestly for a device that is built to just read books from its own library there shouldnt be any issuesconclusion at least go with the kindle paperwhite the lightingnot backlighting and the higher ppi really make a difference if you can invest in the kindle voyage it is really nice albeit a bit overpriced the kobo hd glo is nearly as good as the voyage for a good amount less money i have a feeling this technology is going to simultaneously improve and get a lot cheaper in the near future,eh
5.0,i was not sure i would like it but i do it is very easy to read and i read more books sense i have it as i can buy 2 for the price of one and i love the sales you have on books i havent used your free library yet but i am looking forward to it took it on vacation for easy reading at the beachin the sun wonderful and i dont have to charge it up very often a great item and a great price thank you ac,i was not sure i would like it but i do
5.0,does everything i expected it to wanted a reader i could use while sitting outside in the sun does not have the same functionality as my kindle fire but that wasnt what i was looking for since i already have one instead this allows me plenty of pool days and sunshine without having to hide in the shade completely satisfied and still amazed at how well i can read my books glare free,friends with the sun and outdoors again
5.0,yes,five stars
5.0,yes,five stars

5.0,fun,five stars
5.0,ive mostly been a book reader with the occasional ebook when price was a major difference i read my books on an ipad but then i got an offer recently for a 29 kindle and decided to give it a try best decision ever its so much easier to read on vs the ipad its pretty much like having a real book minus the bulk much more comfortable to hold while reading compared to my ipad with a case its like im holding a real book my only regret is that i wish i wouldve gotten a kindle years ago i will mostly buy ebooks from now on,what took me so long to get one
5.0,bad,five stars
3.0,this is my second kindle i originally had the 2012 version but lost it they are light and thin and surprisingly easy to lose i use an ipad to do most of my reading but wanted an inexpensive barebones device just for the beach or for reading before bedwhat i was surprised to discover is i found this version annoying to use the pages flicker a bit when turning and its just hard to get used to a touch screen after a year of not using it much im selling mine and buying a used 2012 version so i can have the side page turn buttons backthree stars because kindles are just simply great devices youd never think you need but the long battery life ease of reading the eink so it doesnt interfere with your sleep like an ipad make these a worthwhile purchase this just isnt my favorite model,touchscreen is not for me
5.0,wow,five stars
4.0,got this as gift to replace my kindle i purchased when they were first put out it is easier to turn pages for sure however since i am really computer challenged it is harder for me to figure out what is what good thing my granddaughter and daughter are here to help me would sure be nice to get printed directions wthings rather than always depending on the computer i like to read directions much easier for me to comprehend i am over 70 years old so go figure,nice gift
5.0,love it the battery lasts a very long time and this kindle is a super gift to give or in my case receive,love it
5.0,this is a slick portable long last battery ereader it does it and it does it very well amazon makes solid easy to use inexpensive devices and the new kindle with touch screen is exactly that you arent getting a mistasking apple device with all the bright lights bells and whistles i have an ipad i wanted something that wasnt going to bug me with notifications every three minutes while im trying to read these kindles are quiet they last a long time between charges this one is about the size of a mass market paper back kindles app allows for sharing between devices something that ibooks doesnt allow for instance if my wife is reading a book on the kindle i can read the same book or another book on my ipad mini because of the kindle app i wish i would have gotten the kindle before the ipad because that way all my books would be on all my devices instead all my books i purchased in ibooks are stuck on my ipad anyway i have only had the kindle for a short time but i like it mainly because its easier on my eyes it was only 50 dollars on black friday its extremely light weight and im not interrupted by all the crap you are able to download with an ipad its simple convenient cool,dont expect a hammer to do a screwdrivers job
3.0,this kindle is too complex for my needs i preferred my first kindle which was simplejudith alexander,too complex
5.0,i received my kindle for my birthday it has brought me such joy i love the feature of being able to make the letters larger and easier to see i have loaded many books including children books i thought my grandchildren might enjoy reading when visiting the touch screen is so nicejust touch and the page turns i have read several of my books and have really enjoyed the story lines take my advice buy a kindle or one of the many readers that are offered to suit your needs you truly will love to read againpaula andrews,everyone should own a kindle 
2.0,when i turned on the device launched in demo mode how can i restart correctly and register my new kindle,help to get the demo mode

5.0,i love my paperwhite lighttweight easy to ready the ability to adjust the light level so easily is key,five stars
5.0,this is perfect for someone who wants no distractions the fancier versions of the kindle and tablets bring its so simple and easy to use portable and very light i love my kindle for the major price difference between this one and the one with the backlight built in its much cheaper to buy an led light that hooks inn and it works just as well,this is perfect for someone who wants no distractions the fancier versions 
3.0,i returned this i didnt like that it didnt have a brightness button u couldnt even see it at night ,i didnt like that it didnt have a brightness button
4.0,i chose this version of the kindle over the paperwhite because of a great price offer at the time at first the whole touchscreen thing was confusingannoying because it just seemed to constantly respond to any touch the usage instructions contained in the kindle were not too helpful i went online and downloaded them on my pc and then things got much betterit is now quite easy to use and i have loaded my cloud library on the device my only complaint is that the screen is rather gray not like the paper in any book i ever read i will definitely need a reading light for it,touchscreen kindle works fine
4.0,good product does exactly what i expected the refresh between each page can be disorienting and the screen glare touted as the differentiator from an ipad or other tablet is muted but direct light still makes it hard to read overall a pretty good product,meets expectations for hardware exceeds for quality and content management
2.0,black casing looks like 3 yrs old already gloss already wearing off looks scratched like the orginal better,two stars
3.0,i really did not notice any difference between this model and the previous generation overall it meets my needs,its ok
3.0,i had on original kindle from several years ago it had buttons to advance and go back pages i liked this better than the touch screen i use it mainly to read while im driving hit a red light and read a couple of pages i find it too easy for the pages to change when i put it down or pick it up ive also noticed that certain places have special commands so you have to be careful what you touch we purchased one for my mother in law at the same time she called last night because it jumped to the end of the book she could figure out how to get back,i liked this better than the touch screen
2.0,very disappointed at the quality of the product its sooooo buggy when i started up the screen was nonresponsive on the select language page i tapped many many times until it finally responded and randomly selected french when i start reading i find that at certain font size certain words are chopped off another problem i encountered is sometimes i cannot go back to a previous page i can only go forward and i bought two of them both are like that im very shocked at the quality of the product,very disappointed at the quality of the product
1.0,loved my old kindle hate the touchscreen now unit will not find and hook up with my wifi big lose of money,miss the old kindle
5.0,this is the best way for me to read a book i have arthritis in my hands and i am able to read a long time due to the no glare on my bifocal glasses and holding the kindle is so light weight i would recommend this product to young and older people who like to read and also with so many special features on this kindle you can learn so very much so fast,perfect size
5.0,i really havent had the time id like to play with it but it works great and stays charged forever,nice
3.0,screen is dim and there isnt instruction about how to brighten also the 6 dimensions are just enough bigger to make the holder for 20122013 kindle that i bought too small downloads are easy enough i think it should come with a power cord and not have to spend another 20 dollars for a power adapter,downloads are easy enough i think it should come with a

5.0,i am currently looking to replace my kindle according to amazon it would be a 6th generation kindle so that is what brought me to this page as i read the reviews i knew i needed to speak up in defense of this modela short history to understand where i come from i bought my first kindle in 2009 and gave it to my daughter when she married later that year it was a 2nd or 3rd generation model i then bought the next generation model and used it for about 225 years until i had to replace it because the battery wouldnt hold a charge any more at that time i used my kindle about 6 hours a day sometimes up to 12 hours i then bought the current one in the summer of 2013 this one saw less use because less than a month later my husband got me a kindle fire but still i would have to admit i have given it a work out and now it too no longer will hold a chargefor those who ask why i would use both kindles the answer is simple as you can see from the above information i read a lot i read on the way to work on my break at work at home sitting in my living room or den and in my bed at night after my spouse is asleep i initially took my kindle fire everywhere with me until i found that in bright light it was harder to read that my other kindle while in dim light i like the display light of the fire so when i travel to the beach i pack my kindle touch and drag it everywhere and believe me when i say everywhere and it has performed without a problemso end of the story is that now i need to replace that kindle and i believe ill get another touchadd ive been able to get a hold of a relatives kindle voyage and i really liked it why you ask because the contrast in sunlight was just as good as my kindle touch but unlike the touch i can read it in the dark without waking up my husband the other plus is that unlike my fire the voyage didnt give me eye fatigue meaning i read it one night without a problem for close to 8 hours where at 4 hours in the dark with the fire i begin to feel the strain so what am i to do now well right now ill keep my touch and use the fire in the dark but when the touch goes get a voyageoh and by the way i get about 2436 hours of reading time with the wireless off with one charge this equals a charge about every 3rd day or on long weekend a partial charge every night this is the same with my fire my 2nd gen kindle really did go for weeks 2 or 3 between charges my 3rd gen kindle made it about a week but my touch seems to lose more charge and i think its because i sleep it and dont turn it off maybe it would last a whole week if i turned it off every night but who knows,long time kindle user loves the kindle without a light

2.0,the touch screen is a nice feature but it is also the problem sometimes its not always easy to only touch the edges of a device your fingers cramp up and you ajust your hand and then you have just made changes i will have to buy a case or put some kind of protector on the screen to make it easy to read while holding it but have access to the screen to turn pages this is a good device if you only read at a table and dont have to hold it,touch too much

4.0,i had to replace my dead kindle 2 which i loved the new one is ok the touchscreen is fast and responsive a little too responsive somehow my fonts increase with the slightest touch and i dont even realize im doing it brushing dust off the screen can result in spending several minutes finding your place if you accidentally page forward paging backward to find your place can be an adventurethat said the kindle is easy to navigate the ads are not intrusive online browsing is good shopping is good but i would trade for my kindle 2 or even my original kindle if i could it was hard to accidentally flip pages or access the systemoptions,kindle touch is good

4.0,i really like the touch screen and the ease with which i can look up definitions and type as well as get on the internet sometimes its almost too easy to turn too many pages at once but id rather that be the case from time to time than use the side buttons i used to have thank you for the 7th generation kindle its well worth updating as far as im concerned,7th generation kindle a good buy

3.0,my bad i bought the bundle for kids which comes with this type of kindle we have 3 kindles in our family now this is for our youngest but i failed to notice the most obvious limitation it doesnt come with an internal lightthe kids best reading time is at night before bed same with their dad and i the light is essentialas i said i failed to notice but i am sure others have as well so what you need is the paperwhite edition if you want a light,my bad doesnt have an embedded light need paperwhite for that

3.0,this is a fine kindle nothing fancy but meets all the basic needs i gave it a three because it is a little dim since it has no light which is like a regular book i would have liked it to be a bit brighter however the letters are very clear and of course the font and size is adjustable i probably would have been happier with the the next one up that has a light but this was a gift and a very nice one as with any hard copy book just be near a good light source you can do searches and make notes and it has a dictionary so im not really sure what the next one up gives you except for light and a little better resolution id go to a store and see if that makes a difference to you,this is a fine kindle nothing fancy but meets all the basic

3.0,i bought this kindle during the prime sale so it cost 50 or about 30 cheaper i was impressed with the eink technology and was wanting a readertablet as a musician i also wanted a device that i could easily display custom documents like lyrics and lead sheets while performing so far its been difficult to get your documents displayed exactly as you intend the interface is much clunkier than android or ios what i would like to see is a spruced up os maybe with better organization folder options syncable to google drive or dropbox variable text scaling as opposed to stepped options it works ok but i feel like maybe i should have bought a tablet for what im looking to do with the device,i also wanted a device that i could easily display custom documents like lyrics and lead sheets while 
3.0,tends to turn off go to the wrong place in the book when turned on or change font size if touched on the wrong spot i would prefer a backlit screen i wish kindle had page nos displayed rather than percentages going to amazon finding books works very well kindle unlimited is a really great deal for me since i read about 20 books per monthi would also like preorders to be displayed or to know how to get a list of what i have preordered without doing an author search so i can make sure the funds are available,going to amazon finding books works very well kindle unlimited is a really great deal for me since i read about 20 books 
3.0,received this for fathers day which of course means i was thankful to receive a present from my kids i am for better or worse one of those people who adore reading traditional papermade books the tactile experience and joy ive received from reading paper books throughout my life has made me averse to change into digital reading i feel this kindle is merely ok the ability to carry a lot of books in a pocket device is nice but i would prefer to have a device that had a backlight for my aging eyes and reading on this kindle doesnt provide the same joyful experience yet as i get from reading a paper book,fathers day present
4.0,very good though screen responses to touches are too slow compared to standard tablets however battery life is excellent,overall an ok product
5.0,i ordered the kids bundle for myself and am loving it i am currently sharing it with the 10 year old but with her reading more with the availability of the kindle and kindle unlimited i may have to buy her one of her own,really cant recommend this enough

2.0,after using the kindle keyboard for years i was very disappointed in the touchscreen one of the main problems was the inability to use a good reading light  the only ones that will work with it are the clipon lights that need batteries i do not want to be constantly carrying batteries around with me i checked into all of the available cases and there are several that say they will work but this kindle has no way to power them no connectors i also wanted to be able to use headphonesas a simple reader in daylight or using room light it would be just fine and the price is very good l you get what you pay for i have returned it for a fire 6 and am very happy, using the kindle keyboard for years i was very disappointed in the touchscreen

2.0,i ordered this by mistake and wife was use to back lighted kindle which was lost i wrote amazon to say i was sending it back but my wife had tried it out and is concerned about her credit card info that she put on this kindle so i guess we will just keep it and then order what she wants,wanted a back lit kindleand ordered wrong

2.0,kindle is a great way of reading books etc however kindle 6 is too small has no integrated light for reading in comfort,kindle is a great way of reading books
3.0,i do like this kindle its easy to use but i wish they would have made it clear that i can charge it from a computer with a usb port and that the battery lasts for several week otherwise i would not have bought the 15 dollar power adapter,kindle is good i wouldnt buy the power adapter though

3.0,i knew this was a simple version of a kindle but was disappointed there is no light for reading in bed otherwise its okay,for daylight reading only
5.0,i never would have thought it but i like it even better than paper its also light weight which puts less weight on my arm so my arm doesnt get as sore from long reading i think i read more with it too its just great,wonderful experience like it better than paper
3.0,didnt realize how small the screen would actually be which is my fault but not the most user friendly kindle i have owned,just ok
4.0,my wife has the original 3g kindle and a friend of mine has the current generation kindle paper white this kindle has a darker screen than both of the kindles mentioned above i opted not to buy the paper white as i figured that ive gone my entire life reading paper books without a built in back light however if you open up a paper book next to this kindle in a lower light situation dimly lit living room at night the paper book is easily readable while the kindle is very difficult to see without significant eye strain with that said as long as you have sufficient light its easily readable with no eye strain i love the size and form factor weight and that i can easily switch between books on a whim would give five stars if it wasnt for the dark screen,love it but has a dark screen
2.0,thought it had a nightlight along with anti glare so was a little disappointed this is my 3rd kindle so i do like them,kindle

5.0,i got the kindle for 50 on cyber monday and figured if i didnt like it then i only wasted 50 thankfully i am really enjoying it the thing i find most appealing about thisbebook is the convince i can purchase a book online and it is immediately on my kindle i also find the recommendations in the kindle store very helpful on choosing my next book the kindle is lightweight and very portable the glarefree works like a charm ive read on the beach in the glaring sun and it worked great i also like the cool features the kindle has like the character list i also like how you can click on any word and it will tell you the definition and store that word in your vocab builder the battery lasts forever days even a couple weeks the only negative thing about this kindle is there is no built in light so its hard to read in the dark like any book however i bought this kindle knowing that so i will not fault it for that overall i love it because it has really made me more passionate about reading,convenience is key
4.0,the 59 kindle is a bargainthis is my first ereader and i was undecided on which model to get so wound up choosing the cheapest one i have to say i really enjoy reading on it and find it easy to use the whole process is really easy from setting it up to buying your first book and reading it the functions are very intuitive and i find myself leaving lots of highlights notes and book marks to make referencing at a later date painlessthe only down side of this product is that it is very basic so if you are a gadget person just antiup and get the kindle fire which is probably what i will do after i put some miles on the one i haveone really nice feature of the 6 kindle is that it will fit in the inside breast pocket of a mens suit jacket or pretty much any winter coat inner pocket which makes it easy to carry on the train for those of us that dont carry a manbag around,great value fun to read
3.0,i really like the kindle i just did not like that there is no lighting options i wanted to be able to read it in all settings,ok
5.0,love it need to come up with a ruggedized version since ive broken so many of these due to my own negligence over the years,love it need to come up with a ruggedized

2.0,i cant get my new kindle to connect to my wifi it worked for an hour one night but sporadically since that time not at all,wifi connection a problem
2.0,i like this kindle but am disappointed when looking for a case i cant figure out what generation it is kindles are the only product sold at amazon that dont allow questions according to amazons own systemshow results forany categorykindle storeamazon device accessorieskindle paperwhite covers 93kindle ereader accessories 5379kindle keyboard 3rd generation covers 2kindle 7th generation accessories 46kindle 5th generation covers 38kindle touch 4th generation covers 41kindle 7th generation covers 35kindle fire hd 3rd generation covers 38kindle fire hdx 3rd generation covers 28kindle fire 2nd generation covers 25fire tablet accessories 3591stands 1styluses 4 see lessso what generation is it looking up the word generation on this page has no useful resultsi click on 7th generation and i click on one of those they have this review httpsmileamazoncomkindlecoverturquoisenupropaperwhitedpb00lti5gnsrefsr12sfionahardwareieutf8qid1444531048sr12keywordscoverit appears this item has been renamed by amazon since i first received it from vine and posted my review at that time it was called kindle case kindle paperwhite case kindle touch case   this understandably led me to assume that it would be equally appropriate for any of those three devices but assuming that the unqualified kindle meant the basic 89 model this was not the case it did not fit my kindle it almost fit but it was too tall and tapping the power button inevitably pushed the device up against the top straps with quite a bit of overhang on the bottomin a nut shell as long as the product isnt made by amazon its good to buy on amazonstill frustrated wanting a case so since there are no questions available on amazon products can someone post what model this is,amazon disables its best features for amazon products making me never want to buy amazon products again
2.0,this was not what i thought i was getting its hard to see really not worth what i paid for it even though it was on sale,disappointed
5.0,i have always been a fan of reading real books hardbackpaperback until i realized i wasnt reading as much as i would like too bought the paperwhite and ive been reading on the train waiting in line walking to a meeting its amazing highly reccomend avid real book readers to give it a try,until i realized i wasnt reading as much as i would like too bought the paperwhite and ive been reading 
3.0,had amazon have stood by their product i would have given this 5 stars 13 months after i purchased it one month past warranty the kindle screen froze and would not reset because i was no longer under warranty i was given the opportunity to buy a replacement for 17900 3g model i understand it was out of warranty and would not expect a free one but if the product broke just outside of warranty the manufacturer should stand by their product and at least offer a replacement at a discounted rate not full retail,had amazon have stood by their product i would have 
5.0,i ought this as a gift for my dad who does not even know how to turn on a computer really i made him an email account to get started and attached his credit card to his account i showed him how to get books but paid and the many free novels available and he was off like a shot i think ill have to update his credit card when he gets a new one in a few years but other than that he took to this like a duck to water he loves it,perfect for my technophobe dad
4.0,nice device to own little sad about price decrease of another 10 for thanksgiving while i happened to buy just 10 days ago,good one but sad one
5.0,1 the screen is excellent because it doesnt have a backlight its like reading a paperback ive read for hours at a time without strain2 the battery lasts forever3 4gb of storage i downloaded my entire book collection and i still have enough space left to do it 3 more times4 light it doesnt weigh a ton so its easy to hold for long periods5 faster it might just be me but page turns and the like seem snappier on this kindle than older ones ive owned6 price i got my on the five month payment plan 15 bucks a month is nothing well worth it,the new kindle excellent

4.0,i like it very much it serves the purpose as an ereader and noting else honestly this is only for reading and that is why i bought it to read kindle books it is clear the text is sharp and the size is perfect for putting in your purse of backpack i suggest getting a case with it though it is pretty light and slips out of the hand a little too easily for my taste,good for reading bad for games and web browsing
5.0,excellent product athough i wish the touch had an option of locking all features but the page turing option because the slightest touch changes the features even when you dont want it shipping packaging and set up are so well thought out and user friendly,excellent product athough i wish the touch had an 
1.0,i was disappointed when i got this product it was much smaller than i had anticipated i havent read a single book with it its too small i use to own an original kindle i can care less that its a touch screen because its uncomfortable in my hands,not that great
5.0,as my first venture into ebooks this kindle was great i usually buy a select number of offers but with the free books i received with the trial of prime i was able to download some authors i had never heard of before this the kindle instructions are a little confusing at first but still after some experimentation easy to master so far i generally know when the books i want come out so that i can preorder with little trouble and know exactly when i will receive them i no longer have to put a note on my calendar to go out and buy them or wait for the mail,as my first venture into ebooks this kindle was great i usually buy a select number of offers 
5.0,this is my first ereader ever so i dont have any other experiences to compare with this product but so far i am thoroughly enjoying using my kindle even though i am still in learning mode with some of the ereading functions i love the nonglare scree and the print is very clear and easy to read at times i think it would be nice to have a backlit screen but i rarely have a need for one i love the size of this kindle its lightweight and easy to hold in one hand this one includes special offers but they are not distracting because they only show up when i first open my kindle the low price of 79 with special offers is one reason i decided to try this product because i was not sure whether i would like using an ereader i would highly recommend this kindle to anyone especially to anyone who has never used an ereader before,a great first ereader
4.0,i like this product a lot but i was so use to my other kindle that it takes getting use to the other one would not take a charge,kindle 6 inch glarefree touch screen

5.0,this was supposed to be a kindle paperwhite must not be as the paperwhite cover i purchased from amazon does not fit i will do some research to see how many models there areotherwise i love the device it is fast clear and works well,maybe its not what i ordered but love it anyway
3.0,i made a mistake to getting this for not paying attention that has no light should have paid attention when buying this product,i made a mistake to getting this for not paying 
1.0,when i bought this it never said you wouldnt be able to adjust the screen brightness for almost a hundred bucks it should have that feature i never would have purchased anything that you cant adjust the shade of the pages if it were the same color pages as a real book that would be one thing but this is dull grey and i have to squint to read it which is not good if you have glaucoma because squinting raises eye pressure i spent a few wasted hours trying to figure out how to make the screen brighter only to figure out it isnt possible i am mad that i wasted alot to buy this only to not be able to use it i have tried to give it away and as soon as anyone sees the screen they dont want it not even for free,dull grey pages
4.0,my old one broke after 2 years i went into catatonia now i have a replacement and can retreat into my classics and history again,thank god my fix came in time

3.0,this is my third kindle and i have to say that i am disappointed compared to my earlier kindles this one doesnt hold a charge at all in a week and a half to two weeks it needs to be charged while my other kindles lasted 3 or even 4 weeks before needing to be charged another problem is that is is super slippery i have a case for it but i like to take it out of the case to read and the darn thing slips off of everything i will obviously keep using it buti hope it doesnt break on one of its falls to the ground,and i have to say that i am disappointed compared to my earlier kindles
5.0,best choice i could have made it reads just like a book is very portable and user friendly my kindle goes everywhere with me,best choice i could have made
4.0,i love my new kindle touch but i sure do miss the page turning button on the sides instead of having to touch the screen to turn the page and i wasnt pleased that it was a tiny bit thicker and heavier than my original kindle but the touch feature is very convenient for looking up words and to maneuver between books and menus amazon please continue to offer the nonbacklit screen it is so much easier on my eyes than the backlit screen on the paperwhitedespite your claims to the opposite i love reading on my kindle and carry it with me everywhere in case i have a few minutes to read i never thought i would like it better than a physical book but now i couldnt live without it in fact when my original kindles screen burned out i ordered this the very same day,cant live without my kindle
4.0,great for being the entry level love the package for the kids especially removing the ads defn a viewable step down from the paperwhite or having lights for reading but for trying to see if the kids would even like it being on a budget it is excellent local library system doesnt have the simplest way of doing things but at least the kindle is up to date that it autoloads it and no hooking up usb cables to download like before never having them i still already miss some of the features of the upgrades understanding why but the kids are ecstatic and cant put it down id buy it again,kids package id do it again

5.0,effective basic reader common usb for charging i wanted the nonbacklight feature for minimal eye strain and it is perfect for that i own ipads but didnt want the light in my face for hours with longer reading materials the contrast is excellent the resolution is totally fine even though it is the lowest of the kindle line up its already twice common screen resolution basically and i read that all day without complaints its less responsive than an ipad lesser hardware for sure but does its simple job very well and distractionfree,i wanted the nonbacklight feature for minimal eye strain and it is perfect for that

4.0,this is my first kindle what a cute little thing it looks even better with my red case i bought to go with it i work in front of a computer screen most of the day so this is great because it doesnt feel like additional screen time someone described the graphics to me kinda like those mr doddle graphic magnet toys who write withwell thats what the print looks like i downloaded a trilogy and it took less than a minute i believe with wifi im still getting used to navigating around the thing i was having trouble scrolling around closing out certain windows etc but with time im sure that will be fine the only thing i dont like so much is that when i want to choose what books to purchase from the kindle store its in black in white and there isnt a description of the book but what i do is just go online on my personal computer and figure out which books i want to download first not a big deal oh another thing is that i didnt have to buy the adapter it says not included so i bought one it turns out that it comes with a usb cord if you have a power cord that has a usb port option then that would work such as your iphone charger,it looks even better with my red case i bought to go with

4.0,after my first generation kindle died i had to replace it while the touchscreen is great in theory in practice it can be a bit annoying as the slightest touch can flip a page i also find that if i press too hard while turning a page the kindle will jump forward 2 5 sometimes 15 pages it gets annoying i do like how quickly this kindle charges and how long it holds a charge,while the touchscreen is great in theory

3.0,perfectly good product for reading books screen is good touch is good an improvement over the key board controls and easier to hold without a case than my old onei just should have paid more attention when ordering to what was included i thought it would be the equivalent of my old kindle on which the screen had gone all wonkygarbled it does not have a headphone jack i used my previous kindle for listenting to audio books as well as reading and there dont seem to be any game options available for it the old version i had a good verison of scrabble and i had the nyt crossword puzzles that you could do right on the kindle,good kindle but pay attention to feature details if replacing an old one
5.0,i havent had my kindle for long but i really enjoy it its super light easy to read and the touchscreen works much better than i expected the page turns are fast at least compared to my old kindle keyboard my only complaints are minor for example landscape mode only goes one way the bottom of the device is on the left side but like i said very minor issue so far i think the biggest issue i have with it is that the back is harder and has less grip than my kindle keyboard it makes it a little harder to hold but im sure if it causes a big problem you could get a case for it all that considered i think that the price is really what kicked it up to 5 stars for me this is a really good deal and im super happy with my new kindle,but i really enjoy it its super light
3.0,it was a gift and she has been unable to sign on or read anything from the free material or the books i ordered i would not buy this again,its just okay i am not incredibly pleased
4.0,i love my kindle i was reading books on my ipad but did not like the glare i would give this 5 stars because its perfect for reading books but i am disappointed theres no integration for the audio books like on the app,perfect except the lack of audibles integration
3.0,im learning to like it but i feel i didnt do enough product investigation the size it really a handy feature but no backlight is a pain,im learning to like it but i feel i didnt do enough 
5.0,i had a kindle fire and really liked it but was in the market for a new kindle i went with this one because i love the touchscreen feature and that its glarefree i like not having the glowing screen since i use this primarily for reading,great for reading as primary purpose
2.0,very hard to work to go back to the book you were reading,two stars
1.0,i may have received a refurbished unit the name says andys 2nd kindle what the heck edit it is confirmed that i was sent a refurbished unit i have full access to the users cloud and ability to purchase books i cant believe first that i was sent a refurbished unit and second that it still had the users information on it,they sent me a refurbished unit with prior owners account still logged in are you kidding me
5.0,it does what it is supposed to do i am not sure what the missing swipe everyone is talking about i am able to swipe pages without issue,it does what it is supposed to do i 
3.0,since i am not technologically astute i really dont know how to use my kindle effectively i wish that it had come with directions on paper once i get used to this and my daughter walks me through the features i will probably be more comfortable with it but right now i am afraid to lose what i am currently reading to find something else or to explore its features,i will probably be more comfortable with it
2.0,the screen is too dark to read anything in the low light area it would be nice if there is a button to adjust the brightness of the screen,screen too dark in low light area
4.0,i wish there were some ways to adjust the lighting because sometimes it gets really difficult to read at night i never had a kindle before so at first it seemed kind of glitchy going from one screen to the next but now after getting used to it i really like itfor those who dont know this you can borrow ebooks from your local library so you can read them on your kindle just remember to return them via the link within your amazon account,i never had a kindle before so at first it seemed kind of glitchy going from one screen to the next but now after getting used
3.0,im still trying to get used to it i switched over my archived items from my old kindle but i cant find any of the games especially every word can you suggest a similar game even mahjong is not compatible with my new kindle,im still trying to get used to it i 
5.0,if you are looking for a simple and well price kindle then this is the one for you it is just the basic and does not have a built in light or web access but it is perfect for anyone just looking to read books on it,perfect if you are looking for something just for reading
3.0,hard to understand how to load books that i already have on it and how to adjust the size print hopefully one day ill be able to use it,hard to understand how to load books that i already 
2.0,disappointed that amazon makes a new version of the kindle that does not have an internal light feature but doesnt have a cover with a built in light available for purchase customer service was also incredibly lacking in knowledge of this fact and it took me 10 minutes of restating my question about this before they could confirm that there is not currently a cover with a built in light feature to accompany this kindle i have not complaints about the kindle itself but expected that they would have accessories available to go along with it,no cover with built in light available
3.0,they were wonderful as long as you had another source of light could not get a jacket with light for it so we upgraded to the paperwhite,they were wonderful as long as you had another source of light
5.0,i have always wanted to have a kindle i think this one is better than the one with light cause my friend bought one and we both love this one other than paperwhite but when changing pages still annoying,i think this one is better than the one with light cause my friend bought 
4.0,work great with glare resistance screen however i cant read at night without a light if amazon added a light would be better 5 stars,work great with glare resistance screen however i cant read at 
4.0,i am still learning how to use the various features i do not know if there is a way to find which page from the original book i am on this would be helpful if i am reading along in a class also at this point i wish i had bought a model with a larger screen,enjoying the kindle experience but still learning
5.0,its fantastic the touch screen is awesome for the lower grade kindle its very light and i like the thickness it makes the device much more comfortable to hold while reading a book the new layout of the home screen is nice and so are the tool bars the only down side is that you cant use apps like you could on the previous generation kindle buy now,impressive
5.0,i love my kindle its small compact and has great battery life with the prime lending library ive found myself reading more easy to read while sitting outside at the beach and easy to use perfect,love my kindle
4.0,i have just had the kindle for a week and am still trying to get use to it and all the information required to learn about it so far so good,so far so good
4.0,while its nice and does a great job as an e reader i liked my old kindle keyboard much better if you have a lot of books it is more difficult to see which ones you have read if you dont delete the ones you have read,kindle 6 inch e reader
2.0,nothing like i expected very small and kind of hard to read also bought a case for it and the case does not even close not satisfied at all,nothing like i expected
2.0,the only thing good about this kindle is that it is lightweight its much smaller than i expected for a reader and the management of the content is not intuitive at all i would not buy a kindle again,lightweight but too small content management is not intuitive
5.0,i like it a lot,five stars
5.0,i bought it for my niece for her 10th birthday party she is in love with it its easy to use and seemingly kid friendly this kindle has the ability to turn on parental controls so we turned off the ability to download books from the kindle and access the internet shes an absolute book worm so this was perfect it wasnt fancy and she still is able to read as she wants to,preteen friendly
2.0,it is really glarefree but makes it difficult to read in poor lighting conditions it also seems boring for kids as it is in black and white, really glarefree but makes it difficult to read in poor lighting conditions
4.0,being new to paperless book idea i found the kindle easy to set up and use i enjoy reading a light weight device that i can use to carry a ton of books to my favorite reading spots i like the adjustable text size paperlike appearance and fast download speed as well,great entry level device
2.0,i regret iti didnt realize i hadnt bought one that would light up its a disappointment its my own fault for placing the wrong order,its a disappointment its my own fault for placing the wrong 
5.0,i have been debating purchasing a kindle for awhile now and im so happy that i decided to easy set up great battery life and a huge selection of books ive always wanted to read more but cant seem to find the time to make it to a book store this makes finding new books easy and convenient all in all a great product,and im so happy that i decided to
3.0,love the kindle size is great but i hate the advertisements can this be turned off you even have ads that are offensive to me please help,mixed
5.0,great product light narrow easy to hold for people that have problems holding things especially for long time like i do easy on eyes for reading pleasure easy not complicated at all to work does everything my original first kindle fire did,great for readers and children that need encouragement to read more or ones already love to read

2.0,the screen is so grey and there is no way to brighten it up plus it is not keeping in sync with the kindle ap i read books on on my ipad,kinda disappointing
3.0,it was ok but i did miss a lighted screen so have returned it and have ordered the paperwhite offered for109 and eagerly await its delivery,glare free kindle vs paperwhite tablet
2.0,nothing said that there was no light in this kindle you cannot use it in the dark or low light without auxiliary light such as a flashlight,no backlight
5.0,this is my first ereader and its amazing light comfortable and easy to use people are giving this device a bad rating because you have to touch to turn the page i personally dont see the big deal and believe it works great if youre thinking of getting it you should well worth it,an amazing ereader 
2.0,this kindle has a couple of quirky features that drive me crazy ie you cant turn it off and it displays an image when you need to charge your battery but does not tell you what percentage your battery is on so that you know when to stop charging i think the engineers need to slow down and pay attention to detail,yesno
1.0,got this kindle fir christmasi was so excited to open package i charged kindle set up according to instructions and was so disappointed to find the screen wouldnt work print material shows up but screen is too dark to read co tent,kindle arrived nonfunctioning
2.0,ive been a kindle user for several years this was my 4th kindle and by far the worst reader us very cheaply made movement from one page to the next is not a smooth transition as ive seen on previous kindles and other ereaders additionally this particular kindles back is slick plastic and not steady in the hand previous versions had a rubber backing and seemed overall much better quality all in all this kindle is a definite step backward i would expect more from amazon on this one,step backward
3.0,bought the kindle then realized i already had the product it is easy to use and download from your computer wish i had bought the paperwhite,it is easy to use
4.0,i bought a kindle fire when it was launched and it works ok but i have seen the white paper before then i bought one and it works nice because you can ready it with sun light without problems with the books with kindle formatit can also open the pdf books without problems but the font size is small for me even using the display as land scape i saw it is possible to increase the font size but in that case it is necessary to scroll the page to be able to read it although it is not really practicalanyway i am happy with it although i will not be able to manage my technical stuff on it, paper before then i bought one and it works nice because you can ready it with sun light without 
5.0,wish this had a brightness control very dull light when trying to read in a lighted room there is no way to adjust the brightness on this model,very dull light when trying to read in a lighted room
5.0,it met all my expectations it is easy to read down loads enough of library to have variety the price was more than acceptable i have been resisting buying a kindle as i prefer printed material a real book versus a screen,worth the money
3.0,apparenty my fingers dont work properly because i have all kinds of dictionaries and things popping up im still trying to earn how to use it,apparenty my fingers dont work properly because i have all 
3.0,the 6 model is pretty small if you have good lighting and good eyes or glasses you can make the text pretty small but when i read in bed the lighting forces me to use larger type so i only get about 1 paragraph per page it is slower turning on and updating than i expected but it is acceptable,the 6 model is pretty small if you have good lighting and good 
2.0,absolutely nothing that is fabulous about this kindle if you are spending the money i would go with a nicer model as it does not offer extras,not ideal
5.0,it looks and feels fake like those fake phones on display at storesvery light no back light needs more fontgraphics is like an old gameboy or a ti83 calculator gamelooking up words helps out a bunchso simplebattery use is very efficienti love it but i returned it to get a firehd6 because i wanted to read at night pbought bestbuy,if you love reading and only reading this is awesome
4.0,i havent had it long enough to explore its features but it is light in the pocket and very portable unobtrusive ask again in a few months,good and clear resolution for my amd eyes
4.0,i am very satisfied with my new kindle eink i almost bought the paperwhite but decided against it because of the reviews known backlight issue i know technology constantly changes but i am with some of the other reviewers the touchscreen is too sensitive i want the page turn buttons back other than that i love my kindle,i love my kindle
2.0,i liked my kindle with button keyboard better also this new one has pics of books instead of listing them and i cant tell what they are ,sometimes newer isnt better
3.0,having the kindle with touch is so much better than the original version with the button controls on the sides the functionality and usibility is improved but my one complaint and why i downgraded my rating is that the casing feels cheap it is thicker than the previous version with some sharper lines and the case is unmistakably plasticwith my original kindle reader my only worry when dropping it was potentially cracking shattering the screen this one feels cheap enough that i worry the case would break or split,great features and functionality but feels cheap
3.0,theirs no light which is a big problem i would rate with five stars if you put like an update or something but other than that its pretty cool, i would rate with five stars if you put like an update or something but other than that its 
4.0,i like it but when i download library books the process seems more convoluted than i think it should be i have to go through my laptop or ipad through overdrive to get to the kindle i think you should figure out how to make it easier also when i hold the reader in the horizontal position with my right hand i would prefer to hold it by the fat end rather than the skinny end to me it just makes sense being right handed like most people maybe you could work on that,i like it but when i download library books the process 
5.0,this really is the best ereader out there perfect for those who work with lcd screens all day and want to give their eyes a break before bed,this really is the best ereader out there
4.0,i guess ill learn how to use it eventually this is very different from holding a book though maybe im just oldfashioned because im old,i guess ill learn how to use it eventually 
4.0,smaller than i thought but very portable and lightweight i am just upset that i need to spend additional money on a light so i can read at night having owned two previous kindles as well as the first generation of the kindle fire i bought this beause of its increased battery life and storage space its still brand new so i havent come across any issues yet,words from a lover of all things kindle
3.0,ive changed my review slightly i cant change the star rating much because my original complaint still holds true there is not a case with integral light available for this kindle because of its design and that is disappointing still however erin at amazon read my review and emailed me she suggested this light httpwwwamazoncombelkinclipreadingkindlegraphitedpb004zn5q5wrefsr18sdigitaltextieutf8qid1433020341sr18keywordscasewithlight and issued me a credit to try it out all without asking for anything as usual amazon does not disappoint ill let you all know how this light works id seen it previously but frankly it looked too bulky well seei was really excited for this purchase ive had the original kindle forever and love it but was always so frustrated by the constant accidental turning of pages i love the size of this one too overall the kindle itself i really like but unlike the original there is absolutely no lit case available that doesnt counter the small portability of the device remember the old kindle with builtin book light why oh why did you get rid of that option i am hesitant to purchase the newer backlit ones because that is the feature i like most about my kindle it really does still feel like reading a book and by using regular lamp light i dont feel like it keeps me up to read it im a read in bed every night person there are tons of studies that show looking at your cell phone or tablet messes with your bodys melatonin production and keeps you awake i know i can sit there and surf the internet in one capacity or another for ever on my phone thats not what i was looking for,amendment 53115 amazon customer service comes through again old review i think they made this one inferior to old orig
5.0,good,five stars
5.0,absolutely love it great product great price i take it with me everywhere i had a lot of the free classics like zane grey westerns and sherlock holmes from amazon which i set up from my laptop several years ago now i can read them on the kindle to add them to this kindle only costs 99 cents,great portable library
4.0,good,four stars
2.0,i bought this on cyber monday for a gift for my mom for mothers day upon turning it on for the first time it was in chinese we had to call customer service and talk to them for about 20 minutes and we were able to figure out how to put i in english now it wont charge im so frustrated that a brand new device is having so much trouble,brand new with lots of problems
5.0,nice,five stars
5.0,this kindle is superior to the first one i purchased which i have had problems with and can no longer use because the print size will no longer workbeing elderly i had initial problems but now that i have mastered its use i find it brilliant i love it everything on it is just a touch away i would heartily recommend this to any one whether its a first or replacement like mine,a new kindle
5.0,good,five stars
5.0,having only used sony ereaders and ipad2 i would say this has been money well spenti read a lot and some times thick paperbacks are hard to hold this light hand held device is just the ticket much easier to download purchases than the sony ereader ever was and much better than the kobos product that sony partnered with when they decided to go out of the e reader businessmy only regret isi wish i could read my old books that were purchased through sony ereader store and kobos on my new device,money well spent
5.0,good,five stars
4.0,this was a nice replacement of my older kindle which i dropped recently it is a little smaller than my old one but still easy to read and actually lighter i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 as i found getting back to the menu difficult but that could just be me getting use to the touchscreen and the way this one functions also while swiping is easy i did grow use to using the buttons on the side of my old kindle to turn the page as my fingers were already there so i barely had to moveoverall it is a great product and a worthy replacement my prejudice and star reduction is mostly related to being more comfortable with some of the features of my older one i would recommend one especially if you do a lot of book reading i check out lots of kindle books from my library so that is an added plus,this was a nice replacement of my older kindle which i dropped recently
4.0,i wish it has a dim back light so i could read in the dark and wont be woken by my fiancé really can read it in the light and super light weight,no back light 
4.0,i got this for the black friday price which is a good price point for a gift for my 8 year old daughter we travel a lot and this is the perfect way for her to load some books without the bulk of real books i like having my own tablet without having to loan it to her this one truly is hers and its fun for her to borrow books from the kindle lending library were prime members at this price if something happens to this kindle its not a big investment its good for what shes using it for which is only books,great tablet for my daughter
4.0,i can download books in an instant no more going to bookstores and the limited selection hoping something will catch my eye whats not to like,wish id bought it sooner
5.0,its been over a month since i purchased my kindle and im so impressed with the battery life aside from the initial charge i have yet to have to charge itthe ads dont bother me as much as i thought they wouldthe cover on my case helps a lot with that by covering the screensaver adswith the 15 bucks i saved by getting the ads i was able to purchase a nice case ,love my kindle
3.0,i did not realize it did not have lighting i wrongly assumed all ereaders were usable in any lighting conditions its to dark and hard to read,dark
5.0,just got this kindle and i am sooo happy to have it reading with this device is so much easier on the eyes than a tablet i would highly recommend for anyone who reads a lot the size is great and it is so light i am more than pleased,just got this kindle and i am sooo happy to have it

4.0,good,four stars
5.0,this and the paper white and i think the voyager the kindles with the ink paper screens are really the only kindles worth buying they are great for reading in conditions like outside when other screens are impossible to read i took my kindle to egypt it was great very small and light and i could read it outdoors i love it but i also have a samsung tablet i hate those ads that compare the kindle fire with the ipad they only compare very basic and superficial things like weight but not important things kindle fires are not tablets on the same level as an ipad or a samsung tab style or tab 4 or even a tab 3 i use my kindle for reading and only reading in conditions i cannot use my samsung tablet i use my samsung for reading when i will be in places where i can from that screen and know i will be using my tablet and dont want to carry both but i would never buy a kindle fire in the place of a real tablet i would also recommend buying the kindle from best buy which ironically often has it cheaper and at best buy you can try any tablet before you buy it,the only kindle worth buying
5.0,good,five stars
4.0,this is my second kindle and it came in spanish with no directions on how to convert to english my husband tried for two days and finally got iti was extremely disappointed that there was no directions it is working now but i think written directions should be included ,kindle
5.0,good,five stars
5.0,the touchscreen is sensitive but i have not had the issues that others have had where wind makes the page turn i have found that clothing can turn a page thoughit is so much smaller than the kindle 2nd generation that i had that took a little getting used to as well as the touchscreen for highlighting and taking notes i love the simple look though and not all the extra stuff that distracts from the page at hand when reading its more like reading a page out of a book than my previous kindlei will definitely get a cover for it so i feel comfortable toting it around with mei love having a kindle it has encouraged me to read more and also makes reading larger books less intimidating and easier to read wherever i am at i have the kindle app on my phone and use the kindle cloud reader sometimes at work when i have forgotten my kindle as long as i have synced since my last read on a different device it makes it super easy to change devices to read the same book i love thati am not really a fan of the special offers i have accidentally more than once in the last month that i have had the kindle almost bought a book or something else that pops up on the screen saver as well as in my home menu next time i will definitely pay the extra in order not to have the special offers,i love the simple look though and not all the extra 
5.0,ive read using the kindle app on my ipad for years and felt no need for a dedicated kindle but i loved the battery life my husbands kindle had so on prime day i decided to buy one i wish i had bought it years ago its small and light enough to fit in my purse it stays charged forever and its really pleasant to read from i just wish apple and amazon would work something out so i could put my ibooks on my kindle,finally bought one
5.0,i love this kindle i have an ipad and an iphone but i wanted a device that would only be used for books i didnt want the kindle fire because i need something with the batter power to last as long as this kindles doesit doesnt light up i specifically chose this kindle because of that lighted screens would detract from battery life this device will go a month on a single chargei love the touch screen and font sizer do i sometimes fumble and turn a page yeah but so what i can simply turn back to where i was no big deal my son has an older model kindle and the thumb pad directional button is annoying to mein my opinion for the money and features you cant beat this generation of kindle if you just want a reliable longlasting device for reading look no further skip the bells and whistles lets read a book,simplicity and functionality at a great price
5.0,as a first user of this kindle i can say that this item full fill my expectations is easy to read my favorites books and save them up into the cloud thats make that the internal memory no need to be used,is easy to read my favorites books and save them up 
5.0,amazing i thought the small size in comparison to the kindle keyboard gen2 my previous kindle would dampen reading for me but it still has the right size for text and correcting to your preferences very light simple to look at and very nice much more cost effective to get this kindle and a 15 case with a light than it wouldve been to get the kindle paperwhite 50 dollar difference for a backlight and then buy a 25 dollar caseno complaints so far love it a lot,amazing i thought the small size in comparison to 
4.0,wish the kindle keyboard was still available i am older and touch screens are not my favorite i do love reading on this but sometimes have a problem with the page turning being able to enlarge the print is great i bought one for my great grandson and he loves it and does not have the problem with the touchscreen younger generation you know my keyboard kindle is still usable and when this one needs to be charged i just read on the old one love it,i am older and touch screens are not my favorite i do love reading on this but sometimes 
4.0,i have been using the kindle app for some time and i finally decided i wanted a dedicated ereader with the eink to avoid glare this is the first kindle ive bought so i went with the basic model it does exactly what i want it to do no bells and whistles i got the special offers model and they are not invasive at all i kind of wish id gotten the voyage with the builtin light but my bf got me a reading light which works very well,i have been using the kindle app for some time

3.0,since this is my fourth kindle i obviously love kindles i dont like the fact that theyre continually being updated making the kindle and its accessories obsolete i have a beautiful leather cover for my first one which i cant use anymore because it doesnt fit the newer ones i dont like the touch screen on the new kindle much of that can be remedied by my getting used to the new features the screen is much more sensitive than id like i touch it accidentally often when im just reading or when im carrying it to another room it doesnt just go to the next page it moves several pages ahead or back so then i have to find my place againive wondered about getting my original kindle refurbished do you do that for customers at any rate i have no intention of giving up my kindle i love the availability of hundreds of books and the convenience of carrying one small volumethank youdorothy mcintosh,7th generation kindle
2.0,this is my 3rd kindle the script is easier to read but navigating is seriously more difficult than my second kindle there are fewer prompts and their meanings are difficult to decipher a written instruction sheet would also be very helpful,this version of the kindle is inferior
2.0,my original kindle died when i called to see if it could be fixed the person i spoke with said no and suggested this would be very close to the one i had it is not close at all i will in time get use to it but i am not happy with it,i will in time get use to it but i am not happy with it
3.0,i really like the basic kindle i use it in situations when i dont want to use my ipad i had to replace my last basic kindle and wasnt really needing a touchscreen but that is the only choice now i have found that the touchscreen can be problematic it frequently highlights text that i have no interest in highlighting then i cant figure out how to undo the highlighting it seems really sensitive at times and less so at other times it often brings up definitions instead of turning the page i dont need a definition for the word and in addition the screen is segmented into regions for moving forward backward and settings etc it is easy to move forward because over half the screen is used for moving forward but i find that i need to tap on the actual left edge of the screen to go backwards because it sometimes moves forward even if my finger is a tiny bit to the right of the edge i find myself getting frustrated with the device quite frequently overall i can use it but it is not nearly as userfriendly as the previous basic model,not as userfriendly as the previous basic kindle
4.0,very nice product it is very easy to hold and read the screen image is excellent and can be enhanced by the individual user by selecting alternate line spacing font style and font size navigation through the various features takes some time to learn and with which to become proficient the price when considering all the features available to the use is outstanding i purchased for the for reading only models with additional features while undoubtedly important to some users were of little or no interest to me my on complaint is the list of book categories the list ends with romance and there is no way that i can determine to scroll the listing to science math and science fiction fantasy categories i have had contact with the kindle help desk and they believed that there should be a way to scroll to these groupings in that regard a new kindle was shipped to be on the belief that the unit in my possession was somehow defective the new unit arrived and i performed the initial start up routines only to find that the same issue still existed i have decided to keep the unit and accept the shortcoming of being able to scroll further through the book categories i can type in the topics and then make a selection while this is a bit inconvenient it is acceptable when weighing the inconvenience against the excellent pricing i give the unit three and onehalf stars,very nice product it is very easy to hold and 
1.0,very disappointed i could not get it to connect to my high speed network at home after one hour and 22 minutes on the phone a supervisor finally told me i had been sent a kindle that was not updated and that they would be sending me a new updated version i though i was buying the latest version why else would i be replacing my old paperwrite i was told i was but i hadnt been sent the latest updated version that doesnt make sense to me and my trust level in amazon took a big dive i bought a new paperwrite thinking i was buying the latest version only to be told i was sent an old not updated one i guess we will see what i get when it arrives i had to reminder her i was on prime and it should get here with the 2 day service also the first man i talked to was very nice and tried to help he had to finally turn me over to a supervisor who was overly sweet and extremely condescending so condescending that when she said she would help walk me through how to print out the return tag on my computer because i probably didnt know how i lost it insulting my intelligence was the last straw after one hour and 22 minutes i love my kindles but my trust in amazon is at an all time low sad,disappointed but time will tell
3.0,i miss my kindle 3 aka ye olde fashioned kindle with keyboard this is lighter and looks tidier just sitting there but typing notes is painful pageturning is glitchy and highlighting is maddening particularly if your hands are a little dry which as a lady in her mid50s living in los angeles pretty much describes mine all the time did i mention i miss my kindle 3 yeah kinda like that,its no kindle 3 and mores the pity
5.0,although i miss the feature of audio that was available on my old kindle this one with the touchscreen display has more desirable features such as the ease and speed of page turning and the easier accessibility of the word dictionary other new features i am beginning to learn to use more effectively all in all i really like this new kindle and find it a joy to use,all in all i really like this new kindle and find it a joy to 
5.0,for what it is its a nice compact reader at a very reasonable price it preforms exactly as advertised i bought this as a backup device just to keep in the car in case i stop at a food place and want something to read while eating if this was the only reader you had you might be disappointed because it does not hold a candle to the kindle fire for one thing it is a reader only and you can not surf the web it does not have a colored screen and no back light so you you need an alternate source of light to read in the dark and you can not download appson itall that being said the best feature is the low price and that you can read it in bright sunlight which you can not do very easily with the fire and its a lot more compact and easier to carry than a regular book,new kindle 6 glarefree touchscreen
5.0,i am so happy with kindle since i love to read and i know there no more room in my house for anymore books in the house i mentioned to my sweetie how i would love to have a kindle the kindle was one of my christmas gifts i use my kindle almost daily,i love my kindle

2.0,wait i like the kindle but i do not like buying one and being automatically signed up for amazons kindle unlimited and then having to remember to come back and cancel it before they keep charging my credit card monthly if i want kindle unlimited let me check a box or sign up after 30 days dont tell me you are just going to start auto charging i am getting tired of this sneaky corp crap keep it up and i may decide i dont need a kindle or amazonugh and what is this promotional amount that results in a deferred payment when i try to check out is this a layaway plan or something where was any of that explained in the kindle page,i like the kindle but amazon is making the purchase less than easy
5.0,my kindle has been fantastic the touch page turner works well the display reads like a bookno eyestrain i also like that it has synced up with all the books i had been reading on the kindle app on my phone except the kindle is much easier to read from than my phone,my kindle has been fantastic the touch page turner works well
5.0,i have had this kindle for about a week now and it is great lightweight easy to use and fun the prices are pretty good and they have a good selection of books magazines and singles i charged it as soon as i opened the box and it still has more than half battery on it very simple and great product definitely recommend it,so far so good
4.0,my husband gave this to me for my birthday i am still figuring out all it does or does not do only problem so far is the screen i am in the old lady age group so i could have used the paperwhitei kept trying to find a way to adjust the brightness but of course there is nonei do really like that there is a way to adjust font size so my only warning is to make sure that you like the screen lighting,i do really like that there is a way to adjust font size
3.0,maybe i was just to accustomed to my old keyboard kindle but i preferred it to this one the screen is so touchy it is so easy to lose my place im sure after i get used to it i will love it as much as i loved my old one however i thought i ordered the one without the special offers but came with a free album,it is so easy to lose my place
5.0,love it but am still trying to learn all the ins and outs of how to move back and forth between readings i have every day with jesus read your bible through in a year and need to learn how to move from the daily reading back to the book i am reading but certainly do love the glarefree touchscreen thank you for this updated product,great product
5.0,my daughter gave me her kindle about five or six months ago i had my own but it wasis very old and the buttons wore out the kindle she gave me was wonderful i loved it i used it constantly every day from the day she gave it to me up until yesterday i was laying in my bed reading after getting home from work just as i usually do just before sleeping and i drifted off id let the kindle slip out of my hand and drop to the floor i snapped awake immediately and grabbed the devise up only to see that the screen had cracked i was and am devastated id already felt lucky as could be to own one of these to begin with and was extremely thankful to my daughter for giving it to me as i seriously cant afford to buy one for myself when i saw that screen and tried to make it work right again i had to come to the conclusion that this awesome piece of equipment was truly dead it was the only gadget i owned and i really loved it being able to buy the occasional book or borrow one from the library to read on it and slip it conveniently almost anywhere just like a paperback was my greatest of simple pleasures i miss it already and am looking forward to maybe being able to set aside some money out of next years income tax return to hopefully get another,good old friend
5.0,simple light weight no glare long battery life if you read this in a dark place then you would be better off getting the model above which is the paperwhite with the backlight also i get the nyt newspaper app and my only complaint is that it doesnt download until later on in the day instead of first thing in the morning,if you read this in a dark place then you would be better off getting the model above which is the paperwhite

4.0,its great except for the amazon of loading and adding foreign language dictionaries to cloud which i will never use and which because there are alphabetizd they are scattered among the books which i have saved to cloud being a nuisance when i search for a book ive previously saved to cloud your policy should be to ask if the user wishes any of those dictionaries and not impose them arbitrarily or at least enable the person to delete them entirely from cloud,please no imposed foreign language dictionaries
5.0,these things are great brig a senior i do have to say one thing i personally like the button control over touch screen way to easy to acidentaly touch the screen and page forward or back several pages i went forward a few chapters one time if i could have the buttons and lighted screen would be great gary,these things are great brig a senior i do have to say 
4.0,i bought this to replace my third broken kindle device i know its crazy but i like the device so much that i decided to replace it againwhen i contacted customer service they were very helpful but only offered the version that is backlit or a kindle fire as a replacement i do wish the screens were less fragile apparently the slightest mishap can irreparably damage the screen so ive decided to bite the bullet replace the device and treat it like its made of eggshells wish me luck,i know its crazy but i like the device so much that i decided to replace 
2.0,amazon pay attentionwhat is wrong with your company this product sucks it is laggy slow pixelated too simple no color options no built in light overpriced weak and disrespectful to the potential of your the employees that seem to be working 6085 hours per week when you expect so much from the people that work for you how is it possible for you to conceive such a weak product and price it at almost 100 dollars i have read the forbes 50 greatest leaders article on jeff bezos and the new york times article on amazons violent work culture as a valued customer i always respect amazon as the premier online retailer and as an investor i am proud that jeff bezos amazon breaks the mold as share prices rise however a product like this is evidence towards the ineffectiveness of your company culture performance reviews against mothers cancer patients discouraging dealing with family crisis and mandatory cuts of regular employee reviews are illogical actions resulting in cutting valuable employees high turnovers lack of fairnessunderstanding toward females bust most savage of all is the failure the company leadership president obama once spoke about the challenges in getting congress to cooperate and someone said that leaders go first please take care of the people that work for you and please improve your retail products a chinese knockoff can do better,amazon you need to pay attention
4.0,setup was a little frustrating this is my 6th kindle the last one lasted almost 2 years but even in the hard cover the screen still went crazyi am hoping this one lasts longer i love the convenience of having so many books on one small devicethe reading is easy on the eyes still find getting to the controls a little hard but the actual reading is easy,i love the convenience of having so many books on one

5.0,i had never bought one of these before so i was hesitant about getting one i had so many ebooks stored on my computer it was slowing it down i had to buy one out of necessity i thought it was going to be difficult to get all my books on it but it was so easy the instructions are so simple to follow and it pretty much walks you right through the setup and installation process the battery life lasts a long time as i dont think ive put it down for more than an hour since i got it i put it on charge at bedtime and the battery after a full day of reading has barely been used i highly recommend this product especially in the bundle pack for anyone who is addicted to reading books i cant believe i waited so long to get one,perfect for people who love to read

5.0,i have had this for a week and love it so far i had a second generation kindle for years before it finally died i definitely got all the life out of it this new kindle is everything i love about the old one except with a touch screen since i already own a smart phone i had no need for another device with a bunch of apps i just wanted something to read on this was a perfect purchase for that great on battery life you do need a light source to read on and i am fine with that because i like to read in bed and backlighting tends to mess me with my sleep cycles,great purchase

3.0,the screen is very dark there is no backlight and i feel like im going blind reading it on the other hand it is much more comfortable to use a small device like this than to be stuck in one position for a long period of time reading on the kindlepc,get the paperwhite instead
2.0,the previous kindle that i owned had a keyboard so that i was able to play games with it which i enjoyed very much especially sudoku so you can imagine my disappointment when this one arrived and there was no keyboard two thirds of the enjoyment that i had had with my previous kindle was gone i havent figured out as yet what to do with it any suggestions, was able to play games with it which i enjoyed very much especially sudoku
5.0,love it especially the non glare screen and built in light i can read in sunlight if i need to read when i cant sleep at night i just turn the kindle o no need for a lamp it is fantastic to use,paperwhite kindle review
5.0,this is our second kindle i am still learning all the capabilities it is handier than our original kindle it shortens some of the procedure password to commence is not required the longer battery life is nice it is a little harder to delete a sample or book,the longer battery life is nice it is a little harder to delete a 
5.0,a perfect simple reader it is i love how neat and light it is its touchscreen works much better than that on nook simple touch i used to have an experimental browser works fine too one of my fav functions is the ability to send docs via email the device syncs fast and smoothly i feel like there are many more functions i just need to take my time and discover them overall great experience,no glitches great experience
5.0,i have owned a kindle since they came out i just upgraded my first kindle to the 6 glarefree i like that there is no back light easier on my eyes i also like that everything i read is on the kindle no more books at different sizes or struggling to keep a paperback open the second most important feature is the letter sizing i am able to adjust the lettering to i dont have a hard time seeing it i find i read more now than ever great product for the price,love my kindle glare free

4.0,just really started playing with it but can tell you that it is fast and the screen resolution is excellent changed from an original 7 fire to this and was worried about the size making it tough to read but the higher resolution more than makes up for it strikes me as a good deal for the price and im glad i bought it, that it is fast and the screen resolution is excellent changed from an original 7 fire to this

4.0,as someone who loves to read in their free time the amazon kindle has been an awesome product for me this product is very durable and efficient as i have already dropped it a couple of times and it does not have a scratch on it it has been wonderful to have all of my reading materials magazines books and newspapers in one place it will also be very helpful for family vacations and for my parents to take on business trips it has been very convenient to always have one item where my reading materials are stored the battery life has also been outstanding lasting almost weeks at a time compared to other products on the market there is no glare on the screen when you are reading in the sun this made a huge difference to me as i do most of my reading outsidetechnology aspecti am someone who does not need to have all the apps and games that some products offer with their reading devices so if you are someone who is tech savvy this product might not be for you it is very straightforward and easy to use which makes it perfect for me as i have never been very good with technologykid friendly in my opinion if you are looking for an ereader do some research before you purchase the product i thought the kindle was a good value for the price of 7999 as there are many different kindle products and competitor products that are much more expensive this is especially if you are looking for an ereader for a child you may have hesitated before because of the price with this model only being 79 you may have found your perfect product one bonus is that the screen size is the same as the other kindle devices so you are not losing out on that if that is something that is important to youone thing to keep in mind is that there is no buttons besides a power button turning the page is as easy as taping the side of the screenin comparison to other products this amazon kindle has been perfect for me because it is easy to use easy to read in the sun and easy to store when taking it places,good value and easy to use

1.0,this new touch screen is the worst thing i have ever seen sometimes it turns one page sometimes two sometimes 10 sometimes you dont know how many and cant find your place once a tap sent it to the end of the book giving the references you can accidently touch a word with your left hand and this 34 screen thing pops up trying to define a word etc and there is no obvious way to get rid of itthe old buttons of the side was reliablei am throwing this in the trash today,turn one page or 10

5.0,i got this for my wife who could not understand why anyone would want to read from an electronic device she goes through a couple of books a week i figured if she didnt use it i would try it and and give my older model away if i liked this one better it turns out my wife loves the kindle so no upgrade for me this makes packing for trips much easier now she has a selection of books to read and we dont have to carry 2 3 paperbacks while traveling,new ebook lover in training
4.0,very easy to hold and read even with one hand  still getting used to operations but think that a pamphlet with instructions would have been more helpful rather than having to search it on the kindle did buy one as a gift think it is a most affordable present for the holidays,very easy to hold and read even with one hand
4.0,i bought this kindle to replace an earlier model that i stolen i cant say i like it better than my old kindle but it does have some feature that were not on my old kindle the best of these is that you can set it up so that it requires a passcode to use it if this had been on my old kindle i might have got it back my old model used buttons to advance pages while on this kindle use swipe your finger on the screen i did not like this at first but after getting using it for a while i find that is ok the only problem is that on rare occasions it skips a number of pages so you to go back to find your place,a good replacement for a old kindle
5.0,reading has always been my passion i was 4 when my mother started to take me to the library when in 2013 after many eye surgeries i had difficulty reading i purchased my firstkindle paperwhite it is wonderful being able to adjust type size and contrast and having such a great choice of reading material made such a difference i may soon may be purchasing anotherplus heres a littleknown benefit for those of us who live where there are frequent power outages whether manmade or weatherrelated you can keep reading when the power goes out does anyone out there remember sneaking a silverandblack flashlight with sizs d batteries under the cover so that they could keep reading after lightsouti think i might be buying another kindle paperwhite in the near futurefyi there are many outofcopyright books available for free download,paperwhite is great for visually or mobilityimpaired people
5.0,no bothersome glare to bother my early cataracts totay readable in direct sunlight havent had to recharge the battery since i got it and did the initial overnight charge two weeks ago totally affordable,its perfect for older eyes
5.0,it is exactly what i expected and im glad i ordered it the touch screen upgrade is so much better than the button version the case also seems sturdier for an economical and compact e reader this one meets all my needs,it is exactly what i expected and im glad i ordered it
5.0,awesome product battery last long easy to use great for reading outdoors youll need light at all times seeing as its the model that doesnt come with illumination take into consideration the size and the fact that its only black and white when deciding the types of books youd like to read if youre looking to just read books and dont mind that images are black and white then this is for you i have a couple of paracord books that would look better and be easier to follow if in color but that doesnt keep me from still going back to it time and time again,my first kindle and im very happy with it its nice to get back into reading again
5.0,it is a great upgrade from the previous version the touch screen is pretty good took a minute to figure out a couple of the new features overall if youd like an inexpensive kindle this would be it the only thing that bugs me is that it doesnt have the contact points for an external light like the old one for the lighted case small issue,great product for the price
5.0,these kindles are sleep safe the blue light from backlit tablets and ereaders disturbs your sleep and are not good to read in bed this range of kindles uses ambient light and wont affect your pineal gland,sleep safe reader
5.0,i bought this as a replacement for my old kindle that died i love the kindle the variety of books available the cost of the books the ease of ordering and the fact that i can have a library of thousands of books in a light notebook,love my kindle
5.0,i bought the kindle after much deliberation at the suggestion of a friend i had wanted to start reading books electronically but found that reading them on an ipad or my computer monitor was simply a disastrous notion as my eyes would quickly become dry itchy and tired i did a lot of research online and saw that the technology behind the kindle screen was much different but the idea of a screen that does not keep refreshing itself was odd to me i thought it would just look like the slowmoving screen of my old palm pilotto my surprise this device is absolutely amazing as long as the lighting is adequate it is just like reading a book the battery holds a charge for a long long time and the software a detail which a nerd like me cares about is actually quite fullfeatured you can make purchases directly from the device you can connect it to your goodreads account and it even has a modest builtin web browser basically it includes some completely painlessly functioning online features that make it a pleasure to use if i buy books on my computer the next time i open the kindle it immediately loads the new items into its inventorythe kindle has exceeded my expectations in every conceivable way,i love this device
5.0,easy to use and easy to read through this version of the kindle doesnt have all the bells and whistles on it which is exactly what i needed a library for when i am away from home the software on it is straight forward and easy to use,five stars
5.0,love this thing got it on sale for 4999 and have been reading more than ever dont be fooled by the simplicity and lack of premium features thats exactly what i was looking for any more and i can easily get distracted battery lasts forever too,just basic is just right
3.0,i lost my previous kindle and had to purchase a new one i thought i was buying the identical product but what i didnt know is that amazon had remodeled this item so that it was a little bulkier and more importantly felt like cheap plastic in my hands that last kindle was a little sleeker and had more of a satin kind of finish when youre holding it which youre going to be doing for an awfully long time if you read a lot i would see if i could buy some backstock of the old model at a similar or perhaps cheaper price if you have the optionreally the point of this review is to provide amazon with feedback that they should pay more attention to the feel of kindle in the hand this thing looks and feels like a piece of cheap junk it does perform just as well as the previous iteration however which cant be understated its still a marvel of an ereader despite the step back in quality,works as advertised but new finish is cheap and unwieldy
5.0,ive had my kindle for a few days now since the release date so 5 days total and so far i absolutely love it i was skeptical of the touchscreen but i find that i actually like it much more than the previous kindle it has a swipetoopen feature to unlock the device in addition to the button on the bottom of the deviceits not bad but i feel its a bit redundant when theres a button to unlock the device as well it also has parental controls which is a nice touch for those who have kids that like to go purchasing things with 1click the setup is just like the previous generation kindle paperwhite which is very clean and well organized in my personal opinionthe casing feels a bit cheap it doesnt have the smooth back like the previous generation kindle did which i was a fan of other than the casing i love the device and would recommend it to anyone looking into an ereader i would suggest a clipon light to go along with it if youre one who likes to read in bed but dont want to spend the extra money for a builtin light,much improved
5.0,this was a birthday present i initially did not want one and then my sister gave me my present and oh boy i am a book lover and as much as i love hard copies i have to say this kindle is heaven sent my husband loves it he thinks ill stop by the old fashioned hardbound type,im a believer
5.0,this little device is amazing granted ive not owned many ereaders im still very happy with the product serves my purposes greatlyif you havent used an ereader before theyre pretty fancy they lack the tactile appeal of a book and permanence but are a great way to have a whole library at your fingertipsthat combined with the ability to email yourself documents makes it a perfect companion product for a student on the go,this little device is amazing granted ive not owned many ereaders

4.0,its very light weight which i like i do wish the screen could be lightened so i could read in bed at night without lights being turned on so i use my kindle fire at night and the ereader during the day,light weight makes it nice
5.0,i am a huge fan of books i love everything about them so didnt think i would like a kindle i received one as a gift now i cant imagine not having this love it its easy to bring with anywhere and even easier to read in bed although i like to prop it up on a blanket or pillow i havent found the perfect pillow holder for it yet,i love everything about them
2.0,i owned a first model kindle it was very easy to use it died i bought this new model i do not like it everything is touch screen ugh the slightest touch and zipwham now it wants to reset the font now what to do answer touch the screen where it not me wants you to touch if you should you touch the wrong place and it will zipwham go somewhere else the kindle user guide is also does not answer the simple question how to move back a page two stars,i want to buy the old model
5.0,the way the display looks like paper is so cool the rendering on this is super slow and it makes viewing pdf documents difficult because of the lag between scrollingpinching and the screen updating 5 stars anyway because im thoroughly enjoying reading ebooks on this,the way the display looks like paper is so cool
5.0,dropped my 3rd generation kindle around thanksgiving but i was still able to see the page when i increased the font then you guessed it the blackness spread until i could no longer read nor operate the kindle i read the reviews for the kindle 7 especially the one and 2 starred reviews and with no choice i purchased the kindle 7 no need for the backlight or the fire just wanted to read i was so apprehensive about the newer kindle that i dreaded opening the box not sure the people that wrote a 1 or 2 star review actually purchased the same reader because the instructions were so simple and maybe just maybe the whole ordeal of opening the box setting up the wifi and downloading my books took 15 minutes everything worked the cloud is easy to access pages are simple to turn if you are an avid reader you can turn off the annoying dictionary its an option not a necessity the kindle is a pleasure to read a book turn a page find a page or adjust the settings the main reason i gave the kindle a 5 star rating is because my wife and i can now read and download each others books what a great improvement sharing a book there are many improvements havent gotten to them all as of this moment but when i do i will realize again and again what a great reader this 7th generation is to own ps the price was right as well,best kindle ever
5.0,bought it as a gift for my daughter and she loves it maybe i missed it upon ordering it but maybe it should be bundled to include a protective case when first purchased im going to get one for her now but its definitely an awesome buy for the value,awesome value my firstborn loves it

5.0,i love this kindle i originally had the one with the keyboard at the bottom but it eventually died i read every night so i wanted to replace it right away the 6 glarefree touchscreen has met all of my expectations and more it did not take me long to learn the basics and i am still learning as i use it i love the size and it is very lightweight i would highly recommend this kindle if you love to read,if you love readingthis is for you
5.0,i switched from a nook to this kindle and i am very happy with it despite having to replace books lol it is lightweight easy to hold easy to set up the wifi is great on it and i like the interface for personalizing it as well as the option to lock it with a password i got the adfree version and am glad its well worth the extra ,and i am very happy with it despite having to replace books lol
2.0,it keeps changing type style and size in the middle of my reading without my doing anything it is also very hard to get it to go to the correct screen to remove a item from the device i am just not pleased with the way it controls,i am just not pleased with the way it controls
5.0,i am very happy with this kindle easy to operate and easy to read i purchased a folio case for this kindle and really like that the kindle opens when i open the case and closes when i close the case,easy to operate
5.0,i love the new kindle touch i never thought i would use an ereader but the kindle has changed the type of reader i am now i can read anytime even in bed i bought a simple medge light to put in my homemade case i can read anywhere this easily fits in my purse and i can take it when traveling its so light and compact i can read faster no need to figure out what page im on since it stays on the last page i read unless my sons touch it or i touch the wrong part of the screen i can check out library books with just a few steps using the overdrive system my library has which has saved time on these cold days i can read my lessons for my online class by sending them to my kindle using the google chrome tool so much easier than staring at the computer screen i can access daily reflectionsprayers and search for the corresponding bible readings i can let my son use it to read a picture book in black and white i can increase my vocabulary and story understanding by using the dictionary tool to look up words i can connect with friends and read reviews on goodreads i can take advantage of the special offers which hasnt bothered me at all ive had my kindle since christmas and have used it everyday since it charges quickly using the usb with a wall charger i have for my phone and lasts a week for me reading daily the kindle has allowed me to read several series quickly and it is nice to immediately have access to the next book i like the kindle unlimited for now but probably wont have it for long since my library has quite a few books i am interested in i also have plenty to read with my prime membership with the free monthly book from the kindle owners lending library and the kindle first program i am enjoying my kindle and look forward to many more reading adventures with it,love the kindletouch and its easy to use features
5.0,great small enough to fit in a purse and the internet connection hasnt had many issues i havent had any major problems with this kindle the only downside would be that the screen doesnt have a night setting if you are reading in a lowlight room its not completely glarefree but it is close enough for any reader this is the perfect gift for them,best birthday gift
2.0,disappointed in my kindle i havent had it a year yet and already it does not work it will not download any books and the battery runs out in just a few hours i worked great when i first got it i would think it should last more than a year before it dies not impressed i wont buy another one,not really impressed
4.0,easy to hold in onehand and very lightweight also touchscreen is very sensitive performance is good you can email ebook files to your custom kindle email to wirelessly transfer them to the kindle i rated 45 star because it has no backlight if you need that choose kindle paperwhite,best ereader ever
5.0,i love itjust what i was looking for i had the older version and it worked well but the 6 glare free offers some features like the touchscreen that make it easier to look up for definitions or highlight sentences id recommend to anyone,the perfect kindle
1.0,i am extremely dusappointed i had no idea that i would not be able to change the text on the screen even the very first kindle that i got could at least change the size of the text and the kindle fire that i have been using can reverse the background so that the background is black and the text is white i have had vision problems due to my ms for several years and recent cataract surgery has created even more problems for me due to the lens that was used in the surgery i would like to return the kindle that i just purchased and exchange it for a version that allows text changes and background changes and also have a screen that lights up so i can read in a darkened room please advise me as to how to return the kindle that i just purchased and tell me which of the current kindles actually meets my needsi had already downloaded all my books on the new kindle before i discovered its limitations how do i remove my stuff from it before returning it thanks,i would like to return the kindle that i just purchased and 
5.0,all i needed my old kindle had buttons and after so many years the letters wore off the touchscreen is great old kindle still works great though if not for buttons just the perfect e readeris all i needed love it,simple perfection
4.0,the device works fine but it has too many bells and whistles for me also does not have enough margin on the side of the screen i hit the screen accidently because of this lack of space to hold the device next edition should be better engineered,satisfactory but needs work
3.0,no no no you cannot use one hand with the touch screen you have to hold it with one hand and turn the page by touching with the other hand my old kindle had the side bar and the keys at bottom you could hold it with one hand and press the side bar to turn the pagetrue one hand reading you just added things we dont truly want to increase price bring back the side bar without giving us a 200 price tag,not one hand reading
5.0,just got it today totally happy after playing with it for a couple of hours hereread what it says about this kindle folksits exactly as stated no backlight seems to be an issue with some folks but it never says it has onegot it a day earlier than stated nice surprise thanks amazon,totally happy after playing with it for a couple of hours 
5.0,ive had my kindle for a few days now since the release date so 5 days total and so far i absolutely love it i was skeptical of the touchscreen but i find that i actually like it much more than the previous kindle it has a swipetoopen feature to unlock the device in addition to the button on the bottom of the deviceits not bad but i feel its a bit redundant when theres a button to unlock the device as well it also has parental controls which is a nice touch for those who have kids that like to go purchasing things with 1click the setup is just like the previous generation kindle paperwhite which is very clean and well organized in my personal opinionthe casing feels a bit cheap it doesnt have the smooth back like the previous generation kindle did which i was a fan of other than the casing i love the device and would recommend it to anyone looking into an ereader i would suggest a clipon light to go along with it if youre one who likes to read in bed but dont want to spend the extra money for a builtin lightcomment3 people found this helpful was t,and so far i absolutely love it i was skeptical of the touchscreen
3.0,the device itself is fine i ended up with this one because my original kindle would no longer power up what i am dissatisfied with is the customer service and misguided information that i was given the screen on this replacement kindle that i purchased new when my other one failed to turn on anymore is the same but the body is smaller i was told it was the same size and would fit into my leather case and will not fit into my leather case 65 when i bought it for my other kindle so now i have a kindle that is unprotected when not in use until i fork out more money for another cover,dissatisfied
3.0,this was my 4th kindle i have been disappointed in this one as the battery doesnt seem to last as long as the one on my paperwhite even though it is almost exactly the same except for the back light which i had assumed would make this last at least as long if not longer with my paperwhite i was easily able to go a week between chargings and even then i would have a fair charge left while with this i get the pop up telling me i need to charge after 56 days after talking to tech support i turned off the wifi for a couple days and it still depleted the battery by about half in 3 days i have also found the touch screen to be a bit touchier than my paperwhite if i am not careful it will flip a couple pages at a time and i have had issues with it leaning against a blanket and popping up the text resize menu for reading the screen is just fine and everything i have come to expect from my kindles it is just the issue with the battery and the touchyness of the screen that bugs me oh and make sure you really dont care about having the lit screen i got this thinking i didnt really need it but it didnt take long before i decided i was missing it i am going to best buy today to get myself a paperwhite to replace this one have to get somewhere else because amazon seems to have the paperwhite backordered at the moment,good but a few disappointments
5.0,it came quickly and already set up for me i love how easy it is to access amazon s selection of books i am kind of disappointed that the wall charger comes seperate where as the barnes and noble nook comes with one but over all im very satisfied with it,i love how easy it is to access amazon s 
3.0,small light easy to carry around i dont find it that much simple to use for example changing size of letters or even returning to home page while reading a book overall is a good deal for addicted readers,overall is a good deal
2.0,its usable but after a week or sos solid use am badly missing my old non touch screen kindle if you still have a usable one are thinking to upgrade keep hold of it until you have tried this version for a while there are 2 main problems for me both affect my reading experience daily so far1 although smaller its significantly heavier and fatter than my old kindle this together with the touch screen rather than button page turning makes it difficult to read with one hand if you love to read in bed lying on your side like me this is a big issue theres only one awkward to hold position you can use and you can still find yourself accidentally going backwards rather than forwards or randomly changing the text size or exiting the book without intending to sure a paper book is hard to read with one hand too but thats what one of things that made the old kindle so great and stopped me buying paper books overnight2 very easy to change text size accidentally happens dailyon the plus sidethe searching in kindle store is much easier with touch screen than using the keyboard on old kindlestill much prefer the old non touch screen one though just because the ease of use for reading in one hand is so much better,miss my old kindle
5.0,bought this for my 93 year old motherinlaw who has macular degeneration she was worried about using it as she has never used technology on her own she loves it she can make the print large enough to read and we can add books for her her neighbor takes it to the library to use the wifi when we add books,bought this for my 93 year old motherinlaw who has 
5.0,this little device has renewed my love of reading i preferred the basic model without the light since i would never read in the dark anyway so why spend the money the text is clear and it downloads the books really fast i was amazed at how many books were free through amazon as well i actually like the ads on the sleep screen since they look neat and some will pique my interest easier to hold than a traditional paperback and quicker page turns without licking your fingers,this little device has renewed my love of reading
1.0,this came with a 2 year square trade warranty it sucks and i feel scammed first amazon sends a voucher email with code to activate the warranty absolutely no info on how to actual activate the warranty no link then you call amazon and wait on hold and they tell you try squaretrade you go to their website and try to register but once you say its an amazon kindle it creates a loop where you cannot login create an account and activate i then call squaretrade and after numerous prompts they say to call back when they arent so busy with other callsabsolute scamoh and i bought this unit because my last kindle died after having it 88 days amazon doesnt count warranty from date of delivery or date of activation they count from the ship date would they honor the kindle warranty on the 88th day of use of a 90 day warranty no i escalated twice to managers and they offered a 10 voucher off a new onei would like to provide mr bezos the same service as he has given me if hed give me the opportunity,lousy service cannot make up for great technology
5.0,i had the original version which made it through several trips to the jungles of papua new guinea before finally retiring this one has fewer buttons and is much easier to operate the no glare screen is really terrific,the no glare screen is really terrific
5.0,the printing press is one of the major advancements in the history of mankind prior to the internet it was the innovation that allowed for the sharing of information on a large scale books steadily became more affordable and were more widely available read we had carnegie who established a a trust for the construction of public libraries where anyone could access the information that heretofore had been limited editions and expensive to acquire in the united states reading became the most cherished of educational acquired skills everyone read it was and continues to be a major exchange media for news sports and in many cases advertising every so often an innovation comes along that expands the frontiers of information the kindle is simply the next logical step in the evolution of technology it retains the look size and feel of a traditional paperback in size and heft but it is capable of a veritable library within its small frame and even more so when cloud storage is considered the elements of the screen controls font size and brightness are literally at your finger tips it holds a charge for days you can hold it in one hand quite comfortably and its heft is no more than a medium sized paperback it has many more features all neatly spelled out on the information page at amazon what you are looking for is some assurance or feedback from people who actually own a kindle paper white i never intentionally set out to acquire a kindle but after sitting on the fence and looking at the many readers available i went with amazon kindle why it was a gift so the decision forme was very easy to make i have no regrets not one it is an easy nearly intuitive process to learn i have ten thumbs but i quickly adjusted to the feel and touch of the screen i wouldnt sell it if i was offered the same price i paidnow if you would throw in a few hundred for it well i can adjust i can also buy another one pocket the balance and be quite content the point is i would buy another one thats how much i enjoy it okay i wont gush about it just buy it try it if you read for any length of time you will soon forget the format you are holding in your hand page turning is simply a flick you only have one page at a time i know some folks who were so used to having two pages left and right they were actually uneasy about it they hung in there and both now own a kindle they might of purchased two one for the right hand page and another for the left hand page which would make them at ease but i never inquired further now wisheswell all books just ought to have the kindle version available it ought to be less expensive sure it costs less but considering the elimination of long term overhead costs youd think it would be even less thats itone there should be a kindle format available for each book two yes were greedy we want more for less but thats my only negative comments about the kindle formatting and prices hardware functionality a would i buy another yes i would would i recommend it to a friend or as a gift for a friend yes with no reservations there is a lot of media for no costs to the user a lot of old books no longer under copyright which are just as true as they were a hundred years agoand we still havent learned a thing in many aspects there are also free programs that convert pdf into a kindle or kindle paper white format that will open up opportunities even more books for free one last thing pictures will be displayed in blackwhitegray and that tint of ctr dont expect vibrant colors its different but again not a big deal to me try it i think youll enjoy it,makes a great gift even if you decide to keep it and give them an old restaurant gift card you havent used instead
5.0,i love this device i previously had a nook and made the switch to the kindle since i am a prime member i couldnt be more pleased with the device and all the options so easy to use the only thing i wish it had and maybe it does but i just cant find it is a dashboard with how fast i read books,beautiful device great options
4.0,the operating system is a bit underwhelming and not the easiest thing to use the covers of the books are very difficult to read what book it is youre trying to open so if you dont recognize the picture youre in trouble beyond that the device is excellent i love using in any conditions though i wish it had a backlight i definitely would recommend it great bang for your buck,beyond that the device is excellent i love using in any conditions
5.0,my son loves to read i always struggle with all the books he carries in his backpack we got him the is kindle for his birthday and he couldnt be happier the backpack is a lot lighter nowhe keeps track of his own reading and i personally love the clues that appear automatically in the reading according to his age,best present for my 11 year old son
4.0,having had a few kindle readers i like this one a lot screen quality is excellent unbeateable i would say great battery life only drawback is that you can easily flip pages inadvertently as the screen is very sensitive to any touch,great device a bit sensitive screen
5.0,this is an excellent product for someone who just wants to read like me its light and doesnt bother the eyes like many other devices feels like reading a book also since i started using it ive been reading a lot more still i wont stop reading non digital books but this is very helpful,this is an excellent product for someone who just wants to read
5.0,love it i had a fire but found most of the features were redundant with my notebook and ipad although the user interface was inferior this is exactly what i needed a small pocket sized device that i can use to read both indoors and out,best reader with no ancillary features that are not needed
5.0,love this device it honestly feels like a padd device from star trek the next generation the navigation is a little awkward at first but after a short amount of time you should be able to navigate through everything with no problem well worth the price during the valentines day sale,love this device
4.0,it is light and easy to use i do wish that i had bought the paperwhite instead so i could switch to a backlight at night it was very difficult to find a cover with a light i had to order one from england to get a cover with an attached light,it is light and easy to use
5.0,the kindle users guide which can be accessed on the kindle contains clear and complete instructions on how to use the kindle in addition the kindle program for purchasing books is user friendly,userfriendly kindle
5.0,the battery lasts an incredibly long time and the display is everything i could expect from a reader the internet browser works its not a tablet but the browser does fairly well as an extra feature the word lookupdictionary feature is also really great and i find my self using it very often if youre in the market for a reader i would reccomend this one whole heartedly,awesome reader
5.0,love it i never had a kindle reader before and was really looking forward to owning one and using it when i got this one i used it right a way and really loved it now i take it with me to the gym and read using it while im on the bike or some other activity that does not require concentration much really recommend it one thing i found that could use some improvement is that the resolution is not perfect i think it could be better for sure,highly recommended
5.0,i really like it it is more user friendly than my kindle wkeyboard as far as searching for new books i also like the touch screen versus the side page turn buttons i was always hitting buttons accidentally while holding it and i dont have that problem with this it is smaller so it fits in my purse a little better the screen is easy and clear to read on this type of kindle is easier on my eyes than a backlit screen which is why i stuck with the original type of kindlei do have to mention that after a little looking around i was unable to find a case with a light in it for this version i m going to take a look at the paper white due to this reason although i really love this kindle touch the unavailability of a lighted case will likely change my mind about it,i really like it it is more user friendly than my 
5.0,you may argue that you can read it over phone but the point is that kindle is made for books for people who look to build in their own library it may or may not be worth but definitely for me i carry my library with me,digital is the way to go
2.0,not crazy about this model the touch screen is not particularly sensitive and i find myself having to try twice to turn pages also if i bobble it or set it down wrong the font switches from smaller to the largest size have constantly had to reset font overall this model feels and acts much more cheaply made than my 2 previous ereaders wish i had sprung for the paper white,disappointed
4.0,kindle ereader is a fantastic device which is free of any interruptions there are many who may think about the need of this product especially when there are tablets and laptops available to understand the brilliance of this product one has to be a book reader and that too an avid onekindle according to the makers kindle is designed as a dedicated ereader and it make me indulge into my love of reading without the interruptions like email alerts and push notificationsi am simply in love with this product it has become my companion what scores for kindle is that it is lighter than most paperback books making it easy and comfortable to hold in one hand for extended periods of timethe makers claim that there are millions of books including the latest best sellers newspapers and magazines on kindle let me tell you this is not true as many of the editions are not free and easily accessible this said the famous titles will not come free and one has to be willing to spend for books as this is just a comfortable and elegant book reader once you buy you have the eversion of the book which can be referred alwaysi think this product should be made a national product simply because it inculcates the reading habit which is a priced possession for any youngster who today seems to be lost and purposeless less preaching and coming back to the product kindle paperwhite comes in 3 versions but the basic elementary version has all the features at an affordable price kindle is touchscreen and has the typical matte finish which makes it also an eye candy it’s time to get back your habit of reading if you had one and if you didn’t then it’s time to develop one lets kindle,kindle ereader is a fantastic device which is free of any interruptions
5.0,i always thought i was a book purist but i really like the kindle its light to carry and hold in your hand while reading i really bought it to borrow library ebooks this way you can borrow books without the hassle of going to the library,great
5.0,i previously had an old version of a kindle so when that stopped working this was a great replacement its easy to use andthe white back round makes the print jump off the page i prefer to keep all my reading materials on a kindle because of the glare factor when reading outside unlike tablets its never a problem i would recommend this to anyonewhen you place this is a protective case with a cover its like reading any book,recommended to all
2.0,this works very well for my daughterwhen it actually works i love kindles and have bought myself two so far my family and i live overseas in singapore so i got my 9yearold daughter a kindle in order to get access to books we cannot get here as well as for convenience when traveling she loves it but it freezes constantly and take about a day and many tricks to unfreeze it she gets extremely disappointed and frustrated when she is in a good part in her book and then the kindle freezes meaning she must put it aside for at least a day i dont know if this is a glitch with this particular model since ive never had this issue with my kindles and when i search it on forums i find that many others have this issue but they need to look into it and fix it i will be very unhappy if i have to buy her another kindle to replace this one which is only 6 months old,i love kindles and have bought myself two so far
5.0,i was a bit hesitant about getting a kindle—i am one of those readers that cant read without a pen in hand to write on margins as i readnothing beats the feel of a book oalso i didnt want to add another device to my life but after much hesitation i finally made the plunge and i dont regret it i love traveling and having all my books in one place is worth it— i dont have to carry them around because theyre all in my light kindle the eink makes the read pretty smooth and it doesnt hurt the eyes the kindle is a good investment for those of us who travel do lots of commute and want to be able to read lots of books,i love traveling and having all my books in one place 
5.0,lots of nice features such as xray to remind me who the characters are dictionary time left in chapter and book location page number and of course touch page turning  plus it was easy to download books from my first kindle i love it and will be giving it for christmas again,lots of nice features such as xray to remind me who 
5.0,fellow readers i went on the cheap for my 2nd kindle ages ago i had the 2nd gen new300 how times have changed and couldnt be happier no buttons no problem were a point n click society now so it was easy to adapt to the screen tap as for ads who cares its not as if they pop up when youre readingbattery life good nuffscreen way better than my first onewifi only as if youre in need of downloading that book this instant out in the high desert plan ahead maybe bought my 82 yr old mother one and after a few lessons she was up and running if she can do then i dare say you can have not one moment of regret with this little guy that being coupled with my prime im pleased as punch,pleased as punch
5.0,i do like it and it is so convenient to take along on office visits where i have to sit for a time at times fits in my purse so dont have to carry a book along with my appointment book easy to use,i do like it and it is so convenient to take along 
5.0,my first kindle was the original one dont know what you call it but i had a cover with a light i had it for over five years not a lick of trouble but then i dropped it in the parking lot i had to get another one right away so i went to staples my budget only allowed for the smallest paperwhite i love the touchscreen and especially love the dictionary and the xray features the thing about this one is that it is lighter and i am surprised at how much better that is i purchased a cover for 15 bucks which i had to have because i didnt want to break my precious kindle again,my second kindle
5.0,got it on sale and it is a very good reader the only thing it lacks is a lit screen when it gets dark but i knew that when i bought it when i read at night i use the light on my cell phone to read by downloading books is easy it remembers where you left off when you pick it back up i have used it about a week and am on my second book for the money it does a lot and just what it says it will do very nice device i gave it 5 stars because i find it extremely easy to use and read from and always has my page so far it has done everything as advertised,got it on sale and it is a very good reader the only thing it lacks is a 
3.0,while i enjoy reading on my kindle it was very time consuming transferring my books from on kindle to another i was also under the impression that the battery time would last me weeks i have to stop and recharge every 5 days not weeks i do like the way the books go live when you open the cover i think i am just confused by all the touch features,while i enjoy reading on my kindle
5.0,i had my last kindle for years and it was with me through more than 150 books cant say enough good things about this device easy to use and read long battery life ridiculously portable durable with a case encourages reading etc,love my kindle
4.0,i love the size and weight of this unit not being very tech oriented it took me a bit to figure out that the content from my old kindle was in the cloud and not on the device but once i got that down everything else came pretty easy i prefer this unit to the paper white as it is not as hard on the eyes in brightly lit places my kindle goes everywhere with me and this particular unit is lighter in weight which makes transporting it easier,a great new kindle
5.0,my boyfriend bought me a kindle for when i get bored at work and i love it it was very easy to learn how to use it but then again i am very tech savvy i would recommend this to anyone who likes to read and doesnt have space to store a bunch of books at i use it everyday and at night too usually if my boyfriend is playing video games i do wish i upgraded to the back light one because you definitely cant see much when it starts to get dark outside other then that it is very convenient to have for those slow days at work,love itt
5.0,kindle it is famous for a simple reason is the real perfect solution for reading now the decision wich onethe question is what are you looking for in this case i bought the kindle 6 glarefree touchscreenwhat do i need a reading device that can give me hours of good quality pages and an endless book librarythis model has everything i need thenin terms of resolution is perfect now if you are looking for backlight well simple buy the next one in my case im aware that led light in dark environments can produce headaches so with this one im a totally satisfied costumerthanks kindlehope to be useful with this review,tell me who you are and ill tell you if this kindle is for you
3.0,okay its a good product but it wasnt right for me i was looking for a replacement for a kindle fire hd that had frozen up for the fourth time i was disappointed because it didnt have back lighting and i wanted to read in bed without having to turn on the overhead light my bedside lamp wasnt bright enough by itself i still want to have a back up even though my first kindle came back to life it seems to freeze up more and more often ive had it almost two years the paperwhite is light weight clear and easy to read if you dont care about the back lighting and you want a reader you can carry in a purse or pocket youll probably love it im thinking about the 119 model with built in light but i have to wait till i save up the extra money,good product but not right for me
5.0,i got this at a lower than normal price and it has exceeded my expectations it does what it is supposed to very well of course more expensive devices are sleeker and have more goodies color backlit and more functions but for the price this is exactly what i wanted to read if you read during day or with light on you dont need the back light but i could see that being valuable as an entry devicee reader i am very happy with it,excellent value for a avid reader with minimal investment
3.0,i decided to buy one when it was on sale so i could check it out its easier to read text with than on a similar sized nexus but it doesnt come close to be as easy to read as a real book the display size is too small maybe it will begin to be somewhat close to a book when they get the technology to make the entire front the screen there is too much wasted space around the edges in the current version,doesnt come close to replacing a real book
5.0,my fiance got this for me as a christmas gift and gave it to me entirely too early and i couldnt be happier i love the old style kindle because my eyes get too tired from backlit versions or from ipads and the like i like natural lighting and reading as if its a book i also love that i can take notes very easily and that i can scan through them quickly,and i couldnt be happier i love the old style kindle
4.0,debated with myself for years about getting a kindle have the app on my phone which i use daily having received an amazon gift card for christmas i decided to finally pull the trigger bought the basic model because im cheap hindsight being 2020 i should have gotten the paperwhite because of the light im giving my model a 5 star rating because it does everything as advertised,no regretsbut
4.0,it is very nice and easy to use the only problem is that i cant avoid accidentally bumping the screen and that always either changes the page or produces screens to change the type size give a definition of a word etc so my reading is frequently interupted to try to tap a clear spot on the screen rectify,it is very nice and easy to use
4.0,i purchased the new kindle for my mother this is an upgrade from her current kindle the 2nd generation white kindleweshe is still getting used to the new kindle however as of now i see issues with the wifi connection as the new kindle does not seem as responsive and loses the single mom may be set in her ways but she is trying the new touch screen vs the buttonsthe transition from old to new isnt that difficult in my opinion anyway mom and i are learning togetheryou can teach an old dog new tricks,i purchased the new kindle for my mother this 
5.0,this was a replacement for one i lost while the screen is the same size the overall size is smaller and more convenient one the other hand i occasionally enjoyed using the audio output of my previous model,i occasionally enjoyed using the audio output of my previous model
5.0,i even like the box it comes in i store my kindle in it and carry it around in my backpack like a actual book its convenient and protect my screen for reading i just open the box and turn it on awesome i really do love it,i even like the box it comes in
4.0,nice little reader that is good for sunny days a little flimsy in construction but it serves its purpose and is priced accordingly since i just wanted a reader not a tablet or notebook it is fine for what it is,nice little reader that is good for sunny days
5.0,ive resisted getting an ereader but the deal on this was too good to pass up add kindle unlimited to it and it cant be beat the only thing its missing is the back lighting that the paper white features but add a 10 clip on lamp and its still a bargain,but the deal on this was too good to pass up
5.0,i have debated getting a kindle for a long time but was never sure i wanted to give up on holding a real book and turning real pages well i finally decided to try the basic kindle and i am pleasantly surprised how much i enjoy reading on this i definitely read more now that i have the kindle its comfortable to hold there is zero eye strain and overall usability is excellent having so many cheap or free books available through kindle deals has already increased my kindle library substantially i bought a fintie folio case and they are a great fitscreen excellent clear no eye strain easy to readtouch excellent intuitive responsive turning pages happens subconsciously nowcasing good plastic but not uncomfortable maybe would have preferred a little matte finish for gripspeed responsive no lag page turns do not noticeably flash like the kindle keyboard i tried out from a friend which was distractingas a former kindle skeptic i would recommend this to anyone who isnt sure they want to give up on real paper i am very happy with my purchase,the kindle is very enjoyable
5.0,this kindle is fantastic i had another device for several years and loaned my device and over a 100 books to a peace corps volunteer the kindle is far superior i love the way i can change the text settings to larger or smaller depending on my eye fatiegue,this kindle is fantastic i had another device for several years and 
4.0,this is my fourth kindle bought it just because it was on sale and thought id get it to use just for reference books wish kindles came with reference guides as there is always something i dont know how to figure out finally found the users guide 2nd edition doesnt seem to go with the kindle i purchased but thats the guide i keep getting so must be the right one i want to know how to change the font as i like a larger print i found instructions in the users guide but cant seem to get the right text button on the tool bar this kindle may not have that capability have enjoyed all my other kindles and sure ill enjoy this one more once i figure everything figured out,i want to know how to change the font as i like a larger print
1.0,really ticked i swore id never buy another reader because they dont last long in my experience however i love to play every word and another game as a stress reliever you cant play games in this version really should make that clear in the description i couldve just kept using my iphone to read waste if money,i love to play every word and another game as a 
4.0,im used to a kindle fire hd so the display on this model is not nearly as easy to see  for instance its not easy to read book covers and i cant read with the lights off when my partner is sleeping but i bought this model to use for traveling because of the long battery life and its great for that also its tiny so it fits in my purse i look forward to using it at the beach since the kindle fire hd doesnt do well in bright sunlight this model is very cheap i got a discount because of my 2 year prime membership and is well worth the price for a backup special use kindle id give it five stars but i really dislike the pop up ads,good for traveling
5.0,i love this kindle it is lightweight so i can keep it in my purse and have it with me at all times i previously was using my ipad for reading my kindle app books this by far is better just like holding and reading the actually book im old schoolwhat can i say,great kindle
4.0,i like the extended battery life and the screen savers i didnt realize how much i would use it i have a kindle fire that i love but this one is smaller lighter and fits in my purse with ease the only thing i regret is that i didnt get one with the light,i like the extended battery life and the screen savers
5.0,i love how light it is after some of my heavy tablets its easy to read had it shipped while on vacation so i enjoyed it while on vacation when i had more time to read bought lots of books and cookbooks thanks for a nice reader i love the long battery life wish my other devices had a battery to last that long,i love how light it is after some of my heavy 
5.0,i had been considering getting a kindle product for some time but was unsure if i would use it and enjoy the alternative to traditional books first i debated between this version of the paperwhite i decided i didnt want to spend the extra for what is essentially a light and i have been very happy with this version it feels light but not fragile in hand and reads very well under normal lighting conditionsdownloads via wifi are speedy and browsing the kindle store is very straightforward the only downside is now im spending a ton of money on books its been a great resource to have and it really is a good deal i highly recommend it,excellent value for beginning ereaders
5.0,this is our third kindle in the house we all have one and love them theyre lightweight and so much better than lugging a stack of books around and as usual the online ordering experience was great thank you amazon,excellence is par for the course for amazon
4.0,i did expect the screen to be a little whiter more like the color of newspaper but i knew it wasnt the paper white so i am not too disappointedsensitive touch screen which is good but if you have pets and get hair on the screen be careful not to wipe at it with a finger because it will change your pagewas delivered very quickly,great
3.0,great value this is exactly what i expected it to be it works the eink or however its promoted is easy on the eyes and makes for a great change of pace from reading typical digital media in hindsight the back light may have been nice with the next version upgrade but i mainly purchased this to utilize the kindle owners library in congruence with my prime membership,great value very basic no extras
3.0,i like the glarefree kindle and the size is perfect but if you want to read in bed or in a dimly lit area there is no light or way to adjust the screen brightness i wish i had bought one with that allows you to adjust the brightness of the screen otherwise the battery life is excellent i have a kindle fire hd that i love but it has a glare when reading in certain places and the battery doesnt last any where near as long as the kindle 6,i like the glarefree kindle and the size is perfect but 
4.0,excellent kindle compared to first generation kindle paperwhite the screen is super sensitive it is really enjoyable to use this unfortunately i missed the light and decided to return iti have given only 4 stars because previous generation kindles are lighter and sleeker than this although this has better specs i feel there is no reason for this to be so heavy but it is not a brick just heavier than previous generationtotally a good buy but if you have used paperwhite before you will miss the light ,missed the light since i have used paperwhite before
1.0,hard to readsuper touchy not glare free a disapointment,super touchy not glare free
5.0,bought for my ten your old daughter whos a voracious reader 200300 page books in a couple of days if she likes them saving money now makes me very happy also picked up digital copy of science news the science news needs a bit of tweaking to make the digital copy easier to read but the kindle is a hit small light and convenient with great wifi connectivity at 5900 its almost disposable too the only problem i have experienced is its so compact my daughter can sneak it to bed and stays up reading till god only knows i am forced to do bed checks now for the kindle note my kindle came set in spanish fortunately i know some texmex so i was able to initially navigate through the menu options i did however finally call the help center for kindle and was promptly helped with the real spanish menu options to change the default language to english it was humorous too a middle asian helping a texmex speaking caucasian with proper spanish we both laughed several times together and at each other too,el kindle es muy bien pero mi espanol es muy mal
4.0,i like it ok i gave my old one to my sister i like the buttons on the side better to turn the pages this one doesnt have buttons on the side other than that though i like it finding the home button is a little hard too sometimes my finger are dry or something and i have a hard time getting the home button to work,good but miss buttons on side
4.0,this kindle has the same great glare free feature of the former kindles with touchscreen capabilities touchscreen works well no problems there overall i love it however unlike the older kindle versions there is no external power source for an easy to carry lighted case which means i have not been able to find a case i like as well as the designs that fit with the previous kindles i like to read before bed the lack of backlighting is great for preventing eye strain but zero visibility in the dark without at least a minimal light source any case has to have an external light for dark areas which gets a bit bulky to transportso overall 5 for the kindle subtract 1 for having to use an external and usually bulky light source in the dark still love it in spite of that though,touchscreen good wish it had better lighting option
3.0,i like my kindle but  as i have told a number of friends the home tab is sometime hard to reach because the words are so close to the top many times i get a word definition instead of going to home  another very annoying item is the game choices on my 3 kindle i enjoyed the game every word greatly it was a great escape anyway i have tried everything i can think of to get the game on this new kindle no results and the games that are there are either silly or just to troublesome to bother with when all i want is a pleasant interesting game since the reason i bought this kindle 4 was because my kindle 3 died i expected to be able to retain not just the books from 3 but the one and only game i enjoyed perhaps you can tell me how i might find this game or if you are able to send from 3 to 4 as you have the books ive read thank you,kindle games
5.0,perfect jobs i have been using kindle 4 with no touchscreen for 3 years and its time to change this device is a lot better than 4th version touchscreen make me easier read all my book especially when i want to go on dictionary or highlight any text love it,love this kindle
3.0,this is my second kindle much prefer the one w keyboard easier to find books etc it was a federal act just to figure out how to change the font size after initial setup was done it feels cheap and flimsyplastic the one good thing is that it was successful in downloading items from my other kindle pay a little extra and get the better modelmy advice,ok but feels cheap
3.0,when i bought my first kindle 7 years ago it was always a significant savings to purchase the kindle edition vs the paperback usually more than 6 cheaper to get the kindle version i practically made back the money in my kindle investment with my savings now im on my 3rd kindle and noticing that its cheaper to buy most of the books in paperback than it is to buy the kindle editions that is really frustrating i have a new kindle which btw is very touch sensitive and flips through pages if my kids touch it while im reading or if i try to wipe a piece of dust off etc and im annoyed at the price of the books sometimes the savings is 15 cents or its actually more expensive than buying the paperback lame i give it a 3 star because i still love the convenience of having a new book at my fingertips in seconds its a major space saver and amazon has pretty much wiped out all book stores so even if i could get to the bookstore it would take me 30 minutes to get there and i live in los angeles so once again amazon wins,or if i try to wipe a piece of dust off etc and im annoyed at the price of the books sometimes the savings 
5.0,im one of those people who has waaaaayyyyy too many books its getting ridiculous trying to store them all i have over 300 books so a kindle makes sense all future new books for me will be on the kindle either bought or borrowed from the local library i love my kindle i dont need for it to do anything fancy it does what i need it to do all i had to do was go to the library which offers free wifi and i was able to purchase and download a few books easily stores books keeps my place and i can download again from the cloud if something disappears light and easy to hold much easier than holding a big book and i read some 900 page books sometimes im also finding that ebooks may be cheaper than paper books saves trees too i havent had any problems i will have to charge it more often than it says because i read so much thats not a problem i got my kindle during cyber monday deals and got a great deal on iti am always leery of technology but this is very user friendly i would recommend this product,i love my kindle
5.0,i now have 4 kindles i love love love this one yes it is strictly for reading no games etc the big factor and most important is that it really is glare free i take it everywhere the beach the park etc i was doubtful and ready to send it back if i could not read outside i am keeping it you will love it and the price is perfect,i love love
5.0,this is my first kindle and im very glad i bought it it feels like its specifically designed to match my reading preferences its light and easy to handle the font options allow me to adjust the words to maximise my comfort and the dictionary lets me look up any word instantaneouslythe kindle store puts every book that ive ever wanted to read at my disposal and offers them in reasonable prices the daily deals are incredibly useful as well as the suggestions of books that i might be interested inthe access to goodreads is particularly useful to me since its one of my favourite places to discuss books and the twitter and facebook links let me share all the great books that i come acrossthe kindle has outperformed every other ereader that i have used in the past on almost every single levelanother bonus is having so many books on one device which is great for traveling without losing that magic that comes with good old fashioned books,a musthave for bookworms
4.0,i never thought of getting a kindle this one was a gift what i can say though is that i love it i had some doubts for the first few minutes what am i supposed to do with this it certainly cant do any of the many things a tablet can for example and thats precisely the point its a great reader and nothing else i take it everywhere with me its light and the screen is great and i dont get email or instant message notifications while i am reading so its very relaxing i give it four stars because 1 the touchscreen sensitivity is ok but not as good as it could be although this is more along the lines of a comparison with a tablet 2 it wont replace my books i cant imagine flipping between pages 100 and 350 for example to crossreference text because the interface is still too clumsy despite many go to options to me it doesnt beat a bunch of physical bookmarks you can place in a book,a very good reader to take with you everywhere
2.0,my kindle works great for the first eight months then my battery quit charging completely the only time i can use it is if its plugged into a wall as soon as i unplugged from the wall it loses its charge im very disappointed,battery did not hold a charge
5.0,i am very pleased with it i prefer to have audio books but havent heard one yet on it as i am reading another one right now do you take the kindle i had where the screen got broken or can you recommend where i can send it thanks,i am very pleased with it
4.0,it is a lot easier to use than my old model i would have liked to be able to download my books that were on my old kindle unto the new one since it was my first touch screen i have some learning to do i think that overall i will like it a lot more than the old one i am looking forward to doing a lot more reading on this one,i would have liked to be able to download my books that were 
5.0,this kindle has a glare free screen and no built in lightso it is easy on the eyes and a good break from viewing my bright laptop it downloads books in seconds and you can begin readingso very easy and convenient love this thing,should have bought one years ago
5.0,i loved it because i have a problem with my left eye and havent been able to read for several years but with the kindle i could adjust the print and the glare free screen was great i am returning it because since i found i can enjoy books again i am upgrading to one with a screen that has a light so i can enjoy reading in bed if i want to i already have read 2 books since christmas but am having to stop so i can ship the one i have back and await the new one that i have ordered which wont be available until 125it is really great to be able to enjoy reading again,i loved it because i have a problem with my left 
2.0,this was purchased as a replacement for my 3 yo kindlei have to admit i am very disappointed the charge seems to last about half as long the touch screen alternates between not responding at all and responding hysterically by pulling up random menu items or paging backward and forward at will setting up my library was very annoying and took about 3x as long as my last one to set up and for some reason i had to go back and download some of my items multiple times because they didnt stay in memoryit is very awkward to use unless i am sitting and holding it in my right hand its almost more trouble than its worth i would think i just got a lemon but i bought one for my son and my mom at the same time and neither of them like their new kindle either i wonder if its a ploy to get me to upgrade to a paperwhite or voyage,i miss my old kindle
4.0,i dont use all of the features im 65 but i love being able to take my books wherever i go the size is terrific and i love the glare free screenthis is my 2nd and best kindle simple and only for books i usually have 23 going at once,necessary for book lovers
3.0,not sure if my kindles battery is defective but my battery does not last as long as advertised it will not completely charge and the charge will only last maybe a day otherwise i love it i like having all my books in one place it looks great and very lightweight and easy to use,battery issue maybe
5.0,got it as a birthday earler giftwith a butwhen choosing a language got into the chiness though i speak english usa every time tried to change the setting it comes in away of cannot touch the setting to change languge ilove having it lightdream comes true reach to my hand wont work ,love it
4.0,it was a great purchase totally worth the value the only thing on design i think could be change is the possision of the botton just my opinion i think it will be more confortable on the top but other than that it was a great purchase would buy it again and again battery do last for weeks,it was a great purchase totally worth the value
5.0,i have been using my kindle for a few months now and love it it is the perfect size and weight i carry it with me all of the time it is great to have along when i find myself with some extra time or in a line i have been able to read so much more since i purchased the kindle i also like the ease of getting books from amazon or the library having goodreads right on the kindle is a plus as well great product i highly recommend it, using my kindle for a few months now and love it it is the perfect size and weight
4.0,bought this as a replacement for my old one that died would have been nice if i could have reused my old cover old cover had the light built in this has a separate light that i had to order just another thing i have to remember to take with me,would have been nice if i could have reused my old cover
5.0,l like it  i have a kindle fire which i lovebut my eyes water with the glare when i read for a while have not put the kindle reader down sice it came in today if i change my mind i will let you know easy set up easy to order books easy on the eyes happy with my christmas present to myself,merry christmas to me
4.0,while ive anticipated these things since the mid1960s i only bought my first one a couple of weeks ago my biggest complaint so far is there doesnt seem to be a table of contents thats always the first thing you come to in paperand its very helpful i am puzzled why it doesnt appear very first thing when you touch the title of an ebook the shopping cart had no listing for religious i typed in bibles and picked up a couple but there should be a listing for them maybe the geeks and literary critics who design these things dont have much to do with religion but here in the united states candidates for public office never bother attending an athiest convention and seldom bother with ones on philosophy or literaturebut they always make it a point to attend churches and make sure the cameras are rolling when they do they may not be terribly religious themselvesbut they know an awful lot of people are and they dare not neglect that group so neglecting them in your shopping cart is a bit of an oversightdont you think otherwise its okayexcept that for decades now pocket calculators have had solar cells so how is it the ebook reader neglects them there is one thing i would find laughable about the kindle if it were not so frustrating and that is the qwerty keyboard it displays one must huntandpeck all over the place to find the letters i suppose to an unthinking engineer a qwerty like that used on computers would seem reasonable but to anyone who understands how and why the qwerty came to be it is rediculous back when typewriters were first invented there were two basic philosophies on keyboards one was abcdefg while those familiar with the printing trade favored some form of etaoin srdluthe order of how frequently the latters were used the problem was that the slow movement of the mechanical connections used on manual typewriters allowed the keys to jam up the qwerty keyboard deliberately slowed down the typists fingers so that the keys did not jam up since the kindle does not use jamprone mechanicallylinked arms and since qwertytrained human fingers do not rest on the keyboard it would make much more sence for the kindle to use an abcdefg keyboard so that people will be able to find they keys they are looking for,kindle okaybut neglects the obvious
5.0,i have always appreciated the easy ability to change type size and access word definitions the additional ability to look up information on names and events etc is terrific i understand that it is easier to return to the text you are reading from a side trip to a footnote but havent used it yet it used to make me nots to accidentally go through a footnote wormhole i like to read at the gym while doing my cardio my first kindle was a great improvement over traditional books this version is even lighter and more useful,i have always appreciated the easy ability to change type size and access word definitions
5.0,love this new kindle still trying to figure some things out with it and the cloud feature would highly recommend this product if you mainly read and dont need all the other bells and whistles with the other higher priced kindles,love this new kindle
5.0,first off let me say that i love my new touch kindlei had the old kindle that had the keyboard at the bottom and this is a huge improvement in my opinion i love the fact that it is now touchscreen and that its at a low affordable cost glad i made this purchase,finally an upgrade
4.0,was really grateful that they decided to release this the old kindle tablet was great but its alread outlived its purpose and getting the new one just brought my reading experience to a whole new level ive got an issue with the responsiveness of the product but hey i still think that its worth the price,the old kindle tablet was great but its alread outlived its purpose and getting the 
4.0,i really liked this kindle the lay out is easy to navigate and fun to use though is glarefree it picks up a lot of light i was disappointed to find that this kindle cant surf the web like my old kindle the set in screen is not that big of a deal but dust does accumulate around the corners so i have to wipe down often other whys nice set up the touch screen is easy to use ive never had trouble with it id say a worth the money,pretty nice
4.0,as a new user of kindle products this basic edition will give me a chance to catch up with technology a bit its easy to navigate and user friendly with a screen that is very easy to read there are plenty of free books to downloadthis provides a nice way to learn all the features i am very pleased that i finally got a kindle,for the technologically challenged
5.0,i have had the 2nd gen kindle forever and love it but passed it on to my mom so she could take advantage of the wififree whisper sync since she doesnt have internet at home i love you this new one with the smaller size and touch screen,i have had the 2nd gen kindle forever and love it but passed it on to my mom 
5.0,bought it on sale for 59 when they had a national reading month promotion to replace my old 1st gen nook simple touch works great and i love it so far kindle unlimited is definitely a plus definitely recommend if youre looking for a basic ereader ,works great and i love it so far kindle unlimited is 
5.0,i was hesitant to try an ereader and i held out as long as i could the allure of carrying a lightweight library won me over and i am so happy it did although this is considered the basic kindle i think it offers everything i need i will still purchase paperbacks from time to time because i love books but this is an excellent supplement to any bookworms collection,shouldve bought it sooner
4.0,i love my kindle i have missed having one i use to have the kindle keyboard years ago i was hoping it would come back i could do so much with that my only problem with the touch screen is that if riding public transportation going over a bump can sometimes change the page youre on and i find it difficult to get back to the page i was reading at home or just relaxing its an a reading device i love my kindle thanks amazon,i love my kindle
5.0,great device i received this as a present and it is so easy to set up and use glarefree has met my expectations and i have read at a faster speed than usual as it always returns to my last lecture purchasing menus are well organized and i am always receiving great deals this results in an easier way to pick my next book,great device
2.0,it is hard for an older person to read with this kindle dont like that it is black and white i found it hard to figure the book titles i bought it to replace the old kindle fire but put it away and got the kindle fire back out will probably sell the kindle touch,dont like that it is black and white
5.0,this was a birthday present a complete surprise i love reading paper books so was not sure at all if i would like a kindle i have certainly been exposed to themi do enjoy my kindle very much i am trying the 999month free trial but do not think i will continue it after looking through the free book list there are not many authorstitles that interest mereading is easy on the screen and the size of the kindle is wonderful,my first kindle
4.0,i thought i was ordering a paperwhite but somehow the labeling was wrong and i ended up with this model it is much easier than my old one which i lost on some trip so far i have had no problems with it,my new kindle
5.0,bought as a gift to replace her old kindle she cant put it down loves the new touch screen and how much easier it has gotten to use it is much lighter than the other kindle and has a better grip also the screen is very easy to read and the fact that you can highlight and check online to see what a word means is great i would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a ereader,great ereader
1.0,the kindle 6 has begun to skip around to other books not ordered in the middle of trying to finish reading irrational exuberance by dr robert j shiller turning pages worked well for the first 70 pages and then it would suddenly change to other materials in the kindle but more often to books not in my kindle reader with ads relative to ordering those books from amazon i never got to finish the last third of dr shillers book because the kindle wouldnt stay with it it is not the batteryas the kindle shows i still have plenty of battery left although i did need to fully recharge the battery after the first 50 pages but that may have been due to not opening the kindle for several weeks while i was busy with other thingsi dont think i would ever order another book for this kindle,the kindle 6 has begun to skip around to other 
3.0,the touch screen is too touchy you have to hold the kindle along the tiny edges and if a finger even goes near the screen it changes it driving me crazy guess i will get used to it but till then ,too touchy
5.0,if you can actually read and are looking for something to read books with not play stupid freemium games and watch movies on look no further this thing is great thousands of free books and hundreds of thousands of books at low prices electronically delivered to you there isnt a back light on it so you cant read in the dark but the price is great, looking for something to read books with not play stupid freemium games and
4.0,i love it very much awesome device with excellent features i would give it 5 stars but i have one problem with it its not a big problem its just that theres no back light you havemail to read it with the light on you have to do the same with a normal novel anyway so its not a big deal,i love it very much
5.0,love this handy little kindle had the very first model and this one is the perfect size to drop in my purse also love that i dont have to turn on the wifi or tell it to sync with my other devicesfun addition to my electronics and the price was right,love this handy little kindle
5.0,amazon got it right here i have an original kindle it was nice to read with but the buttons were poorly laid out and confusing the screen size on this is tiny but the nextpage load time is super quick its quite natural to read with even with my aging eyes i can quickly adjust the screen and font settings to read comfortably in any amount of light,best kindle ive used
4.0,doesnt feel better in reading than my old kindle 3 ie kindle keyboard and whats with the ugly blocky design amazon i hate it could have been beautiful for the price the end user could have an option for audio jack even the 20 usd nokia has it the touch is not as responsive as it could feels very tired when highlighting textthe interface could be better and contract also for a kindle this price the resolution could have been better too the book title covers look so ugly on the kindle 3 they looked amazing amazon could easily subsidize the cost of special offers kindle even more i am sure they tap into a lot of profit via these ads this product is literally a handheld billboard with interactivitysaying all that its still better for readers who want focus then a shiny ipad,meh
5.0,i use an ipad on a regular basis but was looking for a nonglare device that would not disturb my sleep at night this kindle is an inexpensive device that is perfect for reading i love using it at night in addition the battery life is great,excellent device for nighttime use
5.0,between my daughter and myself we have purchased different kindles over the years i wanted something for myself that i could read out in the sun which this kindle does i am satisfied with it the ads are a little annoying but i was aware of them when i bought this kindle,i am satisfied with it
1.0,had to call for help to do everything on it it came with no instructions and it was not like my first kindleafter several phone calls and several hours on the phone i think i can manage it now not that you are asking for my advice i would like to suggest sending instructions with each new kindle your tech team is very patient and helpful they were very kind i spent about two hours with one on the phone now if your tech team has a hard time trying to get it to work just a imagine the average person working it i probably would give a higher rating had i had directions and could have made it work i gave all your tech team excellent ratings which they deserved,it came with no instructions and it was not like my first kindle
5.0,picture is great easy to access and use all the apps i have downloaded audio is also good netflix is great and easy to download movies all apps transferred from old kindle when i first turned it on,picture is great easy to access and use all the apps 
3.0,this kindle does everything it says it would however i didnt know how much i would need a backlight for reading at night this feature isnt available on this model also i thought there would be a feature that would give a character description when the character name was highlighted but this isnt possible either other than these two disappointments it is easy to read and accepts book downloads from amazon quickly using wifi for anything else is pretty slow battery life over 2 weeks is a plus,6 kindle pros and cons
3.0,i love eink thats what this is for its not a laptop but i was really surprised to get it and find its bigger than the one i bought for my boyfriend over three years ago about twice as thickdeep i guess touch screens need a bigger processor who cares the buttons were perfect for reading no bells or whistles needed you could turn pages with either hand and now you have to reach across to the right side and i keep hitting the wrong place or by mistake the old thin kindle fit so nicely in my purse ill see how it goes getting used to this but what a dumb improvement too late to return but when this one inevitably breaks ill get an older version on ebay,newer bigger
5.0,double outstanding im a book guy who decided to try a kindle greatest thing since sliced bread print is clear against the background very easy to read and easy to navigate the kindle battery charge lasts a long time no problem here recharging is easy just plug in ordering books is a snap i cannot commend this kindle highly enough for its wonderful technologyand its price the only advice i can give isget one youll be glad you did,greatest thing since sliced bread
3.0,i like it and have gotten used to how it navigates and like the fact there is no glare and it was easy to set up it initially connected to the internet but shortly after it will not i called my internet provider and it worked for a minute and then would not give me a secure connection to my wireless frustrated i will give it another shot at getting that corrected in a few days i do not find it all that easy to navigate finding a free kindle ebook or even searching for an ebook to buy but i am new at this so i will reserve my final opinion for later i have heard the same comments from other user friends as well all in all i am glad i bought one,i like it and have gotten used to how it navigates 
5.0,i solved a mystery todaya small one but it was entertaining i hadnt been thinking about it much having only noticed it a few times before but its one of those things that once you witness it actually happening in front of you you become more aware of just how many times the thing happened before without your really having taken much notice of it or moreover having any decent explanation of why it happened my new kindle i have left it outside beforewhether on a table or in the grass i dont know and that doesnt matteronly to return and find that i hadnt read this page or somehow the font size has changed or something else is different aliens no i had it in the grass laying there reading feynman of all things an ant crawled up on it they apparently appreciate feynman also and i watched in amazement as the thing stepped over letters on the screen the pages began to turn the things carry just enough electricity or whatever the mechanism that a touchscreen will register their movement as user actions in the spirit of feynman i proved that its reproducible while theyre more than willing to lose my page the moment i walk away it took a frustratingly long time to get a damn one of them onto a blade of grass so i could place him onto the screen,mystery solved why are my pages changing on their own
3.0,i like the idea of flipping thru the pages rather than clicking i like the dictionary on this model no keyboard on the bottom which was wasted space easier to operate and understand i only wish i could have gotten the better model with the light this was in my price range so i will settle and enjoy this kindle thanks amazon,easy to operate kindle
5.0,it works great so far i was worried about the touch screen being to easy to hit or that id have to use a lot of pressure but its just right only thing is its hard to find a case with a light attached,it works great so far
5.0,lighter easier to use and easier on the eyes than original which i had for years my wife cannot read print books without eye strain after an hour she can read this all day with no eye strain or irritation,relieves eye strain
4.0,a great value in ereaders i especially like the ability to see it clearly in sunny conditions something no other conventional tablet does the extensive battery life it also a feature that is wonderful you arent always trying to find a place to recharge havent used it much yet but look forward to some more reading,a great value in ereaders
3.0,i had to get a new kindle when my old one died i thought this would be a better version but i was disappointed when i could no longer get games on this model also since the page turner is on the screen instead of a separate button sometimes the page turns before i am ready,not as good as i thought
5.0,it is just what i wanted i had a kindle fire before but all i did with it is reading books the colors were beautiful but going to waste i gave my kindle fire to my grand daughter she is still speaking to me so i guess she liked it,the colors were beautiful but going to waste
5.0,i like my kindle its the fist one i have owned i did not know that i couldnt read it in the dark so good lighting is necessary for good reading other than that i really like my kindle,i like my kindle
5.0,i actually bought this as a gift for my mother many complain that because it is not backlit it is not a good purchase but my mom could not be happier she loves how it reads just like a page and that she can carry a wide array of novels in one small ereader,my mom could not be happier
3.0,bought it for my kid who complained because the pages didnt turn fast enough and it froze a few times so we decide to return it maybe it was a fluke and i got a bad one as it did have a blemish like a messed up pixal or something,okay
3.0,may like it in the end but so far its too jumpy suddenly changes the direction you need to swipe to shift pages and its hard to understand how to use it in all the many ways but im still hopeful,may like it in the end
5.0,i enjoyed the older edition until it had an electronic stroke and this forced me to purchase this new one at first i wanted to return it however the more i used it the better i like it now i carry it and used it daily i especially like it when i read out in sunlight hope this last as long as the old one also i was able to modify my cover for the older kindle which was longer to work perfectly with this new one,i enjoyed the older edition until it had an electronic stroke 
4.0,this version of the kindle performs quite well and provides a pleasurable reading experience although this version is not back lit i find that reading with this kindle that you will use many of the same methods in low light as you use with a traditional book the advantage here is ease of access and that you can be stocked up on several books without the need for using a lot of space this is very helpful if you travel the resolution of the book previews is low and there is a bit of a disadvantage of no back light however considering this is an entry model it is to be understood if purchased for children this is perfect,a solid entry level ereader
1.0,this was not explained well i wanted the same type of kindle that i had before this one is a new generation m odel but not listed as such so therefore it doesnt support the games i had on the old model but its not listed anywhere that it wont support the old games plus i tried chatting with amazon about it was on chat for over an hour shifted to three different agents who all contradicted themselves then i tried emailing amazon twice and never heard anything i was very disappointed with the service want to return the kindle but cant get through to a person to speak about it,does not support games that old kindle did
5.0,i have a tablet and really didnt think i needed a kindle because i had the kindle app my son bought the kindle for me for christmas i immediately noticed that it did not hurt my eyes to read loving my kindle,i have a tablet and really didnt think i needed 
3.0,my new kindle is not as user friendly as my olod one but i lost itthis one doesnt give me amt of pages left it is difficult to go to the dictionaryor manuver page turn sometimes takes several attemptswish i could find my other kindle,my new kindle is not as user friendly as my 
1.0,have been back to storetwice and still cant make it work i just wish they still made onethat older people could understand im going back to the store again wish i couldfind a used one like the first one i had,wish i could find a used one like the first one i had
5.0,i absolutely love my kindle within the first week of having it i read 3 books as someone who suffers from migraines i love that you can change the font size and style and that the screen has the same texture of a paper page the only complaint i have is that im so in love with i never do anything but read,love love love
5.0,this thing is gorgeous i really love it it doesnt give out radiation and battery life is amazing i hope amazon increases its durability though because it is very easy to get scratches on this kindle i suggest buying a case with this kindle but other than that it is awesome,awesome product
5.0,this was given to me as a birthday present and i i love it its light enough that i can carry it with me anywhere yet study enough that i dont feel like itll break at the slightest bump i also love the fact that it connects with my goodreads account, to me as a birthday present and i i love it its light enough that i can carry 
5.0,it is the best gift i bought for myself it’s very light i can manage with one hand and the interface is very simple and intuitive the hardware the user interface experience and seamless integration with amazon book store makes it top of the shelves,got more than expected
5.0,my only complaint is the reliance on wifi connections i dont have one and had to go to a local book store to get my kindle registered the difficulty in loading an ebook when you do not have access to a wifi connection is not great but it is kinda annoyingotherwise this is the best personal electronic gadget since the mp3 player my music player feature on my cell phone and my kindle are getting me through some long and unpleasant cancer treatments,great except for the wifi leash
4.0,a delight to read clear easy on the eyes convenient in size and flexible and accessible software problemsa its not clear how to highlight text that runs over to the next pageb why cant it come with a simple cover,well done some improvements suggested
5.0,i finally decided to move into the digital age of booksi am very pleased with the kindle only complaint i have at all is i wish i could change the screen savers lolvery very pleased,very pleased
5.0,i have kindle for ipad but i find it very difficult to read on the ipad outside i can read the kindle 6inch in the brightest sunlight with no difficulty at all the text is sharp and clear whether i choose to have it small or large the kindle is also very easy to hold in one hand it is easier to hold than a paperback or a hard cover book and causes less fatigue this kindle is a good deal at a very reasonable price,easy to read even in direct sunlight
4.0,this is my first kindle i immediately fell into love with it after i receive from the courier it really reads like a book except for some flickering when the page view changes i wish i could have spent another 40 more to get a kindle paperwhite i should not be deprived of using such a great product in dim light ,great product even better if i could get myself a kindle paperwhite
4.0,this version of the kindle is light easy to hold and easy to read the features are intuitive and easy to master although the device sometimes seems to get confused between going forward one page and going back one page tapping the right versus left side of the screen i wish it had the page turning visual of my previous kindle so i could be instantly aware when the page turned the wrong way other than that for less than 100 us i can carry hundreds of books with me every where i go at this price i dont really even worry about dropping the device or having it stolen when i take it to the beach or the pool as advertized the battery does hold a charge for a very long time i used it throughout 25 hours of flight and layover time and then read for almost a week before charging this is the paperback kindle everything you need and not catastrophic if lost or damaged,easy to hold and easy to read
5.0,didnt want a tablet this was perfect plus the price was right its just perfect i can read outside again yay its just bad to read at night before sleeping if you dont have a nightstand light,this was perfect
5.0,i have poor vision and love how i can increase the font size the lack of glare is also a big help it holds a charge a long time and is very light i definitely recommend this reader,i have poor vision and love how i can increase the font 
3.0,gets the job done screen refresh is nice and snappy which i love but the housing is very flexible and it feels very flimsy as a result i also dont appreciate the drm restrictions and the insistence that it be tied to an amazon account adverts for the sleep screen are also annoying purchased as a gift for a friend who claims to be clueless about tech and thus doesnt care about restrictions and she absolutely loves iti settled on a sony prst1 for myself it feels much sturdier and page refresh rate is almost as goodboth have noncapacitive touchscreens which was honestly my biggest selling point,screen refresh is nice and snappy which i love
5.0,i love my kindle i purposely got the one without any back lighting because i didnt want anything to interfere with my sleep cycle since they say blue light can have this effect im an avid reader and i love the fact that i can look up words immediately my two children are home schooled and we use lots of literaturebased curriculums i plan to get them their own kindle and buy the books online this is probably the best gift i ever bought for myself,i love my kindle
5.0,i resisted buying a kindle for a long time because i could read books on my phone or tablet i should have purchased one sooner this thing is extremely light but sturdy the eink display allows me to read for a lot longer without any noticeable eye strain or headaches which is something i cant say of my other devices its extremely convenient to be able to define any words you dont recognize by touching the word for a bit my only regret is that i didnt get a paperwhite the backlit display would definitely be useful in situations where i cant have a light behind me ive taken to using an old fashioned book light and that works fine for me at the price i purchased it at and even the current retail price a kindle is a steal for any bookworm,but sturdy the eink display allows me to read for 
3.0,the print is clear and easy to read this senior citizen needs a little more time to get used to it so far i am enjoying old books that i had never read and becoming reacquainted with childhood favorites,a new way to read
5.0,not what i expected and is a little difficult to figure out but once i did its great love the touch screen so i can turn the pages havent figured out how to archive my books on it i have some from my old kendall i want to transfer over but i do like my new kendall,its great love the touch screen so i can turn 
4.0,progress does not always mean improvement i could no longer get the original kindle i had with the buttons on the bottom this new improved version is not as intuitively easy to use i will get used to it but miss the ease of my old one and that pressing a button is definite whereas touching the screen is not,this new improved version is not as intuitively easy to use
5.0,my new kindle with ads works great it is the 7th generation kindle without a light that usually sells for 79 but i got it for only 29 during a special promotion i have used it for about two months very convenient size to take with me battery lasts a long time,great inexpensive kindle
5.0,i have to admit that i was highly opposed to buying a kindleold schoollove the satisfaction of flipping the pages of a hardcover book i never thought that i would get that same satisfaction from an electronic device i was totally wrong the first book i uploaded was the game of thrones book 1 yeah i knownow ancient i figured that the enormous paperback had been sitting around way too long i think it was the number of pages over 800 and the extremely fine print deterred me from picking it up time after time and although not the fanciest version of the kindle it suits me perfectly i have fallen in love with some of its basic features including enlarging font bookmarking pages online dictionary and the ability to flip back and forth between pages it not only feels like a real book it is so much more convenient i highly recommend,love the satisfaction of flipping the pages of a hardcover 
5.0,really like it although i have hardly learned how to use it it fits into my purse so handily that i can take it anytime that i want it is smaller than i realized it would be but 6 is 6 so i cannot complain in some ways i would prefer the larger one but this small one is handy and very readable,i like my new kindle
4.0,love these kindle for my addicted to books sons i bought 2 one bit the dust suddenly after 5 months of use it will no longer charge enough to stay onit just shows a blank white unresponsive screen we were so upset since we have no more room for books in our house and the item worked perfectly up until the moment it went blank in my hands while it said it was 34 full of charge i wish i could exchange it but no such luck at the moment,love these kindle for my addicted to books sons
5.0,of course this is a perfect kindle and you can use it for a clock and night light as well as a flashlight in the hostel when traveling i love my kindle and it was nice to share the love with my granddaughter,of course this is a perfect kindle and you can use it for a clock 
5.0,the kindle touch screen is a great readeri have a kindle fire but i needed something to read with when i am outsidethe kindle touch screen can be read outside with no glarei havent used it much yet but i think its a great reader especially for the price,the kindle touch screen is a great reader i have a kindle fire but i 
4.0,the web browser is scary to use always seeming to want to crash which it has but only once wish that it had access to netgalley as it does with goodreads otherwise its awesome no glare and surprisingly easy to read even with low light battery has lasted almost a week so far on one charge and daily use,otherwise its awesome no glare and surprisingly easy to read even 
5.0,im a kindle fan and this little device is always in my list of favorites i know there are some other models with more features and perhaps better but living in venezuela is yeah some kind of a nightmare so this one is great and more than enough the experience of the glarefree screen is really awesome responsive quick light and useful love my kindle ,great device
5.0,this has been one of the best gifts i have ever received books are so much cheaper and easy to read with this i read a few books a month and thought i would hate it since i love real books so much but i have found that i love it very much,this has been one of the best gifts i have ever received
5.0,i still enjoy reading books but i will say as someone who travels from california to chicago as often as i do it is very comforting to know that i have a large variety of books available to me at my finger tipsthe kindle is lighter than the majority of the books i read and doesnt take up too much space and space is quite a commodity if you are riding a flight with spirit or frontier trust me you will want that kindle with your ziplock bag of a carryonthe kindle is also excellent in the sense that it has its own light source how irritating is it when your seat mate turns on the overhead light and you cant have you 4 hour nap luckily the amount of light and lack of glare make the kindle low key comfortable and polite its guess its the kind of product you want your kids to grow up to be like simple efficient and full of knowledgeoverall id say its the best part of my flight i also like that this product looks and feels sturdy whereas when im using an ipad there is this thought that you potentially break the glassi love my kindle i cant wait to buy one for my boyfriend he reads off of his phone and i feel like i am going to change his life for the better,this kindle keeps me kind
5.0,love my kindle i mainly use it at night since i work on computers all day long it is nice to come home and read comics books books or magazines on the kindle with having to strain my eyes any more than i have too i also like the kindle unlimited i do wish they had comic books on the unlimited but it could be that i havent found them yet,love my kindle
5.0,this replaces my kindle3 keyboard edition that fritzed i really like the touchscreen and the ability to keep track of the words i look up i had originally purchased the kindle fire to replace the old kindle but found i usually played games on it instead of reading this new one encourages me to be less distracted really glad my wife gave this to me for christmas ,i really like the touchscreen
5.0,light weight i can hold it and flip pages in one hand nice for reading when the weather is cold easy on the eyes i like this better than the backlit models my daughter bought this for my b8rthday and told me she is getting me a case with a small light so i can read without any other light source,easy on the eyes
3.0,purchase was in response to your website showing various kindle readers purchased this as a gift have reviewed the web pages a couple of times and i cannot see where the advertisement told me there would be no color on this reader hence the disappointment for no color i offered to return this device for one in color recipient said this one is ok can live with it i however am disappointed,hence the disappointment for no color
4.0,functionality is spot on for a refurbished unit i upgraded from a gen 2 so the additional features are really impressive the two designations for storage cloud vs device is a welcomed addition and the store ribbon at the bottom of the screen is nice but could possibly be annoying for some the touchscreen locations for changing pages can sometimes make onehanded use a bit cumbersome but becomes easier with time all in all a very well organized reader with great functionality and usability making it the best dedicated reader on the market,gen 7 refurbished unit best dedicated reader on the market
5.0,im hoping this will save you some frustration and trouble when its time for you to synch up your new kindle with your home wifi serviceduring this process right after you select your applicable wifi provider from the list displayed on the kindles screen its going to ask you to type in the password from your wifi setup now i had made specific note of such a password at the time i installed my wifi service a few years ago and was glad to see that i had saved that information but when i typed the password into the kindle as prompted it rejected it eventually i figured out that what the kindle was looking for even though it used the word password was actually a tendigit number shown on a sticker right across the side of my wifi router unit designated on the sticker as network key rather than the password that i had written down when i typed the network key number into the kindle it was accepted instantly and all was well from there i hope this will save some of my fellow kindlereading friends some headscratching at the time of setup  beyond that the unit performs really well and im really enjoying it,a helpful tip regarding setup
5.0,perfect for traveling i got the good folks at my library to explain how to download their ebooks and its fabulouseasy to use easy to read easy to get new books way better than carrying the books i want to read in my suitcase why did i wait so long,perfect for traveling
5.0,ive always had 2 kindles a fire and a regular one my older one die and i was disappointed that the kind i had was no longer available so reluctantly i ordered this one glad to say i am extremely happy with it is lighter weight than my older one and easy to read at the beach,my older one die and i was disappointed that the kind i had was no longer available
5.0,the gadget is ok but the pages often jump to some sections when touching the screen a little faster the onoff power button sometimes is not working properly when i turn off the button it often still turns on so that it just instructs swipe to unlock kindle,the gadget is ok but the pages often jump 
1.0,even this replacement kept freezing up would not swipe spent hours with tech support even did factory reset will not buy another kindle for at least a year till they improve it i loved my original kindle with the keyboard page turns with just a touch of your thumb at the sides and no swiping,hate this kindle
5.0,its a kindle what kind of review do you need its really really great at one thing and thats why you get it super long battery life even with heavy use performs well in climates id consider extreme eg jungles during rainy season and high altitude mountains during winter just pair it up with pelican style case and you should be able to bring it everywhere the low glare screen is what makes it superior to a tablet for reading and thats probably the reason why youre considering getting one in the first place,really great at what it does
5.0,does all i expected of it and more touchscreen is nice password protection is great light to carry and good battery life the only minor drawback for me is a slow start and power off easier to navigate than previous version,touchscreen is nice password protection is great
2.0,yes it is glaire free little too sensitive changes font sizes but just a slight touch which i have to keep on changing im not sure i would buy it again but all in all its not a bad reader i bought it to read on the beach and seems to be fine like that im having trouble syncing it to my other devices,ok but needs improvement
4.0,love my kindle paperwhite it is exactly what i wanted something that i can use just for books i have my computer my smart phone i didnt need another one size fits all device just one to make my life as an avid book reader easierone thing i must note i got bad intel from the staples salesman who assured me that the screen did light something i wanted because i travel a lot at night in airplanes and also read in bed at night when i got it charged i realized there was no light a bit annoying but im living with it,love my kindle paperwhite
3.0,the device works fairly well and is easy on the eyes page turns have a bit of lag and navigation outside of reading has even more lag the lack of a built in light is a bummer the navigating the screens and menus are fairly easy and battery life is awesome bough it during national reading week at good discount so it was worth what i paid for it full price would be a bit of stretch,good but not great
5.0,my christmas present from my husband i love it reading more now that i have all my books with me all the time i almost got the one with the light and am glad that i did not it would have defeated the purpose of not staring at a glowing rectangle this is perfect and my eyes feel like i am reading paper great purchase,the best way to read
5.0,there was a bit of confusion about the kids bundle protection plan but once that was figured out it went smoothly when you get the email about your promo code start with the protection plan listed on the amazon site not at the squaretrade website that is where the confusion came the email i received made it sound like everything needed to be done with squaretrade i actually added the 2 year protection plan to my cart on amazon and used the promo code there instead worked fine you just have to do each protection plan separately if you have purchased more than one kindle the kids are each going to love their kindle excited for the birthdays to roll around in a few months,advice on activating the kids bundle protection plan
1.0,this model is definitely a retrograde step by amazon there are no intuitive buttons and everything is so much more complicated why do companies have to try to improve and make a product worse the early versions of kindle were so much better,terrible kindle
5.0,great for learning spanish i really appreciate the ability to quickly translate a word on the fly and store the words automatically for future reviewin the past this feature was not well implemented for some books it was not even possible to select an appropriate dictionary an englishtospanish dictionary is not much use for reading grandes esperanzas however there has been a lot of improvement and it is really useful nowfor the first time i prefer kindle books to physical books,improved features for language learners
5.0,i received mine as a christmas present and its great i was dubious at first whether i would enjoy using an ereader or not but it has thoroughly won me over in just the first several weeks i use it for pleasure reading and also convert work documents to kindle format and save both my eyes from lcdinduced stress and trees from being turned into printer paper i would like to see a little more customization possibilities on the system level especially regarding power saving features wifi sleep options etc but im sure these will come in future generations and everything essential is already included the battery lasts me about 2 weeks with about 152 hours of reading per day i read fairly fast and i suspect all these extra page turns per hour are responsible for the slightly shorter battery life than others report the free dictionaries which are included are a huge added bonus and many classic outofcopyright books can be downloaded for free from either amazon directly or from third party collections such as project gutenberg works well with linux im using the calibre ebook manager would highly recommend to others,won me over
5.0,i love being able to carry my entire library around in my purse i also have a nook i bought the kindle because amazon and bn often have deals that the other does not i had the app on my phone and ipad but i do not like reading on a back lit screen for long period especially since i spend my workday on a computer this kindle is well worth the price,i love being able to carry my entire library around in 
4.0,works great however i liked the style and size of my previous generation kindle touch better previous version is thinner this model is a bit thicker and clunker looking also the plastic on this model looks cheaper the onoff button on my previous model quit working so i needed to replace otherwise this works great and gets the job done,meets expectations but liked the previous model better
5.0,this is easy to use even for an older person who is not totally computer knowledgeable i did not think i would like it as i love books so much however it is so light and easy to use that i find myself enjoying it,this is easy to use even for an older person who is 
4.0,my wife really likes it for reading her books personally i would have liked to see a couple more capabilities built in like sound and extra memory not all of us fully believe in the cloud as an answer for storage,i would have liked to see a couple more capabilities built in like 
5.0,i have had this certified refurbished kindle for about 2 weeks i used it on the beach in the bahamas and the screen was easy to read i also have a kindle app on my ipad at nights i read on the ipad and during the day i read on the kindle the two of them kept in sync nicely  i also bought the elsse case for 929 and it works fine httpwwwamazoncomgpproductb00o4s6poypsc1redirecttruerefohauidetailpageo00s00,easy to read on beach
1.0,the one and only reason i bought this reader was to read pdfs yes it has a pdf reader huge disappointment and actually misleading by saying it works with pdfs you cant increase the font size to make the pdf readable its like taking a pdf article shrinking it down by 60 and printing it and i missed the return window so now im stuck with it,kindles do not work with pdfs
5.0,sturdy yet lightweight construction ideal gift for seniors or handicapped individuals that find holding books to be difficult great hybrid for those less tech savvy makes borrowing books from your local library a breeze,the perfect present
5.0,completely met my expectations i wasnt looking for a topofthe line tablet just a cheap ereader to see how often id use one obviously it feels a little cheap because its pretty much made of plastic but putting it in a cover makes it seem nicer i actually like that it doesnt have a backlight because i read a lot before bed and its easier to fall asleep when you arent staring into the light for a long period i got the special offers one which is annoying just because the principle of the thing but honestly it doesnt really bother me that much maybe because there isnt color or sound i think its a good buy if you read the description know what to expectim also very pleased with amazons customer service i ordered this for the 79 price and a couple days after it was delivered it was on sale for 59 i called them to see if i could have the difference refunded instead of returning and purchasing a new one and the service representative credited 20 back to me with absolutely no hassle simple things like that go a long way,read the product description
5.0,honestly i was skeptical i thought it would be my next cup holder like my ipad 3 but this has turned into my most adored and appreciated gadget all reviews and videos describe this perfectly great screen and easy to read made for reading,great screen and easy to read
5.0,the kindle was exactly as described and what i expectedalthough it doesnt have a backlight this was stated in the description therefore i was not expecting that feature to be thereas an older person i am not too savvy about electronic things but i was able to charge the kindle follow the instructions on the screen and download booksmy kindle was slated for delivery in february the date was moved to decemberi am very pleased with my kindle and amazonthank you,i am very pleased with my kindle and amazon
5.0,this is light and easy to fit in my purse i can take it with me to read in the waiting room at the doctor or waiting in line at the post office or any other time i get a minute i love that i dont have to charge it often and its easy to use great little reader,this is light and easy to fit in my purse
4.0,as an ereader there was not anything wrong with this device i had had a kindle fire first and never was quite happy because i could do much more with the kindle fire so when it was reduced and i was able to return and order that i did it held a charge much longer then the fire i had had did,great for books
4.0,just missing my page turner feature i have on my iphone kindle app other than that its great already downloaded a great amazon book and an ebook from the librarycant wait to curl up and read, other than that its great already downloaded a great amazon book and an 
5.0,my eyes get tired really fast because of the display lights and this kindle was perfect for me i feel like i am reading on a paper this is my first kindle and i totally recommend it it is easy to use it and the touch screen is good be aware that this kindle has no builtin light so you cant read it on the dark, fast because of display lights and this kindle was perfect for me
4.0,this seems to be a good reader but i liked my classic with the buttons better i broke the screen on the classic so no going back i would suggest not just tossing it in the car and then kneeling on it while packing for a trip  the 7th generation is really light and that is actually a negative for me but probably a positive for most the case for the classic plugged into my kindle and had a builtin light that worked extremely well im still trying to find a good reading light for the new 7th gen one i am beginning to get used to the touchscreen but i really liked the tactile page buttons and home button on the classic still love the nonbacklit screen,would like built in light but good for reading
5.0,i dont know why i didnt buy one of these sooner the ads are very unobtrusive but i love this kindle already between its light weight and glarefree screen i can read for much longer than i can on my tablet or my phone which im thrilled with,but i love this kindle already
5.0,i got tired of reading on the kindle app for android so i decided to purchase the basic kindle when it went on sale i love that you can select your font type and size reading seems a lot easier when you dont have to read small print reading is also easier when there isnt a backlight shining in your eyes battery life is good as a light reader this is perfect for me,perfect for me
2.0,i am probably the only person in america who got my kindle with no back light it was given to me as a gift and i had to return it i read in bed and travel a lot internationally so reading in the dark wasnt possible my friend ordered one for herself and one for me and hers had the paperwhite but mine didnt hopefully once they get the return she can repurchase it i loved the kindle after years of going back and forth because i love to hold a book so i was so disappointed i had to return it but amazon was so great about it…so i am looking foreword to really enjoying it in the future,i loved the kindle

4.0,kindle was great except the language set on it when i received it was spanish had a little trouble setting it up as i dont read spanish to read the instructions a call to tech support set it all straight and it works fine,oops i speak english
4.0,love it easy to read battery lasts a long time when on airplane modeonly thing i dislike is i paid for my lockscreen to be without ads and every time i lock it the picture changes i would like to choose one wallpaper and keep it not having random pictures as my lockscreen its a tad annoying but im super pickyand i wished it had a screen brightness option i know the paperwhite doesbut its so much more expensive sucks but if you only read in the day where there is light youll enjoy it otherwise its great can carry it everywhere,great two things though
4.0,it seemed easy enough to get started however i can not figure out how to get ordered books on both kindles that we own i can not figure out how to transfer a book from one kindle to the other kindle is that possiblesince both kindles are on the same account how do i know that a book my wife orders will go to her kindle and not mine,it seemed easy enough to get started
5.0,as an apple fan i was nervous purchasing a kindle i read a lot of reviews about a lot of ereaders and was debating between this and the barnes and noble glowlight and tested a lot out at different stores the glowlight is constructed horribly looking childish you can also easily remove the grey rubber band that goes around the device that is supposed to protect itonce i received my kindle there was no debate this perfect little piece of technology is wonderful i got the 79 version with special offers and honestly i like it better than not having them every time i sleep the kindle i get new book recommendations suggestions for kindle covers etc and the barely 12 inch advertisement bar at the bottom of the screen is no bother to me and continues to offer suggestions of books which is pretty neat i also chose the basic kindle because i already have a laptop and a smartphone i got this simply for reading having all those notifications for facebook email and so on would just be distracting and not necessary it honestly helps me stay focused on my book and lets me really submerse myself in the storyits so easy to read off the screen and the eink technology is great no glare light weight solid plastic construction that fits great in your hand and a simply clean design with millions of books at my fingertips its my booklovers dream and im very happy i bought it,the glowlight is constructed horribly looking childish

2.0,disappointed that the lighting is a bad as it it i bought it because i got a cheap promo but i would recommend the paperwhite over the basic model,disappointed that the lighting is a bad as it it
5.0,its the perfect size very light its easy to use and the touchscreen response is much faster than my previous kindle touch my old one would freeze up or lag terribly but this one doesnt at all the only issue ive had with it is that sometimes i will accidentally move it or brush something that unintentionally changes the font size its easy enough to correct by touching to top of the screen selecting font size then going about my business but the accidental changes indicate that there is some sort of font short cut that im unaware of but keep triggering on accident no big dealanyway i love my kindle it does exactly what i want it to do without any frivolities i wasnt looking for yet another tablet or a device that could do things my iphone and ipad can already do i just wanted something that could mimic the book experience i still love good ole fashioned books but the ease and convenience of this device makes it perfect for travel or extreme inbedallsunday laziness if i finish a book i can buy its sequel and have it downloaded to my device in seconds its like magic,easy and uptodate without unnecessary featuresits perfect

4.0,its a very great product as mentioned in the products description it doesnt have a backlight but a purchasing a separate clip light will do the trick have had no problems using it for the most part except when utilizing the dictionary function where when you tap and hold a word it shows you the meaning of that word sometimes it would give you a separate word instead of the one intended in one instance i think the word i tapped was mended but i received the definition for the noun mende,great
5.0,i have had a kindle for some time and have been very happy with it i just got a new one for christmas my only small problem with the old kindle was the lack of a backlit screen in bright light the old kindle screen is easier to see than the type of screen on a laptop or a tablet but in the dark you needed a reading light the new paperwhite solves this problem with a screen that is as visible in sunlight as the old one and has a variable backlight meaning i can read in bed without putting on my bedside lampa few points about kindles in general first they are better for books that you read through from beginning to end than for books that you leaf forwards and back in like reference books second the browser is pretty useless for anything other than shopping for kindle books if you want to browse the internet get a tablet if you want to read books get a kindle,like the old one only better
4.0,i do like this product i wish i purchased the paper white with the back light it is my own fault but overall i like this kindle its my first one,great buy

4.0,great product with a lot of user flexibilityjust one complaint no backlight the one detriment to being able to read is the lack of light so i would think that this would have been a primary consideration,great but no light
4.0,printed instructions need to be included with the kindle to assist the purchaser in getting things set up since the instructions are only in the kindle itself they are not accessible to the firsttime user of the product instructions are no good if they are not where someone can see them beforehand someone goofed in not having the instructions where they are easily accessible when the product is removed from its shipping container otherwise things seem satisfactory,instructions are no good if they are not where someone can see them 
3.0,i just replaced my older kindle version 3 wkeyboard and here are the proscons from that perspectiveprosthe touch screen is intuitive and makes navigating much easierthe contrast appears to be sharper and the image quality is betterits smaller but not too smallnot too bright so it doesnt hurt your eyes always good with the basic kindle modelsconsit doesnt feel as well made it has flimsier material that feels cheap and easily breakable i understand that lighter is better but not if it results in a shorter product lifeslightly thickernot likely to last as long with all the screen touching especially if it is einkit is too small for a generation 3 cover to be expected but now i have to make some alterations to my leather caseif you are looking for something simple that you dont care about kicking around this works i am a little bummed at this new kindle its not as solid as the older ones but its not awfulalso i went from no ads to ads because i thought i wouldnt mind and well i do thats my own fault though if anyone out there is thinking about going with the special offers and has been without it know this besides the screensaver the ads are a bottom banner even on your home page,eh
5.0,this was a replacement for my older generation kindle i love this one as much as the version i had previously easy to use and easy on the eyes while reading during the day not easy to find a lighted cover to fit it for night reading however,great readability
4.0,like the screen a bit too much tech stuff for this senior to absorb ie page numbers timing how fast you read etc a bit much for this senior readerstill not sure how i get the book to the cloud when i am finished with it disappointed that when i asked to remove the promotional items i had to pay over 20 for that to happen as an octogenarian im pretty much aware of what i like to read so reading suggestions are not appreciated and certainly not needed yet i had to pay to have them disappear bad policythe cord could have been a bit longer when charging the book the help i received from gavin and a woman i spoke to the day before i spoke to gavin were helpful and very patient with this seniors concerns,like the screen
5.0,i couldnt see my ipad to read outdoors this little thing works like a charm it holds its charge for a really long time you can buy books on it and look up words in the dictionary its lightweight and easy to hold i love it,so great by the pool
4.0,great size just so confusing as there are so many with so many accessories i ordered a case and it didnt fit ordered another style and it fitalso when i got the kindle fire i have my regular kindle away had i known i could not read on the fire i wouldnt have given it awaythis new kindle i got is perfect for reading outside especially on the beach,what i wanted
2.0,for some reason the power button on this device randomly quits working especially after sitting for a day or twoother than that its nice,iffy construction
3.0,its fine i bought this because i had to replace my 2nd generation kindle the one with the full keyboard which i loved i dont like this kindle for a few reasons i dont think this kindle holds a charge as long also i accidentally hit the screen and skip a few pages forward the menu is also super sensitive and pops up when you dont need it i wish they still made the original with the keyboard and hard buttons to turn pages but this one is good enough,its ok
3.0,sent it back to change it for the paper white didny realize it didnt have a back lightbought the paper white with the built in back light,need a clip on light to read
5.0,i was reluctant to get a kindle since i have an iphone six plus but it was on sale and i was going to be traveling for hours i bought a nice light but sturdy case for it and downloaded a bunch of books from my library and its great because it looks like a regular page you need light to read it as its not backlit so the eyestrain isnt there,i finally did it and i like it
5.0,i like the lighter weight of my new kindle when i used my older kindle i used to touch the page turnbutton by mistake i dont do that any more,i like the lighter weight of my new kindle

1.0,did not get a chance to evaluate it because you cant see it in the dark there is no indication that there is no way to control brightness or that it is not useable in the dark i guess i assumed too much from an ereader,did not get a chance to evaluate it because you 
5.0,this is my first real kindle previously i was using a first gen kindle fire i recieved this as a christmas present and have been using it a lot since receiving it i have noticed a significant reduction in eye strain and the reading experience so far has been great it is like reading newspaper print my version has the advertisements and i have to say they dont bother me at all which is something i was worried about they are nonexistent when reading i havent experienced any cons it is a great lightweight little kindle and i like that it doesnt have back lights it makes the experience much closer to reading print,great little device ads dont detract from experience
3.0,guess i didnt read the blurb well enough and was disappointed there was no built in light but then my grandsons cant read it in the dark so it was okay, i didnt read the blurb well enough and was disappointed there was no built in light but then my 
4.0,touch screen responsiveness is not 100 but its good for what its designed for reading ebooks battery life is good tooonly real complaint is that zooming does not work to well so larger bookssuch as textbooks might need to be split up and read horizontally,touch screen responsiveness is not 100 but its good for what its designed for

3.0,the pages in this do not have a light so to read at night you need a book light i also bought a cover for it because it is small and i kept touching the screen which brought up menu pages while i was holding it,spend the money and upgrade from this version
4.0,great to read outside which is what i wanted has taken two one hour sessions with amazon trying to get it registered and be compatible with my kindle fire,great to read outside which is what i wanted
5.0,fantastic way to read i dont like using a tablet as reader because of the lcd screen and backlight that cause eyestrain and effects sleep but the kindle makes easy and friendly to read a book in bed or at any time,fantastic way to read
1.0,cant use it only bringsup reviews by chapter you charged me 999 for book dont i get 30 days free can i talk to someone i am so disappointed mel,i am so disappointed
4.0,ive been wanting a kindle or an ereader for a while so when the price went down to 64 i finally got one ive bought a lot of ebooks on amazon before and all the books synced nicely with this one this reader is very basic and at first i was looking for a button to make the screen lit up then realized this version does not have that function its nice and light and its been working well so far it is touch screen and the screen can be quite sensitive and i find the fonts increase or decrease in size with the slightest touch which can be a bit annoying overall im happy with the reader for basic reading needs books only,good value
4.0,as i am still learning how to use my kindle i will not give it a 5 star until i know more about the device but other than that i really like this device ,i will not give it a 5 star until i know more about the device but other than that i really like this device

2.0,smaller than my old kindle and the lending library comes with a monthly price tag better to use your public library online lending service which is free,dont waste your money
1.0,the old kindle touch was much better if only it didnt die after only 2 years i was told that everything on my old kindle would be saved and could be downloaded but my favorite game everyword crossings was not and now isnt even at the kindle store also the old touch had 3g and this one only has wifi and it cant be turned off ugh,not as good as the old one
3.0,the screen is not as white as it appears on the amazon site the contrast is not as good and that makes it harder to read in less than fairly bright light,a little disappointed
2.0,i find it more complicated to use than my earlier kindle which died i probably should have purchased a kindle reader instead when all i want to do is use my kindle for reading novels in addition my books on the new kindle are scrambled and i had them all in collections on my old one the thought of redoing my collections is overwhelming for menot a good purchase for me,not a good purchase for me
1.0,i should have done more research on the differences in kindles i made a quick purchase and realized after the fact the fire is the way to go disappointed,spend a little more to get a lot more
5.0,my wife got me this for a surprise gift and i just love it i had used her older version and problems with the buttons on the sides always getting pressed inadvertently and losing my place but since this one has the touchscreen its not a problem my wife also made me a custom alpaca wool cover for it too which makes it even better thanks honey,first kindle for me and i love it

2.0,disappointed with the ads that pop up would not purchase this again due to the ads loved my old kindle fire but the charge connection broke and i cant use it,ads ruin this kindle
5.0,i never write reviews but im so happy with my kindle that it definitely deserves onei resisted buying a kindle for years partly because i prefer reading books the oldfashioned way and partly because i just enjoy collecting books especially attractive hardcover editions or out of printantique books recently i got a kindle as a birthday present for my boyfriend he loved it and i saw firsthand why since getting one for myself i too have been loving it its perfectly suited for light reading or reading in bed i love that i can get all those novels guilty reads and general history books i dont necessary want to burden my bookshelves with at a lower price i save room and apparently i also gobble them up at half the speed and wrist pain when reading in a reclined positionso if youre an avid reader andor you love the real thing but would rather stop hoarding paperbacks you end up selling at garage sales a year later while saving up for beautiful editions of things you want to hold on to for life invest in a kindle couldnt recommend it more,love my new kindle
4.0,very good reading,four stars
1.0,what i am frustrated is the warranty setup i have spent several hours to activate the warranty with many calls to squaretrade they have no understanding of how it work and online registration for warranty should not that difficult if amazon giving coupond why it should not automatically ask squaretrade setup the warranty why sending an email with additional discount code to me and make me go through this headache totally unhappy with amazon on this,what i am frustrated is the warranty setup i 
4.0,very nice kindle,four stars
5.0,ive had a secondgeneration kindle for years and enjoyed it but the touch screen makes for a much smoother reading experience i find myself more willing to switch between books and search within a book because the navigation is easier and the rate at which the pages load is quicker i bought the version with ads and the ads arent distracting at all im actually glad i didnt spend the extra money for no ads i use a case so i dont really see whats on the screen when im not reading anyway,touch screen makes a big difference
5.0,great ereader my second generation lasted me nearly five years before it finally gave out this new kindle is even better than the last well worth the money,great ereader my second generation lasted me nearly five 
5.0,worth itthis was 100 worth purchasing and i have no regrets about my choice of model the ads are really not a big deal at all and it saved me a lot of money to go with this version ive already recommended this to a couple of friends as ive been very happy with this purchase,ive already recommended this to a couple of friends

4.0,im pleased with my kindle but quite disappointed with the editing of the books ive read so far there are missing words incomplete words wrong tense etc,im pleased with my kindle but quite disappointed with the editing 
4.0,i am enjoying the kindle very much i understand there are kindles and fires with much many more apps but just for reading this is all i needthe kindle has nice sharp black lettering on a white background this makes for a good contrast and easy reading my eyes are not what they used to be so it irritates me when there is very little contrast between the lettering and the background,beats the choice of grayed out lettering on your websight and emails
3.0,needs to be brighter in the dark should have a light sensor and brighten the white background when in dim light also should have the manual already loaded,needs to be brighter in the dark should have 
5.0,i bought this after my first kindle stopped holding a charge and it seems to be working great i like the features it comes with like the book information and average read time this item is enjoyable to use as long as this one does not have the problem that my first had it will be a great item,i like it

5.0,i had a book size kindle previously and was hesitant of getting a smaller kindle because the larger kindle was cumbersome when traveling i purchased the 6 touchscreen it was easy to set up all of books were carried over immediately reading is now more enjoyable and comfortable this kindle for the price is a bargain,it was easy to set up
5.0,i love it cause it is only 49 bucks and i can carry lots of books in hereabout the effect of the reading i will post it after using a period of time,i love it cause it is only 49 bucks and 
5.0,this is my second kindle purchase as first look you can hardly tell the difference between this version and my older one the size and weight are similar enough the big difference comes in the touch screen being an ipad user the touchscreen is now more natural to use than the original buttons to turn pages its a great product to have in your bag especially if you travel and need an ultra lightweight device the kindle is great for trips instead of my ipad especially for reading outside,its a great product to have in your bag
3.0,i like the extended battery life however in order to engage the page marker it takes two steps and to disengage it takes three steps not necessary when the original took only one step each i also do not like the fact that there is no back lite cant read in bed at night,cool reception
4.0,when i ordered this i was really excited when i received it i realized i didnt read all the details and missed the part that said there is no back lighting however i bought on clip on light for 160 and it has worked well my granddaughter borrowed the kindle and is having a wonderful time reading all kinds of books i have amazon prime and she can get all kinds of books for free a great buy on my part and i love it,great but needs light
4.0,i love my new 6 kindle it is light weight and i can hold it in one hand it is easy to use and it allows me to do most anything i can do on my tablet,i love my new 6 kindle
4.0,very light so easy to carry in my purse so i always have reading material available downloads are easy and fastthe anti glare makes it a bit darker inside tham i like butonce i read the manual ill probably find theres a setting to adjust it,happy with my purchase
1.0,having a hard time figuring it out no instructions called about my problems but tech support couldnot help is it possible to tradthis for an old kindle,having a hard time figuring it out no instructions 
3.0,when i got this i didnt realise at the time it had no back lighting so that being said i bought it to be able to read late at night while my boyfriend is trying to sleepbut cant because i cant see what i am reading otherwise its ok for daytime or full lighted room use and convenient i do plan to upgrade to the back lit version as soon as i can afford to,when i got this i didnt realise at the time 
5.0,this is my first ereader i was wary of getting one since i didnt think it could possibly be as good as reading from real books but its great love this thing,love it
5.0,i absolutely love my new kindle i had a kindle keyboard until it broke and was finally able to get myself a new glarefree kindle i prefer this one over the keyboard its easy to use and you can either swipe or just touch the side to turn the page its very light and compact so easy to take along with me in my purse wherever i go very happy with my new purchase,5 stars for this kindle
2.0,disappointed it did not have a back light great gadget for reading in sunlightbeach need to turn a light on for indoors a liitle more often than for a book,sad to say
5.0,i have bought this kindlebut i return it several days beforethe package is shipping on the waybutim so sorry that i return the wrong package there is two watches in it can you ship it to my address again,return wrong packageplease ship the package to my address againthank you
4.0,it is not what i expected i prefer my older one but then i will keep an open mind till i getto see if i get all the books i had ordered that were on my old one,it is not what i expected
1.0,received this as a gift the very dark gray screen combined with the black text and no screen light adjustment is really a disappointment cant figure out who likes this dark stuff you wouldnt buy a book or magazine like this maybe mine was defective maybe on a beach in super bright glaring sunlight it has a benefit not so at home trying to read in the dead of winter in the middle of the day i just do not understand this product cannot return it except for an amazon gift card do your homework before naively opening the box save your and read stuff on your iphone instead,the very dark gray screen combined with the black text and no screen light adjustment is really a disappointment cant figure o
2.0,came with no instructions i can not figure out how to work it would have been nice to have instructions my sisterinlaw is in the same boat not instructions,would have been nice to have instructions
5.0,this kindle is great i bought it as a gift for my eight year old daughter she enjoyed using my older kindle but i thought i would need to explain the touch screen after having it in her hands for less than a minute she told me this one is so much cooler than yours she has had no problems using it and loves it,this kindle is great i bought it as a gift for my 
3.0,i bought the gen 6 to replace an older kindle that had started having problems i love how easy it is to turn a page the longer battery life was a big selling point for me i only have 3 stars because of the lack of audio component i love to listen to my books when im on the go and for the blind i know that was a great feature i dont need it lighter nor do i want to spend a small fortune on a kindle fire to get what should be a standard feature i would have given the gen 6 five stars if they had not removed it,it could have been 5 stars
3.0,the screen is grey and too dark and the brightness is not adjustable i wish i had known this before ordering i would order a paper white instead of a glare free,too dark bothers my eyes in a long read
2.0,this is my third kindle and very clearly the worst quality the other two got cracked screens despite being in amazoncreated cases which is a whole different storythey got rid of the forwardback buttons on the side which i really liked everything is touchscreen now which means that when i go to turn the page i keep accidentally changing font size or highlighting something im a pretty tech savvy millennial but i cant get past this annoyingly sensitive screen i should have found one of the older versions on another site kindle is definitely going downhill when this one inevitably breaks its time to find another ereader,third and worst kindle time for something new
1.0,i bought it on nov 27 2015 to give as a gift for my sister in law she started using it in january and by the 2nd week of february the screen already stopped working at first it was intermittent stop and go then it just completely stopped working no wonder the warranty is only up to january 31st i guess they knew it would stop working after only a few weeks,broken in just over a month screen stopped working
2.0,i returned it soon after receiving it no page options as well as very little font options not what i expected returned and purchased the kindle fire 7 screen and was less expensive than the kindle 6,i returned it soon after receiving it no page 
4.0,overall the kindle platform is excellent for reading both articles and books the eink display is adequate for reading in daylight however if you plan to read in the dark it is hopeless due to no backlight on the subsidized version with ads it can e somewhat annoying due to a very small variety of ads and thus repetitiveness i enjoyed the integration with goodreads compared to competitors like the nook the kindle has a huge advantage in terms of selection and also price i recommend this device to anyone who loves reading and wants a device that can store all their books in one place,overall the kindle platform is excellent for reading both articles and books
3.0,i thought it had a white light to read in the night also the kindle was registered to someone and their credit card was on the tablet strange for a new product,i thought it had a white light to read in 
2.0,910th of the way reading a book and the reader freezes attempted to rest the readereverything i may have it working again dont know if it was the bookor the reader frooze on page 312 i have deleted the book maybe i will check it oout from he library so i can finishe reading it lol,frozen
3.0,this kindle needs to have a light in order to read anything the screen is not glare free regardless of how you advertise it but all in all it is a fine ereader,but all in all it is a fine ereader
2.0,6 eink with page buttons on the side seems to have died in approximately a year worked well satisfied until then it raises 2 questions 1 why buy the same brandcompany that had such a short life 2 is this what can be expected w the more costly units if so it makes me rethink if a dedicated ereader is for me at all as opposed to a tablet or other option seeing the new units are toughscreen only does not encourage buying another,died in infancy
3.0,nice little e reader i shouldve paid more attention to item details and description though no light and limited internet access which is a task in itself to use,good 1st e reader not high level however
5.0,i received a kindle for my birthday at first i was a bit skeptical but its turned out to be one of the best presents ive received in a long time its so easy to carry everywhere and takes the monotony out of daily train travelthis is my first kindle and im not familiar with the features of others but the glarefree screen really does make it seem as though you are reading a real book and the touchscreen display makes it really easy to turn the page when your hands are occupiedthe stepbystep setup procedures take the stress away for the technologicallychallenged like myself and before i knew it i was all setup with my first book purchase highly recommend it,i was a bit skeptical but its turned out to be one of the best presents ive received in a long time
5.0,this refurbished kindle is great now if i could just get amazon to recognize it as my fourth kindle and send my solitaire game to that device i would be thrilled,this refurbished kindle is great now if i could just get amazon to 
3.0,cheaper quality than i expected it feels like a mix between a late 90s computer and a etchasketch as the image of the previous page often lingers when you change pages mostly on the store rather than books but its light i can download free ebooks from the library and i dont get distracted from reading by opening other tabs so it works plus i managed to get a pixelated dot on the screen that wont go away within a day so i doubt theyd take it back overall id probably do more shopping around next time as it didnt feel worth the price but it works and was nice to not lug books traveling,fine not great
1.0,the screen skips quite often and esp when changing pages also very hard to read unless there is a lot of lightwish i bought the paper white instead,the screen skips quite often and esp when changing pages 
4.0,i love having a way to take my current book with me without carrying it everywhere im not experienced enough to use it by myself but am almost there the library has been my source since i am technologically impaired i havent been able to shift it to the chapter im on since im reading from the hard copy at home there may be a way im a hands on person so i avoid printed directions thats strange considering that i am never without a book since ive been in the second grade i am 68 so u can see the reason that it is an adjustment for me to have something other than a book itself in my hands i really wanted the kindle for trips,i love having a way to take my current book with 
1.0,very disappointed no audio feature no whisper net no control over ad content put on my kindle when it is asleep as far as i know i would return it if i could,very disappointed
5.0,i bought two one for my husband and the other one for me both of us are very very happy with them they are small and can fit easily in my purse and can be taken everywhere and i really love how you just touch the page and it turns what a great kindle and im very happy with what i bought,very happy with them
2.0,i bought that for my daughter first but i did not like it the screen looks pretty dark i sent it back and got a paperwhite instead it is worth the extra money,but i did not like it the screen looks pretty dark
5.0,im one of the people that a color lcd screen on a tablet will bother me if i read on it for very long ive used a 3rd generation kindle keyboard before but there is no good way to describe difference in the ease of use and responsiveness of this kindle compared to it it seems as fast a tablet without the eye strain the controls are well laid out and very intuitive to learn and use the virtual key board is far better than the old physical keyboard and last it is small and lighter and will fit in a coat pocket i love it,homerun
2.0,i have to have a nonblue screen reader to read before bed so when my original kindle broke i bought the more expensive kindle i thought it would be most like my first kindle but it was not i do not like the touch screen set up i cant go back when reading newspaper articles to the previous article not to the previous page and my hand often hits something its not supposed to and then the thing jumps around and its harder to shop for new books so i returned the expensive kindle and got this one and the experience is almost identical might as well pay less money,i thought it would be most like my first kindle
3.0,though the screen is clear you cant brighten the screen therefore on a dark airplane it is tough to see the screen other than that is is very solid and rugged construction the touch screen features are also nice with the dictionary option to flip between books and the ability to remember your place if the brightness was better i would have given it a five star review,not as bright as i had hoped
4.0,got the kindle free after rebate when bought a laptop from staples battery has good charge and i like the amount of free or cheap books on amazon got grisham book on sale at thanksgiving but is was a disappointment but the kindle is not,free
3.0,when i pur phase this product i thought it was colored and not black and whiteoutside of that i have never been disappointed in anything i have purchased from amazon,not happy
5.0,i have owned the original kindle key board and purchased the kindle fire 7 inch as an upgrade however i just wanted a dedicated reader that didnt have a keyboard which was time consuming so when the new kindle touch 6 inch 4g came out i had to jump on it you can read in direct sunlight and the screen remains glare free no eye strain the pages turn effortlessly and you can adjust the font as you read so no need for readers its small and compact fits easily in your purse or in a wide jacket pocket holds hundred of books and can download a book in seconds it does not light up which isnt a problem because you can purchase a light to attach when needed or purchase a case with a built in light with the new kindles you will get the advertisements as your screen saver the older kindles had a few portrait options for a screen saver the battery life is exceptional you can read for hours everyday without charging it does not come with a wall charger the previous model had the wall charger included the kindle library is extensive with hundreds if not thousands of free books to chose from kindle touch has a special feature were more then one person can use the reader for example when one person sign in it will show that person there personal library and vice versa for other readers i paid 5999 on sale during the holidays i would have paid the regular price of 7999 because it is well worth it and this kindle will not let you down,whats not to love about the kindle touch
4.0,cons no back light may be a deal breaker for people who read regularly most of the times it is fine but sometime i feel having a backlight will be good to have feature,good overall cons no backlight
5.0,i never thought i wanted an ereader but was given this as a chrstmas gift i was suprised how much i enjoyed reading on it the glarefree screen was easy to read with no eye strain like i feel when being on a computer screen an extended period of time it is light weight and easy to hold while reading no fighting to hold some pages open like while reading may have liked a light so i could read in bed without disturbing my husband but would not give up the glarefree screen for a back light,i was suprised how much i enjoyed reading on it
5.0,love love love it,five stars
5.0,had the old kindle and this pretty much made an improvement since its faster smoother and easier to operate typing in this couldnt be easier and would totally recommend to people who would want to upgrade their old kindles or someone who wants to buy it for the first time,great improvement over the previous versions
2.0,it freezes and takes awhile to load books i also have to shut it off if i didnt want to read the book i accidently clicked on because there are no options to go back,not that great
2.0,i dont really like this kindle am used to the one with keyboard had a hard time finding books i have ordered and cant figure out how to archive the ones i have read very disappointed in this device,i dont really like this kindle am used to the one with 
5.0,the only issue is you can only read the books from amazon knoobs and nobes i think is the name of the bookshop for example allows a wider range of supported formats,the only issue is you can only read the books 
5.0,i just got mine today and i love it ♥️ i love reading and this was just the perfect ereader for me its very light and small i can take it anywhere its easy and simple i totally recommend this ereader 👍,📚♥️📖👌
5.0,its so great i just dont know what to do with myselfcurls up in bed is stormy out begins to read so it was is many more times since,i think i should
5.0,i loved and still love my old kindle and wanted one as close to it as i could find this fits the bill perfectly i use mine strictly as if it were a book i love that there is no glare and i can read it on the beach or on the boat no pages to blow the font is adjustable for my husband with low vision so he can read again too what a joy,i loved and still love my old kindle and wanted one 
2.0,with a built in wifi i thought i could download the booksi have wired connection so couldnt use it without traveling 20 miles to download everything i returned it,with a built in wifi i thought i could download 
5.0,great little kindle i have a fire a paperwhite my absolute favorite and this one i keep in my purse i love it its small and lightweight no backlight but its perfect for what i am using it for,great little kindle
5.0,i love it and it is my constant companion when its not inappropriate,five stars
5.0,i really love this kindle i love reading and this makes it more convenient for me with my busy schedule its easy to hold and i like that it doesnt have a light my eyes have gradually worsened from overusing my phone so the break from the backlight is appreciated its just like a normal book and you can read that in the dark i can only recommend that you order a case with this i have two cats and even though i kept it in the box when i wasnt using it i noticed that cat hair was accumulating along the edges of the screen i would buy this again if i had the need,perfect
1.0,i received a kindle as a gift two years ago for a year and a half it was fine then i started having problems with it for example i would receive messages stating that i am no longer connected to the internet which caused problems with not being able to read my emails or go on facebook i am still experiencing these problems and i am just fed up with my kindle i would not advise anyone to purchase a kindlerather i would advise against a purchase of any kindle,very disappointed
1.0,no text to speech even no speaker or earphone jacksbought some books technical ones in kindle format and later found out it doesnt work for kindle touch or kindle paperwhite what,doesnt meet my expectation
1.0,as i often use the device during the rush hour in public transportation i can¨t use the device as i wish its too difficult to operate the kindle with just one hand everytime i turn page i have to be afraid that the kindle falls down,useless during rush hour
3.0,it is crisp and clear but sometimes when you are trying to read it keeps going back to the start window very aggravating it is not back lit so you cant read in the dark,not the greatesti would buy the paperwhite instead
4.0,overall it is very nice and extremely light weight but trying to bring up the menu tool bar to access settings isnt not too easy since you have to press and hold the very top edge of the device and wait for it open gets frustrating when it thinks you are highlighting a word or phrase they should have given it a dedicated home button that would take you to the menu bar or the home screen if you have big hands it is almost impossible to open up the menu bar to access settings,overall it is very nice and extremely light weight
3.0,it works great in daylight and if you have a lamp next to you if reading at night but cant see to read in the car at night havent found a way to turn up the brightness,it works great in daylight and if you have a lamp next 
4.0,so far so good easy to activate easy on the eyes for reading i wanted something inexpensive for travel so if i lose it i wont have to cry a long battery life will be good too still testing that,basic unit does what i need
2.0,totally mediocre absurd that the brightness could not be adjusted i rather thoroughly dislike and must exchange reading books on my ipad iphone and nook is far superior,lousy
4.0,a fantastic device not perfect but for the price it really doesnt need to be it does everything you need it to if you want to read minus a light to read at night the response is great the load times are fast and you would be happy if you are considering it,a fantastic device not perfect but for the price it 
5.0,special offer price was too good to pass by wasnt in the market for one but decided add a newer kindle to my collection glad i did was delivered in 2 days all is good,special offer price was too good to pass by
3.0,thanks to all the informative reviewers who go into such great detail and really help folks to make informed decisions about buying a new kindle i have a question for folks who have one of the newer kindles either the plain 6 inch touchscreen displaythe 79 model or the newest paperwhite one of the things i loved about my plain old kindle the older one without keyboard with built in light was the ability to read without being online in airplane mode so no annoying pop up features and such interrupting my reading i know amazon proudly touts all the fabulous things the latest and greatest kindles do with wifi but unless im downloading a book wanting to look up a word etc i really dont want to be online can anyone tell me if the newest plain kindle and the paperwhite both or either have ability to turn off wifi for reading a book that has been downloaded thanks for any info,question about wifi
2.0,the screen is smaller than i expected having trouble navigating through pages not as user friendly as id hoped hopefully summer outdoor reading will be beneficial,the screen is smaller than i expected having trouble 
5.0,the minimalistic design and accessibility make this ereader a fantastic investment it does not however have the features of a dedicated tablet it was not made for that particular purpose and is solely focused on providing the customer with the ability to read books,the minimalistic design and accessibility make this ereader a fantastic investment it does not
3.0,i liked my old kindle better in order to shop the kindle store you have to be connected to wifi on my old kindle i could buy books anywhere it also feels cheaply made,amazon could have done better
5.0,i like that it is simple to use i like the glare free screen it is lightwight smaller than my last kindle easier to carry around love the cloud feature i also bought the booklight and that is really nice and compact along with it,i like that it is simple to use
5.0,this is my second kindleit is smaller than the old one and has touch screenbattery life and all other fitures are the same at a smaller bodyworking great,good as the old kindle at a samller body and touch screen great
5.0,does everything i expected it to do i have an old and failing model with keyboard and button page turn the battery is now on its last life and has to be recharged frequently i prefer the tap screen and the increased battery life no more wondering whether it will last long enough to get me through my own or my husbands medical appointments i like the nonglare screen and the fact that i can read with ease in direct sunlight i never read without a light on in the room so this basic model is perfect for me,basic and perfect
4.0,this was a replacement for first generation and i miss my old features like music voice reading and whispernet not all places have wifi its ok very small and light,ok ereader
5.0,i purchased this at the urging of my sisterinlaw who is much more tech savvy that i am we are going on a lengthy vacation later this year and i did not want to have to lug around a huge bag of books on our trip this device was on sale but i delayed purchasing it and when i went to order it was back to its original price of 7900 i still think it was a good deal for me because i have already read 2 books and ive been able to carry it in my purse when i want to take a book with me to an appointment it is lightweight and relatively compact an english teacher at heart i do prefer a real book but the ease of the kindle is great in certain circumstances,a great purchase
4.0,doesnt read certain kindle titles such as the new xkcd book so i returned it its a pretty good value for your money but you should probably get the new fire instead,not bad but get the new one instead
5.0,fabulous love the eink the eink has always been my preference for my kindle since i live in florida and do a lot of reading on the beach very pleased with my purchase i love kindles so convenient to have several books on one small device,great product
4.0,overall i really like my kindle it is the first handheld electronic gadget i have ever purchased i am still getting used to how it works but so far so good i hadnt thought about it being black and white only so the book covers look pretty bland and the childrens picture books dont look so great on it but i have read a few short books on it and like it overall,works great
3.0,i feel like there are pros and cons with this devicei love the idea of an ereader and when i purchased this ereader my thought was to use it with amazon prime which we had just purchased i thought that if i bought the reader with prime that you have access to billions of booksuntruewhat the websites dont make blatantly clear is that most of the books you want to read arent available in prime and you only get to check out one book per month that makes a big difference now if you want to get a subscription to kindle you can have access to more books but you are gonna spend 999 per month to still not be able to read all the books you wantas far as the reader goesi do like it it is easy on the eyes and very simple nothing fancy no headphones but dont buy the reader with specials with specials means that there are annoying ads on your lock screenso i figured out a way to not pay for books and check them from the library its round about and not simplebut its freeand i am cheap i hope amazon doesnt take that away i am keeping the ereader its so light weight in hand that it is enjoyable to use,hope this helps
5.0,love love love love my kindle this is my first kindle that i have own so i dont have any previous ones to compare it to but even if i did i would still love it i am very excited to have my books store in this device which saves me space on my shelves also i got more excited when i found out that you could get book loans from your public library and have the books downloaded right in to the device how awesome is that what an increideble invention,love it
1.0,it wont download freezesmay be defectivehavent been able to pursue tech helpalso it s near impossible to read graphic books on itwhich are among my sons favorite books,one star
5.0,i liked this reader so much that when i misplaced my existing 6 touchscreen kindle i immediately bought another of course i found the missing one so i will be able to enjoy reading that much more our family has only two sets of eyes but three touchscreen kindles now,one wasnt enough

5.0,its awesome instead of spending heavy amounts on hardcover books i can now buy e books for very low pricesome books are free onlinei bought it for my grand daughter i recommend it for all who like to read,good choice
5.0,love it no backlight but i dont like feeling like im reading a computer screen since i stare at one all day this feels like im reading a book just smaller and very light,love it no backlight but i dont like feeling 
5.0,light and compact enough to go into any midsized handbag its perfect if all you need is books to read without the hassle of their weights just remember that if you dont entirely shut it down it does slowly drain the battery but since all the functions it has is that of a ereader the battery does last very longif you need more functions like that of a tablet then id recommend to skip this and the fire and go straight for a tabletipad instead,thousands of books without the weight and bulk
3.0,it shows in the instructions where you can change the background to lighten or darken but it is not on my kindle its very hard for med to read with such a dark background,not what i had hoped for
5.0,did not expect to like it as much as i do but the reduction in eyestrain is pretty amazing just getting acquainted with the world of kindleformatted books is introducing me to some fun new authors ive resisted ebooks but am definitely enjoying them now,did not expect to like it as much as i do but the 
2.0,we bought this on a promotion and i knew that its features were limited but it wasnt worth the money we spent it definitely needs the backlight dont bother with this one,not worth the lower price tag
4.0,this is an amazing value imo but i bought it for one purpose to use it with my dji drone as a video monitor kindle is an amazon product so it doesnt come set up to use google apps i knew this and had planned to try hacking google play on to it since amazon sells dji drones and amazon fire tablets it only seemed right it worked after much brain strain and trying to download things that the fire said i couldnt download because my device wasnt configured to download this kind of stuff i am very happy with it and may even try a game or two but i dont think so buy it you cant go wrong,this is an amazing value imo
5.0,i love my new kindle i am enthusiastic with reading which something i wanted to develop as a hobby for a long time and so far i am very satisfied and happy with the kindle,i love my new kindle
4.0,the background seems a bit dull compared to normal books otherwise it is very good at doing what it says that is being a book reader i have already loaded my books and have started reading on it,the background seems a bit dull compared to normal books
3.0,purchased during xmas for 13yo sturdy and does what it should lack of back light should make you think twice though wifi works ok not fast clear picture and easy to use,need a reader with a back light pass on this one
5.0,picked this gem up as a christmas gift for my father my mom and i finally swung him around to the digital side of literature hell never totally give up on physical books but he now realizes how much additional reading material he was missing out on thank you for continuing to make this user friendly version of your popular reader you saved both his sanity and mine my father enjoys his kindle and uses it everyday,my father loves it

5.0,this is my third kindle and while its taken me a bit of getting used to i love it so easy to get word definitions and the touch screen makes turning pages so much easier,third kindle
4.0,the kindle screen is much much easier on the eyes due to its paper like feel i use this for both pleasure and school and i love how i can gave all of my books in one place, much easier on the eyes due to its paper like feel i use this for both pleasure and 
3.0,i like my 1st kindle better where it listed all my books plus those archived i also liked the screen size as i get older and need the print larger over all i love my kindles,i like my 1st
3.0,liked my older version of kindle better as it had a button to change pages newer kindle has touch screen to change pages which doesnt work very well when using a waterproof bag,liked my older version of kindle better as it had 
5.0,i have an older kindle ereader but this one is great i love the touchscreen and it holds a charge longer and has more storage it is so clear in sunlight or regular light i was lucky to get it for 20 off and it is so worth it,an amazing book
3.0,can anyone post a link to a covercase for this kindle with a builtin light i bought one and was willing to pay 50 for it but the kindle is slightly too large for it thanks,need cover advice
5.0,i love my kindle its still small so its like reading a book its great to have storage for books i am waiting to read the only thing i dont like is that i still have to use my book light at night not a bad thing but i wish i could have afforded one with a light,reads like a book
4.0,the only bad thing is it doesnt have a back light other than that i love it very simple i dont need a bunch of apps to download if i wanted that i wouldve gotten a tablet,no back light 😕
5.0,i received this kindle for christmas was not expecting what i received this kindle is amazing cannot get over how it can show so many books and you can read samples of whatever book you are deciding to read the flashcards are great for increasing your vocabulary the battery life is long and the kindle is so portable you can take it with you wherever you go and you have reading material available there is so much more to learn to do with this little gadget what a fabulous gift to give to anyone i had no idea how nice this thing is love it,what a surprise this kindle is
5.0,love it very light,five stars
4.0,love the unit but the programming still doesnt provide a way to keep the books in collections from being listed on the main screen since i have over 590 books current it makes it time consuming to find the book i want to read without going through many steps to find the one i want i appreciated the old system where i could store collections as i chose and have a smaller list to contend with,love the unit
1.0,think it its really bad that amazon hasnt got any new kindle besides the fire that had text to speech that is the one reason i purchased this kindle and then had to return it,ridiculous
5.0,this kindle functions great and is perfect for travelling its light and you can borrow lots of books off your local library and load them on the device not to mention buy books on amazon the screen is not back lit so your eyes dont get tired from staring at a screen it is very much like a book i have to say i love books and wouldnt trade them for anything but this kindle is a close second when it comes to reading paraphernalia,this kindle functions great and is perfect for travelling
1.0,halfway through initial setup the thing froze up on me and i was unable to get a hard reboot to fix it sent it back and got the new paperwhite this may have been by design ,frozen within minutes returned
4.0,it arrived very fast and was partly charged it was easy to set up and came with a kindle guide book installed while it is not as fancy as my fire it does what my husband needs in a reader because the text can be enlarged he has enjoyed reading again this will be a wonderful item to take on our vacation it is not lit from inside and at night he needs a light we knew this when we bought it and it is fine this item met our expectations,for a reader this does the job
5.0,easy to use the screen is fantastic  doesnt have a glare very light and nice to read in bedwe travel a lot and i can carry 100 books without worrying about the wight,user friendly
5.0,love it it fits nicely in my bag it is user friendly very little to no glare please note there is no way to adjust brightness you will need a book light or lamp in poorly lit rooms i am extremely happy with my purchase,perfect for outdoor reading
4.0,good product but be aware that it doesnt have a light so reading at night is not possible it looks like the same item that does have a light so read the description carefully,light easy to use in daylight but no night reading
5.0,cleanlooking easy interface no more need to attach to a computer a lot of good books available without additional cost because of my prime membership and a beautiful screen everything i want an ereader to be nothing i dont,easy interface no more need to attach to a 
3.0,disappointed that my cover from my previous paperwhite doesnt fit this one doesnt feel like its made the same hate that i am buying another after only 2 and a half years,like this and dont all at the same time
2.0,my 5th original kindle died the only glarefree option offered to me at a discount as a very loyal kindle user was this second rate copy who ever thought that an interface that involves rubbing ones oilladen fingers across your reading screen was a good idea i know tablets and touchscreen smartphones are the most popular around that still does not make them a good idea touchfree is available for wii and other devices also it would really be nice to have a way to synchronize my replacement device to get all the contents and subscriptions from the dead device with ease rather that one at a timei will be looking for alternatives,loyal kindle user severely disappointed
4.0,this is the second kindle product i have owned purchased it primarily to use as a reader because of the ability to use it in brighter light so far it seems to be a good choice even though it is not as easy to use as the other kindle i own hopefully in time i will understand it better the help provided by amazon has been great so i think it will get easier as i learn more about it i really like the light weight of the unit makes it more like holding a paperback book than the largerheavier kindle i own plus it is easier to take with me when i am going somewhere where i might want to use it ive only had it for a couple of weeks so i dont know how it will be long term but right now i am very pleased with my purchase,so far it seems to be a good choice even though it is not as easy to 
5.0,love reading from this helps with eye fatigue since it does not have a backlit background i have not had any issues with bookmarking highlighting or turning pages i only wish that it had page numbers at the bottom instead of pct read so that i would know if turning the page whether or not i have skipped a page,its basic but i love it
3.0,disappointed in amazon help more than with my new kindle 7th gen 6 glarefree touchscreen display amazon used to have superior service sadly no moremy issue is that gamesactive content that i had bought for my old kindle 2nd gen dont work on my new kindle when i specifically asked that question before i purchased the new kindle i loved my old kindle but the paging has gone haywire so i contacted chat and asked them to make a recommendation i only had 2 requirements love the screen on my old kindle so wanted the same screen nothing lighter or that lights up and want to be able to play the games brain trainer scrabble ea solitaire etc the guy immediately recommended this kindle i pointed out to him that on my old kindle i had a physical keyboard with a control button which is used to play the games but didnt appear to be on this new kindle he put me on hold to check and came back confirming i would be able to play the games great but wrong multiple emails chat sessions and phone calls and frustrating days later i finally got the truth my gamesactive content wont work on this new kindlenow they did reimburse the cost of my games but as i pointed out to them to no avail were bought when on sale or for free and for me to buy new versions of games that will work on my 7th gen kindle i wont be able to for the amount they were refunding methis whole thing could have been avoided if amazons personnel was properly trained knowledgeable on their productsi could almost understand one individual making a mistake but unfortunately for me i ended up emailing calling and chatting with multiple individuals who couldnt or wouldnt directly answer my questions  which makes me a very unhappy customernow my actual experience with this new kindle is just okay the touch function needs some fine tuning paging doesnt work as expected all the time could be operator error this is going to be a challenge because the tablet is small im going to have to train myself not to accidentally have a finger or part of my hand on the screen when holding it because that does impact the touch functioni love the smart lookup dictionary and vocabulary builder brilliant ideas for word nerds like me i need to experiment more with word wise and xray might enjoy them toopage numbers are nice but i initially was confused by them because i thought a page was skipped page numbers relate back to the paper books physical page so the kindles font size can impact whether you display more or less than a physical pagei havent found the voice read aloud function on this kindle and maybe it doesnt have it  which would be disappointing because i did enjoy that on my 2nd gen kindlein some books ive never read before sections are highlighted i havent figured out why  but its not going to stop me from enjoying reading on my kindle ,amazon customer service is now horrible most gamesactive content dont work on this kindle
3.0,i liked that it seems like paper doesnt hurt my sight when i need to understand a word its easy for me to check it out the only disadvantage is that there is no arabic books,i liked that it seems like paper doesnt hurt my sight
5.0,thought i would never enjoy using a kindle for reading but this is great fits easily in my purse so i always have something to read i am on a fixed income so i especially love being able to download books from the library why did i wait so long to get this,love it
4.0,i have only had my kindle for a short period of time but i really like it the swipe to turn the page function is a little more awkward than a button but overall i love my kindle,kindle is exactly what i hoped it would be
3.0,it gets glare you cant adjust the brightness if you can its very hard to find lots of books are 10 but otherwise its great and i love it much easier on your eyes and very convenient i love the pictures it shows when you turn it off and it has great battery,its mainly great but a few minor annoyances
1.0,i dont like it at allglarefree in my definition and the company who made it must be from two different dictionaries it is not very user friendly and i wish id not bought it,i dont like it at all

3.0,it is what i expected for the most part i did however expect to access my nook library from my kindle that was a disappointment that i cant have all of my books in one place,nice to a point
4.0,love this already i am using it for passing the time while commuting to work its small light easy to use either you cant adjust the screen brightness or im dumb and cant figure out how but i have to have lights on when reading to see the screen,why didnt i get one sooner

1.0,was very disappointed with kindle reader had no light that is the main reason i ordered it my eyes are not the greatest was hoping this would help would not reccomend to anyone,was very disappointed with kindle reader had no light
4.0,i really like it i researched it and knew what to expect as far as features the offers are really unobtrusive i think next time i will upgrade to one with a built in light with the whispersync i just read on my cell phone in the dark and use my kindle for daytime reading it does feel fragile and with two young children in the house i feel like i have to hide it the official amazon cover would be nice but seems expensive in comparison to the price of the actual device,i really like it i researched it and knew what to 
3.0,the hardware is fine the price for books is full retail i can buy the same books at target with 15 discount for an actual book i think an ebook should be less than a real book,the hardware is fine the price for books is full retail
5.0,i had one of these that was stolen point here if it happens to you and you want to stop who ever swiped it from using same just go to the your account section and pull up lost or stolen and zip it is taken care of now for this kindle as i said i had one and liked it very much so we ordered this new one it is basically the same as the old one except there has been a major change in loading new books and deleting them i like the idea of showing the book cover rather than the shopping list of old the fact you can go right in and delete book without the hassle the old model had is for me a great plus being a senior citizen the lighted screen is sure a plus for these old eyes really like,great kindle
2.0,this is the 4th kindle i have owned and the only one i dislike beware there is no ability to adjust the brightness of the display rendering it useless in lowlight situations,and the only one i dislike beware
4.0,this is a great kindle i wanted an ereader that i could read just like a book and not have it give me a headache it is perfect for reading the only thing i didnt like was that i couldnt really tell how far into the book i was i am a huge book lover and i love to feel a real book and turn the pages this kindle gets close to the real book look,this is a great kindle i wanted an ereader that i could 
2.0,it was fun while it worked i thought i could save myself  storage space with a kindle storage space yes  not so much it stopped working after less than 20 books whatever time to find an actual library with real books,it was fun while it worked
3.0,i prefer the straight listing of books on my kindle as the old form had rather than pictures of covers maybe i find out how to get that i also find it difficult to page back,kindle ereader 6 glare free touchscreen

5.0,i received this kindle as a gift i have read books on my laptop so i thought a special toy just to read books was unnecessary i was wrong i really enjoy reading books on this kindle it is small enough to be very portable yet extremely easy to read the font is easily changed the glarefree screen is truly easy to read and is not subject to glare or reflections downloading a book is simple and fast a great experience all around,wonderful gift
3.0,i actually love this reader my only problem is there isnt a light and now i just noticed the light that i was going to get is no longer available otherwise it is good to download books,i actually love this reader my only problem is there isnt a 
3.0,until this new kindle touchscreen i have always given 5 star ratings to the three yes three this is not my first kindle ereader rodeo and i found some of the reviews i read to be quite condescending previous kindle ereaders i have owned i have been extremely frustrated with the sensitivity of the screen when touching it to turn the page and with the constant and truly annoying changing of the font due to it seems to me just breathing a little too hard i generously give this one three stars amazon please consider adding a lock to keep the font from changing so randomly and frequently one reviewer stated that heshe had to change the font 100 times in two days of ownership i find it necessary to change mine 100 times in an evening of relaxing and reading before bedtime something also needs to be done to correct the sensitivity of the screen when turning pages,frustrated kindle touchscreen user
3.0,i really dislike the advertisements that came built in every time i turn it on there is an ad and they stay at the bottom when i go past the first page i bought this for my daughter to read her books why in the world would i want advertisements on this paid device,i really dislike the advertisements that came built in
5.0,great you get the books fast and cheaper although im old school i like to actually have the physical book those books that are milestoneshow to win friendsthink and grow richetci buy the actual bookits a great device as marketed,it is what it is
2.0,this is my first review this version of the kindle is underwhelming the graytinted background offers less contrast than previous versions and thus requires more light to read without straining the eyes im disappointed with my purchase and amazons decreasing standards,im disappointed with my purchase and amazons decreasing standards
5.0,i have seen the kindle before but never bought one i had received the one i have as a gift i just love it easy to download new books its light and so easy to get comfortable in any position to read it i definitely would recommend this,great why did i wait so long to use one
4.0,as an electronic idiot i found getting stated a little tougher than i had imagined now im looking forward to using my kindle since all the books ive ordered are yet to be released,tougher than i thought
5.0,now in its seventh iteration the kindle still reigns supreme as the ebook reader of choice for millions of users it is easy to see why the eink display is easier on the eyes than backlit lcd panels and works without glare or reflection in direct sunlight downloading books is simplicity itself just a single click on the responsive touch screen its small size and light weight make it a pleasure to read wherever you goas an amazon prime member the functionality of the entrylevel kindle is fortified well beyond its low price point with tens of thousands of books in the kindle owners lending library that can be borrowed free of charge each month add a kindle unlimited subscription and you have access to more books than you could ever imagine,still the best choice for reading
4.0,i didnt like how the screen resolution was so ancient looking but i guess that whoever designed this product was going for an old school book look everything else was great though,i didnt like how the screen resolution was so ancient looking

5.0,i originally purchased a kindle fire 7 tablet thinking i could use it to read i didnt do my homework as it is no good for reading outside this is just what i neededit carries easily and is perfect for reading outside,just what i needed
4.0,my only complaint is that there is no light for reading at night seems like an obvious inclusion so i did not realize that this kindle did not have this feature before purchasing,seems like an obvious inclusion
4.0,i bought this kindle with a discount everything is nice touch screen makes it so much easier compared with the model before the only problem is that sometimes its a little slow and there is a lag when i press something but considering the price and the basic model as it is the product is definitely worth the money,everything is nice touch screen makes it so much easier compared

5.0,its perfect been using it every night now and i started reading again it is so light compact and easy on the eyesreally it feels just like a book unlike a paperback you can put it down and read without using your hand to hold the pages it does process faster compared to an older kindle battery life is amazing the only thing i would change is to have a backlight on this but not having a backlight makes it feel more like a real book so thats okay,its perfect been using it every night now
5.0,great,five stars
3.0,the ereader is okay it is smaller and lighter and fairly easy to navigate i bought it strictly for reading books and it serves that purpose i do not like the fact that i cannot adjust the screen brightness i find it very difficult to read in low light even in the day time i dont use it frequently because of that,ereader a disappointment
5.0,great,five stars
5.0,ill be honest it has taken me a long time to come around to switching to digital books i always said it would be the death of print and i like the smell and feel of paper that being said well worth the trade in weight on my daily commute easy to hold not the easiest to navigate that will most likely come with time i would definetly recommend buying a protective case to give it that overall book feel the battery is insane ive only charged it once since i bought it overall smooth transition to digital books,i was skeptical
5.0,great,five stars
5.0,love the kindle received this as a gift and was slightly hesitant to start reading on an ereader but after spending time reading on the kindle it was a very quick adjustment and i dont even notice anymore i would recommend this to any avid reader as it is extremely convenient to purchase books they download in an instant and it will also eliminate clutter in the household so slim you can bring it everywhere great gift and i would recommend this product,love the kindle
5.0,great,five stars
5.0,this was an easter gift for my 12 year old daughter who is an avid reader she loves it i love it because with both of us reading different and sometimes the same material it saves precious space in my home i stayed with the standard kindle rather than the fire so she would be focused on reading and not on apps and games it serves its purpose a tool for reading only which also makes it very affordable,perfect
4.0,great,four stars

5.0,definitely a good decision worth every inch of the price the dictionary function was useful especially when reading vocabrigged or foreign language books in my case french there are a wikipedia function and an experimental web browser just in case one needs it both work just fine i did not buy the paperwhite because i already have good lighting i enjoy reading in the sunlight it is remarkable how this product did not cause any eye strain for almost three hours straight however i do recommend resting your eyes every once in a while,definitely a good decision worth every inch of the price
5.0,i started with the kindle keyboard and loved it but i broke 4 the glass was very fragile my sister gave me a kindle touchscreen for christmas i fought using it for months i wanted my keyboard i finally had to use the touchscreen and i am converted this is not fragile it does not require a cover just to keep from breaking the screen the weight is nothing the battery lasts and last it charges fast the resolution is good i would really like to have 3g but it is not required i personally own 2 working kindle keyboards 1 working small kindle and one large kindle color tablets all are really good products but for reading books the touchscreen is unbeatable so far good work amazon,i started with the kindle keyboard and loved it but i broke 4

5.0,i bought this kindle on a thanksgiving deal for 50 and received in two days a very quick delivery and i rate 5 stars for the service categorythe product packaging is very good this kindle comes with no wall charger but with a usb cable the cable can be used to connect to a laptop to transfer content andor charge the kindle no wall charger for a 80 product is certainly a minus but it is not a deal breaker as kindle uses a micro usb port so it is not hard to find a charger any micro usb charger would work just fine for goodies i give 4 starslike any consumer electronic item this review discusses hardware software and eco system content you use on the kindlehardware the kindle is nicely built with hard plastic and is light weight but feels durable the kindle feels great in hand and you certainly dont need any protective cover so please dont waste money on cases or covers i said hard plastic yes the kindle made with hard plastic eg pvc plastic pipe but not soft plastic eg nokia smart phones so the kindle aesthetics are bad and it looks very cheap however the device doesnt feel any cheap in hand the bezels are wide enough for a nice grip and the device is comfortable to hold the design is very minimal and it is a good thing it just have a power button and a battery charging led indicator the lcd display for reading is fantastic it is certainly not like reading a paper book but it is a very nice way of reading e books with no eye strain make sure you have ample light on kindle screen rating 4 stars hard plastic and lack of wall charger ate 1 pointsoftware the software of kindle is very top notch just touch a word it shows the meaning and how to use it with an example the same word is added to a list amazon calls it vocabulary builder so that you could also check it later there are lots of useful features to make you a better reader everything is great on a kindle except the advertisements the screen always shows an advertisement when you are not using the device so the screen is never turned off amazon claims it doesnt use battery but i will discuss that later these advertisements change based on your amazon activity and your computer browser activity know how cookies work the truth is your device is an advertisement display for amazonrating 4 stars get rid of advertisements on kindle we buy these to read not to look at advertisementseco system eco system is nothing but what you can buy to have on your kindle the e books and cases for kindle etcthere are couple of e book standards such as epub pdf ibook apples docx microsoft word document azw mobi based format amazon uses azw which is based on mobi ebook standard epub is widely supported ebook format however everybody now also supporting amazons format your local library may also supports kindle format but almost all ebook libraries do support epub formatbeing said that it is not hard to find a book on amazon so you are covered if you want some old classic books for free not protected from patent as these books matured the time duration search gutenberg project on your computer this website do have lots of good ebooks in kindle format so you can download and email to your kindle e mail account to read on kindlerating 5 starsi would recommend this product to buy,piece of art

3.0,the only problem i have with this product and its kind of a big one is that if youre reading something with a lot of hyperlinks in the text im reading a travel guidebook which has links to both websites and to other parts of the text it can be very difficult to notclick the hyperlinks when youre just trying to turn the page i wish there were a separate area of the screen dedicated to turning the page where you could tap your finger and know you werent going to hit a hyperlink and have to find your way back to the text you were reading incredibly annoyingother than that i like it good battery life good antiglare,incredibly annoying other than that

5.0,honestly super satisfied i bought this because i have a lot of textbooks for college and its a lot cheaper and a lot more convenient to carry them around on your kindle rather than having actually copies of huge books that are heavy and encumbering im very pleased with it ive been using it non stop since i received it you can also transfer pdfs on it so its useful if you have certain charts or documents that arent books but that you need to have with you at all times i would recommend buying a caseprotection for it though as i left it unprotected in my bag the first day and the black borders got a bit scratched,really useful

3.0,my name is readz alot and i am a biblioholici had held off on buying any sort of ereader for many years i like books i like holding books and handling books and reading books i like being able to flip back 20 pages to check a fact or flip forward to easily see how many pages are left in the chapter i like being able to quickly skim a section that is less interesting and move onwhen this kindle went on sale just before christmas i gave in and bought it figuring id mostly use it for free ebooks from sites like project gutenburg and pulp archive and in general for books that are completely unavailable or outlandishly priced in physical formatthat is indeed what i have mostly used it for ive purchased only a handful of books from amazons kindle store and most of those still fall into the old and hard to find category others are 99 cent megapacks and that that purpose i mostly like it though it does have all the downsides listed above its hard to flip back to check a fact the time to end of the chapter is often quite inaccurate and doesnt work at all on many freebooks and probably not the kindles fault but some free books simply dont seem to work well in the mobi format and end up looking like gibberish on the screenthe biggest downside though is the battery life one of the things that finally tempted me to buy it was the claim of weeksup to 4 weeks battery life hah while i rarely read for more than 12 hours a day i also of course continue to read physical books even with the wifi off im down to half a charge within a couple of days up to is rightthe other downside is that for a biblioholic the temptation to add just one more book its freeonly 99 cents is so powerful i now own more physical books that ill probably ever have time to read and more ebooks ah well,weeks of battery life

5.0,in our family we have multiple iphones and ipads but for the beach we must have our kindles i have tried to enjoy my favorite book on the beach or near the pool with the kindle app on my ipad between the glare and the constant worry of water or sand exposure it wasnt worth the hasslethe kindke is glare free making it a breeze to read in bright sunlight with or without you sunglasses while not water or sand proof the kindle comes in at a much lower price point making damage a little easier to stomach,made for the beachpool

2.0,i have been a kindle owner for over 3 years now i have been extremely happy with my first kindle you see i am an amputee i lost my right arm in a car accident i am also a person who uses a bus to commute each day to my job in seattle so receiving my first kindle as a gift from my sister was a big advantage because of the awkward struggle it is to try and read a paperback or hardbound book with only one handrecently something happened and about 80 of my screen stopped working and the display has a random collection of pixels showing that never change i contacted amazon and reported the problem you promptly sent me and charged me for a replacement kindlewell i have to tell you that i am very frustrated my former kindle was a kindle keyboard what was most advantageous was the buttons on each side of the device that would page forward or page back the buttons being on each side meant that you could easily use it with one hand whether it be the left hand or the right handi realize that having only one hand puts me in a small group of your customer base i further realize that having only a left hand is further minimizing my needs into a smaller demographic of ebook readers but here are my observations• the black portion of the device that constitutes the frame can easily be held from the back but then i cannot reach the screen for the required finger swipe• i can “pinch” the black case between my thumb and fingers but that leaves my thumb as the only finger that can “swipe” or “tap” at the screen to change the page• releasing the device to change the page makes the device “balanced” on my remaining fingers so i am anticipating that this device will end up being dropped to the floor much more frequently than my former and much more useful kindle devicei do understand the futility in hoping for a “deevolution” of your kindle line and i am not ignorant of how few “lefty’s” there are in your customer base i just needed to clarify why i will be looking across the market of readers to see if there is a better device to meet my particular needs i do want you to know that if this situation did not exist i would remain a satisfied kindle customer and user,not all chsanges are good for me
4.0,i bought 3 of these units the first is to replace my keyboard kindle that broke the second two are for my children we all 3 got the kids package with the protector warrenty and no adsi prefer having the buttons to turn pages it has been an adjustment getting used to the touch screen it was also a little difficult to set up the kids so that my adult books were not on their screensall in all these units perform as expected but was more of a difficult transition that i anticipated,slightly difficult transition
5.0,i am a new user of any type of reader so i dont have a lot of expertise and havent fully explored all the options yet having said that i find the device extremely handy i can read it in my favorite chair while waiting in line for something in the brightest sunlight or propped up on my steering wheel while i am waiting for others to do their shopping i love not having to drag a book along the kindle fits right in my purse i have it with me all the time i love it,i can read it in my favorite chair while waiting in line for something
4.0,this item is lightweight and is easy to operate i have not had the opportunity to read outside which is what i bought it for i do suggest if you plan to use this device at night in bed you should be sure to have a light to attach to itl,this item is lightweight and is easy to operate i have not had the opportunity to 
1.0,so the product was greatuntil there was a tiny scratch that poured bright light this light made it hard to read and focus on anything but the scratch i thought customer service would help out like they have before but that was not the case be warned amazon does not perform any repairs this small scratch will cost me a brand new kindlewhich i am not likely to buy because i do not want to feed into the cycle the customer support used to be great but policies must have changed recently because the customer support was terrible that the only option is to buy a brand new kindle or sucks it up,terrible customer service for a great product

5.0,i went from a 2nd generation kindle to this one and i love that it is smaller and lighter i am having to get used to the touch screen as i seem to frequently hit an area that brings up miscellaneous info but admit to not having read the users guide i like that the book cover turns the book off and on quickly some reporters did not like the plastic cover but i am ok with it truly glarefree, a 2nd generation kindle to this one and i love that it is smaller and lighter
3.0,the kindle is fine but its the kindle unlimited thats misleading at best when you say unlimited i read that as being open to anything out there which this program is not seems like you pay the money up front and the selection is older than books at my local library sure wish they could have made it truly unlimited as it was advertised,watch what you sign up for not always what it seems
3.0,this was a gift for my father who is 89 at first while he was getting used to it he liked it after a few weeks he realized the more he used it he found that he had to maneuver the kindle around to eliminate glare it became a nuisance trying to adjust the way he held it constantly he was unable to read it in his room due to glare from the lamps we were able to return it in exchange for the kindle paperwhite which is so much better he can read wherever he wants,a gift for dad
5.0,i purchased my new kindle on prime day after my 2nd generation kindle bit the dust after getting squished on a road trip rip dear kindle friend i was insistent on not getting a light up or back lit version because the whole reason i love the kindle is the real pages look the the eink provides after receiving my new kindle and setting it all up i am thrilled with it i hope that the touch screen doesnt lose its calibration but other that that i dont see any reason i wont love my kindle for years to come the way i did my old one,didnt want to replace my 2nd generation kindle but glad i did
5.0,my wife gave this to me as a christmas gift and it is so enjoyable the interface is very easy to set up and use right out of the box this is my first ereader and the eink display is very easy on the eyes compared to a lcd screen and the battery life is amazing my first use constituted twentythree 23 days of reading averaging 45 minutes per day following a full charge using a microusb port its definitely something i would recommend to others and it lives up to the technical specifications detailed on amazons website great product,amazon kindle ereader
5.0,i bought this kindle to replace my kindle keyboard which finally failed after years of use i like the new kindle it is lighter and more compact than my old keyboard version the touch screen works extremely well and i am very satisfied with this new kindle i have read more and enjoyed reading more since i started using the kindle amazon has a great selection of inexpensive ebooks to choose from and i have been delighted to find old classic mystery and adventure books available if you want to surf the net or watch a video get a tablet if you want to read get a kindle,i like the new kindle

3.0,i have always switched back and forth between using tablet ipad with kindle app vs using kindle the device itself specially during the thanksgiving holidays at under 50 was a very good bargain its small the text is extremely legible and the touch is quite responsive specially when you take into account the context of what you are doing however the problem is in the typography i dont know much about the book ecosystem to know where the blame lies in terms of publishers vs amazon but there shouldnt be any good reasons why after almost 34 revisions of kindle they still fail to put print quality typography on there yes the format is different and might have to be typed differently maybe layout has to be different but publishers should have those tools by now,hardware is great but typography still sucks
4.0,the kindle is fine the leather cover is not as nice as the one i had with my first kindle not as sturdy as the new cover has a cloth piece to hingle the front and back covers together instead of a leather one like my previous one the whole cover just feels cheapnot what i expected from amazonthank you bernie malman,the kindle is fine the leather cover is not as nice as 
5.0,i bought this on sale for 49 i wish i had bought two i already have a kindle touch so i am familiar with how this one works this kindle is much faster than the touch in that it connects to amazon almost instantly the controls like home command are all on top of the screen the battery does seem to work longer but i have not owned it for enough time to truly test this this kindle works well and the operation is smooth,the controls like home command are all on top of the screen
3.0,i like my new kindle however i could download games on my kindle generation 2 and this one does not allow games to be downloaded i miss doing scrabble on it between book readings i would not have purchased this particular kindle had i known,i like my new kindle
2.0,i wanted a way to browse web articles that was safe on the eyes however the experimental browser does not support many websites well especially reddit modern web design is incredibly low contrast on the kindle screen and there is not a reliable way to adjust for that contrast,reads ebooks not web articles
5.0,its perfect for reading it doesnt light up just like a real book i had to convert my files from the epub format but a great free website sends epubs to your kindle for free its so much lighter than a real book and it is easy to hold while reading perfect size to fit in any bag and for traveling battery lasts for days and days,its perfect for reading
2.0,i loved the older generations because it was just a simple ereader unfortunately i had an accident with the older one and now they dont sell the same one anymore first off i dont like the touch screen i seem to accidentally turnhighlight something constantly i like to read before i sleep and even the blanket brushing it sets it off there is no case for it that has a built in light again because i like to read at night before sleeping if i wanted something that had all the bells and whistles then i would have just ordered a tableti wish they would bring back a simpler ereader,bring back a simpler ereader
3.0,kindle is a good ereader with a touchscreen display that reads like a real paper with no screen glare even in bright sunlight it is light weight and has excellent battery life one of my observation is that there is a very slight delay for the text to appear when we move from a page to another i have seen this only in kindle ereader my ectaco reader does not have this delay i personally prefer a much bigger ereader which i believe will make the reading much more easier overall it is a good reader for the price,a good reader for the price
5.0,in the week that ive had my kindle ereader i have fallen hopelessly in love with it it honestly might be an obsession switching to the nook from this i found the display so much easier to navigate than the nook also the ereader is perfect for someone who like me just wants a kindle for the book aspect i dont need something to watch movies on or plays games with i just needed something to store and read ebooks on and the ereader met those needs fantastically also i have found many free book i have enjoyed and the prices of the books reasonable and somewhat cheaper than buying hard copies ordering off a website or even purchasing off the nook would totally recommend to anyone whos looking for a simple yet dashingly perfect ebook reader ❤️,beyond satisified
5.0,this was an unexpected christmas present and i once said id never allow an electronic reading device like this in mu house because i love to hold a book in my hands and turn its pages after learning the other features of the kindle i was wrong about it and i look forward to using it a lot,i was wrong

5.0,i preferred this over the kindle with the bright screen as this looks more like paper from a book it took a little time to get used to but i take this baby every where its dangerous because you can download books whenever wherever,love it
4.0,update 3 november 2014 its been a month and im happy to report my son has frequently read using this simple kindle hes still reading physical books from the library but weve purchased several books from amazon on this device and hes quickly and happily read through them due to the little smudge that developed on the screen ive put this in a case and i hope no more smudges appear battery life has been awesome in comparison to led devices and nobody has had to interrupt their reading to find a charger and its been fully charged maybe 3 times in a monthi bought this valuepriced kindle to solve a problem my 9 year old son loves to read he will tear through a harry potter book in a couple of days but he has no interest in reading on a regular tablet whether it be one of the ipads in the house or the kindle fire hd something about the experience basically staring at a white lamp for hours keeps him from enjoying it like he enjoys traditional paper books bu read more,great once you start reading
5.0,my sister in law visited us from the us and gave me one as a gift awesome really nice i was using a normal kindle before and had to have a light that ate batteries and found it super frustrating having to change batteries in the middle of the nightwell done amazon truly an amazing product and so easy to log in and all my books are saved in the cloud so it was seamless to retrieve them and read quickly,truly an amazing product well done amazon
5.0,it is everything i hoped for as a senior citizen i wanted something useful and easy to operate i am not a technical person i wanted something that did not require a background in computer science i love to read and i wanted something that would allow me to have books without taking up space for bookcases in the house or require recycling some to have more available room the user guidebook is on the kindle do not expect a separate paper guidebook the guidebook is clearly written,everything i hoped for
5.0,well i bought my kindle on thursday 11th and the order arrive on tuesday 16th i mean the shipping is really fast even when u live in the end of the world like meim really happy with my new kindle and above that im so so happy with the attention of amazon really the attention is excellent anything that you need they will help youi had some questions and i contacted them between chat and they helped me and resolve my questionsthe kindle is perfect i loved itthanks amazon,like me im really happy with my new kindle 
4.0,i gave it a four star rating because i am still learning about the kindle and what he has on it i will eventually like to purchase some books but until i takehave the time to learn more it will be a while yet i think it will be a great asset for me,i will eventually like to purchase some books but until i takehave the 
1.0,display to dim to use in anything but brightest environment after long discussion with the first customer service agent when i inquired how to increase the brightness she cath passed me to a second agent tejaswi whose first question was whether i was trying to tradein a kindle obviously he hadnt read any of the preceding chat then he wrote a member of our kindle specialist team will be the perfect person to help you with this let me connect you to a member of our specialist team it will only take a moment i was then transferred to the perfect person to help me with my problem that perfect person syed then asked me you want to reduce the brightness in your 3rd kindle so much for perfection customer service was abysmal,cant use this device in less than great lighting but its still better than kindle customer service reps
5.0,its really a fantastic and uncomplicated way to read books it almost looks like a genuine book page which is what makes it such a great reading experience having your entire library at your fingertips doesnt hurt either,almost like paper
4.0,miss my old one i had one of the original which i broke i am getting used to it like the touch screen as when i read kindle books on other devices they are touch screen and i used to touch the screen on old one and then remember that doesnt work ha there does seem to be a little more glare than with old one but not as much as with my other devices,pluses and minuses
4.0,works well pages turn fast and contrast makes it easy to ready allows for easy changing of text size for anyone who may forget their glasses or need larger letters in low light conditions,pages turn fast and contrast makes it easy to ready
1.0,since this device is usable only with ambient light if you are searching for anything else dont buy it save yourself time and money when the display arrived i quickly discovered the only way to increase screen intensity was with an outside light source unlike the far superior product the paperwhite this device only provides portrait displayno landscape so if you are sitting in the sun all day and want something to read on i suppose this is the product for you otherwise spend the extra bucks for the paperwhite ps if you do return it be sure to check doesnt work otherwise amazon charges you 298 for return postage not a great charge but still for a product unusable except in the most limited circumstances,unlike the far superior product the paperwhite
2.0,it is glare free but swiping quickly became tedious and searching for directions etc was very frustratingi do not enjoy it because i am a very fast reader and swiping slows me down,uk
5.0,works great exactly as advertised wish i had sprung for one of the 3g kindles but thats on me i switched from using the kindle app on my ipad air 2 to using this because of readability,great ereader
3.0,i do not like all the clutter of ads for books that appear they are extremely annoying i like the kindle size fits easily into my purse could live without the touch screen but its ok,i do not like all the clutter of ads for books that appear
1.0,the special offers are completely worthless i have absolutely no interest in the special offers whatsoever the device itself is great but why wouldnt it offer me discounts on ebooks in my wishlist or maybe even in my recommended list,the device itself is great but why wouldnt it offer me discounts on 
2.0,very disappointed with this kindle i had to purchase a clip on light for around 20 bucks just so i could use it the one improvement is the touch screen makes one hand operation possible,wish my original kindle didnt die
3.0,i like the product but just wish it were better in no so optimal lighting i find it can be difficult to read if the room is not very well lit otherwise i love it super easy to use,i like the product
5.0,it is great non glare do not have to charge it very often so it just keeps trucking just have problems getting the books to come into only my kindle problem still not resolved mary,it is great non glare
5.0,good basic kindle reader takes a few days to get used to the swipe instead of the button to turn page but not really a big deal easy to add to my amazon account working good so far,good basic kindle reader
5.0,for someone like myself that reads 1500wpm this is perfect i never run out of books to read i love that i can carry a small lightweight tablet with me instead of big bulky books im ambiguous about not having the actual physical book because i will reread them but every appropriate available space in my home is book occupied so not accumulating more is good in that aspect i like that i can highlight certain passages and share them on facebook with my friends i havent found a single negative with this product very very pleased with my kindle,im in love
1.0,i had a kindle that i loved and carried with me all over the world this one doesnt have the same formatthe buttons to change pages are different there are no buttonsand im having a terrible time adjusting to this i am 75 years old and dont own an ipad or smartphone where one sweeps their finger across the screen to change pages furthermore i dont like not knowing the page im on read is one step better than useless but the old kindle was the same way,i had a kindle that i loved and carried with me all over the world
5.0,great if you want to feel like youre still reading an actual book lightweight and fits easily into an averaged sized purse also you can wear nontouchscreen gloves to use the touch screen which is something i was worried about when purchasing super happy,great feels like im reading an actual book
3.0,im a creature of habit so when i lost my old trusty kindlei expected something greater with my new investment the love of a touchscreenbig dealtakes some getting used to and a bit of a hassle going to cloud coming back it also comes on when you uncover the screen dont know how it does that but it does would rather just push the on button when i want it onthe readability is really not better than one of the original kindles so perhaps im being harsh it works fine its just not better imho,the love of a touchscreen
4.0,i like reading on this more than i expected glare free is a slight overstatement it is kind of like coated paper which has a slight glare if the angle is just right it definitely is better than a phone or tablet screen and you can change your angle slightly to avoid any slight glare you can see,i like reading on this more than i expected
4.0,i love this little kindle2 things would have given it a 5 star rating 1 id love to be able to shelve my books in collections like you can on other brands of ereaders i made collections on my kindle keyboard and when it updated it wiped them all outtook me forever to put over 1000 books where i wanted them 2 i cant find a reasonably priced case for this anyplace local,i love this little kindle
4.0,i like the build of this ereader its very lightweight the sides are flat and a bit wider than on the paperwhite the plastic on the back is a bit rougher as well but i think both of these features combine to make it easier to keep a steady grip on the device as well as making it feel more durable the text is nicely dark though a few of the fonts could be a shade darker such as palatino the wide selection of fonts is nice however my only real complaint and the reason i did not give the full five stars is the fact that the font sizes are too limited and range from basically way to small to way to large with only one size that i was actually comfortable reading with other than this tiny flaw though i think this is a solid ereader that is well worth its price,low cost high quality
5.0,this is a great gadget thanks to the amazon team that help me to get it it is so amazing to be able to get so many books in this light kindle reading is a big part of my life and i love it and getting the keyboard by touch is fantastic the letters in my old kindle were getting erasedthanks againelizabeth s,this is a great gadget thanks to the amazon team that help 
5.0,i purchased this kindle to replace an old 2nd gen device very happy with the size weight and features really easy to use but do suggest reading through the user guide to learn about all this device can do,another excellent product
3.0,i dont like having to touch the screen so many times just to turn the page in the home device or cloud settings if i could touch the screen just like i do when im reading a book would be wonderful other than that i really like my new kindle it has a lot of options that are going to take me a while to learn but im looking forward to it,page turning
5.0,everyone loved these,five stars
2.0,i received this as a gift for christmas and am returning it because of the followingi do not like the gray background with the black letters too difficult to read even when making the characters biggeri do not like seeing ads every time i leave my page and come back oni will be getting a paperwhite,i do not like the gray background with the black letters

4.0,good unit but i wish there was a way to turn pages without touch screen maybe a side button as an option as sometimes when i am reading i inadvertently touch the screen and turn the page,good unit good price but a little touchy
2.0,bought the wrong kindle i guess had to return it no light to turn on on this model they shouldnt even make a kindle without a light to turn on how can you read it without a back light,no light to read in the dark
5.0,pretty awesome reader no light but the e ink display looks enough like a paper book that i think to myself real books dont have lights either good size for the device great reading platform,good size and great reading
5.0,i had an older gen kindle but my dog literally chewed it up one evening when we were out so i got the newer gen and im glad i did i do like that its touch screen but its bigger and bulkier than the older gens with buttons however it does weigh less because now i think its more plastic with a cover on it looks like a book and that ads arent that annoying,so i got the newer gen and im glad i did
4.0,so far so good i have a kindle fire that i really like but needed something i could read easily outside also reading on the backlit fire for extended periods of time would hurt my eyes so this small kindle has worked well battery life is great screen is a little too sensitive but i will get used to it all in all for what i needed it for i am happy with it,so far so good i have a kindle fire that i really 
5.0,several years ago i bought a kindle fire i still like it but reading out of doors with a fire is virtually impossible now when i download a book i download to both devices so when i read on one it is synced to the other i also like the lightness of this kindle this kindle does not come with a power adapter but if you already own a fire that power cord will work just fine if you are looking for a cheap device to get you started or one to supplement your fire this is the one for you,different strokes er kindle for different folks
5.0,i love this thing its great to throw in my purse and go i bought it when amazon had it at a limited offer special price of 59 with the advertising software on it hey its a very minimal applicationand i decided it was too good of a price to not jump in its simple and i dont mind the very small annoyance of the advertising i love the touch screen to turn the pages i cant understand the folks that would rather have the antiquated version with physical buttons a simple touch of you finger turns the page forward or backwardi ordered a nice leather book style case for mineandi love this thing,this kindle is fabulous
5.0,i just love it its compact enough to carry in my medium size handbagi enjoy reading from it instead of holding a large heavy book with my athritichands the pages are simple to turn thanx,i just love it its compact enough to carry in my 
5.0,this is a nice simple ereader it is pretty lite weight and easy to handle i bought this because i was sick of reading on my tablet the glare was bothering my eyes i like the touch features previous versions had the back and forward buttons on the sides the swiping motion is similar to a tablet and is easier to manipulate it functions exactly like the kindle app for my tablet with the ability to browse the kindle store and purchase books it does not have a back light you will need a clip on light if you want to read in the dark i knew this when i bought it it is cheaper to purchase a clip on light and read that way then it is buy the next model up paper white,this is a nice simple ereader
4.0,i broke my first kindle and wanted to replace it with like kind so i could use my cover on it i accidentally ordered the paper white take into consideration that i am 72 years old so far so good there is a steep learning curve for me but i am enjoying the new kindle, my first kindle and wanted to replace it with like kind so i could use my cover on it
4.0,i had the kindle touch for a few years loved it but recently broke it rocked over it with a rocking chair i decided to order the updated version of the kindle so far it works pretty similarly to an older touch kindle the one thing i dont like about this product is it is a little boxy and the plastic feels really cheap compared to the kindle touch,works just like the old kindle touch but feels plasticy and boxy
5.0,needed to replace my kindle as the original was destroyed along with its protective case by my rescued dog this edition is excellent for my reading purposes and small enough with the case i purchased to be hiding from the aforementioned canine in my purse an additional thanks to your customer service representative who laughed with me about the loss and answered all my kindle questions,just what i needed
5.0,exactly as advertised,five stars
5.0,am having fun with it,five stars
1.0,i bought 2 of these from a local retailer however both of them when the screen is locked shows adds instead of a nice splash screen like mine and my wifes paperwhites there is no reason that my kids should have to look at advertisements every time they go to read a book i have turned off all adds in the settings to no avail very disappointed in these,too many adds
2.0,the screen is not illuminated i must have room light i cannot use it in bed with no lights on i especially cannot reverse the illumination white letters on black big loss from earlier model,the screen is not illuminated i must have room 
3.0,the kindle i received from amazon was sealed and wrapped up but it still had a scratch on its surface that bothers me when i read i am not sure what to do about this what would amazon recommend rosaleen salvo,what would amazon recommend rosaleen
5.0,the kindle charged up for first time use faster than i anticipated its great i love carrying this rather than a book wont give up books butthe kindle is more convenient and portable for me sometimes packaging was hassle free instructions clearall positive,its great i love carrying this rather than a book
4.0,i love it it feels like a book the only thing that i dont like is that it doesnt change brightness so you have to read it with light it also seems like it is never off because of all the ads,i love it it feels like a book
2.0,unable to figure out how to access most of the functions of this kindlethis is my fourth kindle and the others were much easier to use fromthe start i still cant brighten my screen,unable to figure out how to access most of the 
3.0,not read good the pdf,three stars
5.0,grandaughter loves it,five stars
5.0,its a great little device the battery seems to last forever and the screen is crisp and legible in all conditions i do wish it had a backlight and that i couldnfind the appropriate accessories more easily but thats what i get for not choosing the next tierif you need a dependable light function focused device at a low price this is the one for you the ads are kind of annoying spring for the no ads version if you can,its a great little device
5.0,its my first kindle am so happy i bought it easy to use it makes reading books more enjoyable one surprising issue i wasnt expecting the fact that i have to buy the charger separately thats sounds awkward,am so happy i bought it
5.0,i love that i can read outside with no glare for anyone wanting to read in a dark or dimly lighted room do not buy this particular kindle this kindle works like a regular print book and is read when light is available i am thrilled it is strictly an ereader so the kids are never begging me to download games to it now if i could just figure out how to retire very early and read all day,perfect for me
4.0,its a nice reader but i still need to learn how to use it i like it i need to learn how to keep my books in a place when im done reading them just in cast i want to go back and reread them or sale them or donate them i have to continue to read the kindle users guide,kindle 6
4.0,this is a great kindle it is lightweight and easy to carry the glarefree touchscreen display ensures i can read for hours without a headache much like a traditional paper book the touchscreen is responsive and easy to use the one thing the kindle lacks is in the structural quality the hardshell is a plastic i can imagine cracking after one drop on a hard surface if you intend to travel with the kindle and dont want the screen or body to crack definitely buy a case,lightweight easyreading needs a case
2.0,it did not share my notes to facebook like my kindle paperwhite keyboard did this new one is somehow connected with goodreads and formats the post with items that are not correct example when you high light a few lines to post with your comment is always assumes that the high lighted section is a quote by the author and will say john shared a quote by don won although don won is the author of the book but the high lighted section may be far from the quote of the author it also has images associated with the books that post that are not really that accurate either it is also too small to handle and could not get used to the smaller size i also missed the audio feature i had with my keyboard model i sent it back and found the old keyboard paperwhite model on ebay for 40 and it is like new i could not be happier it is too bad they do not make the keyboard model anymore my first one the screen died after two years,it did not share my notes to facebook like my kindle paperwhite keyboard did
5.0,i have always enjoyed reading since the first days that i gained the ability ive wanted to read everything in sight but ive always found that taking a bunch of books everywhere with you is bothersome they take up too much space and it grinds on my sense of order to have my books scattered about with this device i have them all literally at my fingers tips a tap swipe and click away and whats more i cant even describe to you how much i like reading the eink screen combine the potential for thousands of books at your disposal on one device and a screen that feels so natural that you wish paper books looked as good and you have one heck of a product,i like this so much better than i do paper books
5.0,ive got an hd7 as well and enjoy it but the ereader is still the best and closest thing to an actual book the device is very light and has great battery life if you do a lot of reading the display is a nice feature that doesnt put a lot of strain on your eyes,like reading a book
4.0,i got my kindle as a christmas gift because my dad knows that i love to read its really lightweight and small so its nice for travel however there are a couple of things that bug me a little one of them is the lighting although its glarefree you cant see the screen in darkness i like to read in the car and sometimes its night outside i did get a reding light for it though so that helps a little another is the fact that it doesnt show page numbers when i read a book there is the percentage of the book that youve read so far and a location number but i still would rather see page numbersone thing that i was really happy to see is that i am able to access goodreads from my kindle i had recently got an account on the site and was disappointed when i couldnt get the app on my ipod because of its version however you do need wifi to access goodreads along with most of the other operations on the device besides reading booksmaterials that have already been purchased and downloaded over all i am very happy with my kindle and have added a lot of books to my wish list,overall great device
2.0,the kindle 6 glarefree touchscreen is way too dark i am having big trouble reading it because i waiting too long to return the item i will give it to my granddaughter or grandson i really made a poor purchase,i really made a poor purchase
5.0,love the compact size and light weight i was afraid i would be irritated by the small screen but it hasnt phased me one bit i had been using a full tablet to read but was reading less and less due to the amount of screen time every day now im back to reading every free minute i get and not getting eye strain from the back light,best money spent
5.0,works great i love it,works great i love it

5.0,really good investment,i love my kindle
5.0,my students love these,five stars
1.0,first the battery needs to be constantly recharged if you are using the backlight which is most of the time the unit does minifreezes constantly when trying to play simple games when reading you have to consciously avoid toughing any part of the screen or you will either turn a page back forward or most usually find yourself in a menu that you have to spend time getting the heck out ofif you have large fingers trying to point to a single word for a definition invariably results in your highlighting a whole section of works so you have to lose more time exiting that areawhile touchscreens may be ok for cell phones they are a complete disaster for e readers games such as every word become impossible to use as one advances to new levels the letters become so long a line at the bottom that you often trigger hitting the margin thus moving to yet another menu you dont want one would think amazon would have tested this inane system of book reading and game playing before sticking this junk on the worldi sorely miss my old reader that had the tabs on the side for advancing each page that preloaded words into every word that made editing etc simple now it is a complete utter disaster shame on amazon,worse product in their line
3.0,this device has very limited functionsyou actually can read only in text format pdf is useless because letters are too small you cant watch pictures and movies to download books directly from internet is not so important the kindle is not independent from pc needs hot spots to download books therefore most users have computers at home more advanced kindles in the range of 120 are much better but other competitors devices of such abilities are cheaper,pdf is useless because letters are too small
1.0,i guess i expected more after reading the reviews but it was better than thinking what if so now many of my questions were answered and cleared up i returned the item but everyone has to go by their own preference please dont stop ordering just because i returned my kindle everything is not for everybodyits good to be different,it was better than thinking what if so now
1.0,should include a hard copy users manual not clear how to get it started started a free trial on a newspaper and cant figure out how to get todays edition onto the kindle will probably now sign up to get the paper on the kindle can get a digital version for same price on email link to my pc,should include a hard copy users manual not clear 
5.0,enjoying my kindle immensely no problems so far it appears that everything was thought through carefully theres even a kindle users guide already in your kindle for easy reference ive only call amazon technical support once the only challenge now is do i read my kindle or do i read a regular book great problem for reading gurus to have,theres even a kindle users guide already in your kindle for easy reference ive only call amazon technical support once
4.0,took a while to learn to use a kindle and the device does not have a port for email which meant i could not use it as i had expected but surely it will prove useful as my eyes already need larger print size,a moderately useful device
5.0,great,five stars
5.0,i really like it so easy to use hope you keep making a nonbacklit black and white actually pale grayreader so easy on the eyes i know several people with dyslexia and they are able to enjoy reading with this version of the kindle for those of you considering a kindle this is the one i would recommend if you like curling up with a good book and reading for several hours at a stretch i have a tablet and my eyes tire much faster with it so i dont do a lot of reading for pleasure on it thats why i bought this kindle,i recommend this type of kindle for the avid reader
5.0,great,five stars
5.0,i am obsessed at first i was a little put off by the fact that it didnt light up at all and was black and white after using it for a few days though i fell in love its the perfect size and its like reading the pages of a real book except better i take it with me evvverywhere i dont know if ill buy a paper book again also they sell nifty little clip on book lights that are perfect for reading at night if youre on the fence about this kindle go for it,i am obsessed
5.0,great,five stars

5.0,i am a 20 year old college guy who has a million distractions in his life from xbox to his phone to class to work etc and this makes me actually want to sit down and read i always get distracted by looking on in physical books but the kindle helps me to focus on what i am reading at the moment and nothing more if you want to start reading again or just need somewhere to begin look no further,finally i actually want to read
5.0,great,five stars
5.0,my 6 glarefree touchscreen is just what the doctor ordered for my eyes i had eye surgery cataracts removed from the left eye on october 311914 reading on the is a breeze the kindle was a christmas present the best present i could have received,good on the eyes

4.0,i love my kindle and the kindle program there are two minor problems with my now device 1 it is smaller than my original device no problem with the text but it no longer fits into the book cover i bought for my old kindle i will have to replace that 2 the package didnt come with an instruction booklet it has taken me a while to figure out how to locate the home page review stored editions shop in the store etc if you have some guidance for that us older types would appreciate it jad,i love my kindle and the kindle program

2.0,i am looking to get an ereader but want a screen a little larger than 6 maybe 8 or so for me the kindle screen is a little too small dont want the fire because of the shorter battery time besides i already have a tablet so dont need that other stuff the fire can do just want a simple ereader that i can use to read books just that,want a larger ereader to just read books
5.0,i love my kindle its exactly what i wanted my 2nd gen kindle would no longer hold a charge i loved it because i didnt want something with a light in it i wanted a simple ereader that read like a regular book this does that and it still has all the bells and whistles too like connecting to goodreads xray is a fun feature too i find it helpful to easily go to the next book in a series and download it quickly i love the feature that tells you how much time is left in each chapter or to finish the book the one negative i might have is the suggested books at the bottom of the screen id prefer to not see that all the time,i love my kindle
4.0,i really like it already read my first book the idea of thousands of books at my fingertips in an instant is very cool portable light weight touch screen is a plus text is clear if your searching on amazon online through the kindle though the pictures are blurry i was disappointed with the purchasing when i thought i purchased a book series but it turned out to be just one book from that series for 15 i was unable to resolve the issue on the kindle and needed to go on my laptop to cancel the order amazon did provide me with a full refund which was nice that is a separate issue from the actual device though i enjoy the kindle and hope you do too,i really like it already read my first book
4.0,thanks,four stars
3.0,i was very disappointed in this kindle nothing in the specifications told me that i would need a wifi router to use it my first kindle could be used anywhere i cared to use it  so i thought this one would be just as easyi ended up giving it to my sil who has a wifi hookup and is willing to play with itthe advertising should have made that clearer to those who are only somewhat able to understand techie talk,i was very disappointed in this kindle
4.0,great,four stars

4.0,the improved screen contrast is impressive however not including the power adapter is just plain chintzy especially at the price to buy one from amazon at 20 power adapters are not that expensive normally so this part is a rip off if you have a power adapter from a previous kindle dont waste your money buying one here i do miss the side buttons for page turning as id much prefer them to touch screen the options for getting a kindle with the side buttons arent great mostly either buy a rebuilt or buy one used looked around and could not find one new or id have bought it otherwise this is a good basic kindle that allows you to read e books,if you have a power adapter from a previous kindle dont waste your money buying one here
4.0,great,four stars
5.0,i was given a kindle fire and thought it was great and it is if i want to use other apps shop amazon or even read a magazine color pages but the light on the screen and the temptation to just check facebook was not conducive to reading it was also bigger and bulkier and the battery doesnt last as long i still love the fire and use it often but for reading this is my goto devicei ordered this one just for reading and i absolutely love it it fits in my purse and goes everywhere with me i can carry lots of books with me on vacation or camping or just to the doctors office and read whatever im in the mood for the charge lasts a long time and its readable in all sorts of lighting situations its actually lighter and easier to hold than a real book,my goto reading device

5.0,easy to read on works great in bright sunlight and battery life is excellent you do have to get used to the screen going black for a moment when switching pages and navigating menus but the other ereaders ive had do the same i thought the small screen would bother me but it doesnt at all the free offers are just a screen saver and are worth the drop in price,totally worth the money

5.0,i love my new kindle its the first one ive bought the first one i had was a hand me down i didnt think i would like a kindle being an avid reader and book lover but since i had a free one second generation i gave it a try and fell in love gone are the biweekly trips to the library lugging around arm loads of heavy books some of which i didnt have time to read or just didnt like and occasionally had previously read also the fines for readers like my self i recommend a paper white version i have over a thousand books on my new one already most of which i got free i dont think i have spent over five dollars on one yet the kindle unlimited is the way to go also i almost cried when i dropped my first one and broke it i had dropped the thing a hundred times literally im so happy with my new one its hard to put in words,im in love

5.0,i bought this particular kindle because i wanted to be able to read outside in the sunshine and i am extremely pleased with my purchase the brighter the light is the crisper the text is i love it the special offer is on the lock screen only and does not interfere with my reading i hardly even notice it i highly recommend this kindle if you only want to read in bright light since it is not backlit, read outside in the sunshine and i am extremely pleased with my purchase

5.0,i absolutely love my kindle  it was given to me as a gift for christmas what an absolute treat its been i was always a voracious reader but as i got older i found that i could be allergic to library books dust inks etc i got tired of not feeling well while reading so i stopped going to the library im trying the kindle unlimited plan to hopefully catch up with reading some of the things i missed in the last number of years im so thankful to my friend kathleen who gifted the kindle to me i couldnt be happier ps this kindle doesnt have backlighting so i cant read in the dark when i purchase another id probably prefer to have that feature which i think is available in the paperwhite or other versions of kindle but even without it im still on cloud 9,i absolutely love my kindle
5.0,great,five stars
3.0,the special offers that appear on my home screen after i log in are a bit irritating as they take up half the screen and are not on subjects that im interested in if theres a way to change my ad preferences to display something more relevant i havent found it yet furthermore there are very few good options for cases that include a light and none i could find that were slim and light and drew power from the kindle battery like in previous models if my mom hadnt wanted this one i would have returned it and bought something else instead,there are very few good options for cases that include a light
5.0,a plus,five stars
5.0,bought this as a gift for my wife she absolutely loves the display the problem she was having with her kindle fire was the that the screen was hard to read while in the sun this glarefree kindle gives her the ability to read while hanging out with the family by the pool,a great gift and a great product
5.0,woohoo,five stars
3.0,the viewing angle of the screen is narrower than my antique kindle the rim of the unit is so narrow that i unintentionally change pages and im not a big fan of touchscreens on such a small space i havent been able to change settings to my preference i also need a way to delete old material items that i deleted from my old kindle while not on line are returning i dont need to keep all the samples and uninspiring books,unconvinced
4.0,this is exactly what i expected a light easy to use product the battery lasted at least a month the kindle remembered where i was in each book so i could easily switch from book to book sadly my too large young dog chewed it up and now it no longer works i will be replacing it,a light easy to use product
1.0,i am very disappointed it does do a good job outside which is a great thing but not so good inside i have to have a lot of lights on to read my house is never bright enough to read the screen and there are not brightness controls in addition i would prefer to listen to many of my books and there is no bluetooth or audio output for this to happen i find it difficult to navigate thru the book except 1 page at a time i cannot flag pages easily yes it is nice to lay it down and read without holding but i do not enjoy having to hold it,i am very disappointed it does do a good job outside

5.0,amazing how this thing works i still struggle a bit with navigating around the menu but thats just a matter of my learning curve i like that i can adjust the font size to suit my vision and to think that i can have several books at once on this little tabletamazing,amazing how this thing works
3.0,need a light to read it whereas the nook does not this was not made clear in the advertising i have both kindle and nook the kindle is lighter fits in the pocket but the nook can be read anywhere is larger more words on page seemingly more user friendly if you like reading in bed without disturbing anyone get the nook if you read in the sunshine get the kindle,needs external light source
1.0,my kindle is a few years old and i loved it but the screen broke opened my case one day and half the screen was blank and the only way to read the books i bought is to buy a new one im going back to traditional paper books if a paperback gets ruined its only 3 to replace not 80,fun while it lasted
1.0,i am not happy with this reader i should have researched better but thought i could read at night but cant without a light on the dicrispiton said no glare can read in any light it was my error to not search further i didnt start using my reader till after 30 days so couldnt send it back i dont use it very often,not happy
5.0,i am loving my kindle the battery life is amazing the screen is perfect and the form factor is greatif you enjoy reading or used to enjoy reading and need to get back into it do not hesitate in making this purchase,i have rekindled my love of reading thanks to the kindle
1.0,we purchased 2 of these for our children who love to read and we cant keep enough books in the house for them unfortunately the low low price this review of 1 star reflects the quality of the product one unit came infected with malware right out of the box purchased as new thru amazon prime and was unusable the second was difficult to set up browsing at our local library but once i found a round about way i was able to check out books i discovered that even though a library book is checked out kindle still requires you to set up an account including personal information in order to read a book that is not associated with amazon the book belongs to the county library not amazon this reader was purchased for a child who does not have an amazon account and does not need one the screen was difficult to read and the refresh rate was horrible any slight touch on the screen cased it to blink flash and break up i would not suggest purchasing this product even if you are tech wavy its just not worth the effort we are a big amazon family and purchase products regular from them and plan to continue i am just very disappointed and a bit shocked they would support a product as poor as this,very dissappointed in product
5.0,love my kindle bought it to replace an older model that would no charge anymore i like the basic kindle instead of the tablet style it keeps me from downloading games i just use it to read and it is perfect,love my kindle

5.0,i commute to work everyday by train and this makes it easier to read when i only have one free hand most days ill have to stand and hold onto a railing and with the kindle i can turn pages with the tap of my fingeri still prefer physical books over digital but this is well worth the price even if its only for the convienence,i commute to work everyday by train and this 
5.0,love love love my kindle,this is awesome
4.0,it does the job of providing glare free reading experience i love the long battery life between charges although that might be due to a noncolor providing screen i didnt fully understand the idea of a backlit display until i tried reading it in low lighting definitely need to have the lights on,i love the long battery life between charges
3.0,its very light and easy to read using one hand which is good my big disappointment is that the screen is not nearly as good as i expected beyond the fact that you cant use it at night even during the day the screen seems unusally dark at times and in places and is not easay to read perhaps im missing something as to how to manipulate the visitbility of the screen but if not this is a drawback in my view,its very light and easy to read using one hand
5.0,for anyone who likes to read i would recommend this product i was pretty much set on always have the real deal but my friend bought one and i played around with it and its amazing really long battery life actually no glare with amazon prime you can rent books for free every month and its just so small and light weight traveling with it is not an issue at all,for anyone who likes to read i would recommend this product
3.0,the kindle 6 glarefree is nice however my previous kindles had text to speech that i miss,three stars
3.0,my daughters 4 year old kindle touch become unresponsive and support was unable to resolve the issue so we needed a replacement and my daughter wanted it replaced with the same version the kindle 6 glarefree touchscreen was closest in style and features to her previous version so this was her choice it does not feel as sturdy or seem to be made with the same high quality materials and workmanship as the original kindle touch ie it feels cheap time will tell how it will holdup to daily use and getting stuffed into a backpack,it does not feel as sturdy or seem to be made with the same high 
5.0,👍👍👍,five stars
5.0,it is really really good i already have an android device and i always thought why would i want a kindle then i saw this version on sale and decided to give it a try and now i just cant expect to read anything else without it it is much much better than reading in any device with a bright display it is just like a book but with the upside of carrying lots of books it does not make your eyes tired and the possibility of using the dictionary on the fly just rocks i am really happy with it,really good i already have an android device and i

4.0,ordered the kindle for my mother she loves it this is the first time i purchased a kindle the only thing i dont like about it the display does not light up and you cant make the screen brighter would i order another one no likely id fine a kindle that allows me to turn the brightness updown instead of being one monotone color the work around is to just make the font much larger which makes it easier to read when the text is larger,the only thing i dont like about it
5.0,great,five stars
5.0,bought this for mother n law who is 94 she has been reading on it for four days and only has one time where she lost her way i would say this a great success rate she loves it and wanted to know why we never got one of these new thingies when she was younger omg the kindle reader is the best thing sense dirt or should i say paperbacks,i would say this a great success rate
5.0,kindle is a very nice ebook reader easier to use with dictionaries and vocabulary improvement and a system of quotations this ebook reader allow you to have a comfortable reading experiencethe only kindles problem is not be able to read epub books,kindle is a very nice ebook reader
5.0,i love my kindle it motivates me to read so much more than before i had it it allows me to check webpages which is very convenient when i dont have my phone with me but doesnt have all the apps to distract me from reading great product,i love my kindle
3.0,i am unable to download games on this kindle as we did on my original and second kindle have a difficult time navigating therefore have not given to our daughter yet until i can figure out how to get some games on it like every word and every word crossing these were so beneficial to our handicapped daughter to help her with her reading etccould i trade this one for one of the original kindle that is manual to use our daughter understands the original one after three years,have not given to our daughter yet until i can figure out how to get some games on it like every word and every word
5.0,this is great books on tap,five stars
4.0,i really love the size simplicity and functions particularly the dictionary function for words of the kindle i may be missing something but it would be great if there was a way to change the coloring of the fontcontrast of the font for different lights  i know other versions of the kindle can do this,i really love the size
2.0,i am still trying to figure out how to bookmark on my new kindle however i did mange to find my opened book after i closed my kindle for the night now i also have to learn how to put a book when finished reading it into the cloud lots to learn so for now i give my new kindle a 2 star rating actually my old kindle is much better,my old kindle is much better
5.0,i love this product works exactly as described i can go through all the books i want take it with me anywhere and plug it in when i get home i can get through an average sized book 250 pgs without it running out of charge,works as expected
3.0,i didnt know that it required wifi nor that most of the free books were only available with a 999month membership it was only after i placed my order that i saw that there were covers available for about a third of what i paid,not what i expected
5.0,after reading some reviewer comments regarding the sensitivity of the new touch screen i had some reservations but i find the touch screen an improvement over the buttons on the side of my previous kindle the new eink does seem sharper and the screen easy to see in most lighting access to the dictionary is easier and quicker and getting around in the menu is simple and intuitive this is my third kindle and each has been an improvement on its predecessor,the new eink does seem sharper and the screen easy to see in most lighting
3.0,its good for my son but i didnt realize it doesnt have a backlit screen for when its dark i dont think i would have gotten it and it doesnt seem to be able to put restrictins on purchases because we have to buy through my amazon account,its good for my son but i didnt realize it doesnt 
5.0,ive been reading so much more since i got my kindle i easily rent kindle edition books from my local library while at home i like that this edition is in black and white so im not tempted to use it to go on websites such as facebook for me my kindle is strictly for reading a welcome break from the internet i recently took it on a trip and could carry it in my purse much more convenient than lugging around multiple books there are a few books i will always own in hard copy as a minimalist living in a small space i am happy to store everything else on my kindle,saves space more convenient and i find i am reading more
5.0,love how lightweight it is,five stars
4.0,this was one great book reading device my only issue was not being able to add my own documents to my kids library so they dont touch my progress which would force me to by another kindle just for themyet i would recomment paper white more as a better deal since reading at dark with this one is impossible and having an external light is not a good optioni managed to change the fonts in this device to display arabic language much more better and it really did fine,this was one great book reading device
4.0,prefer non touchscreen unit,good ebook
3.0,after being used to the kindle fire im kind of sorry i bought this version to replace it fire no longer charging reliably i find the smaller screen fine for reading books but i dont like the layout for listing my books it shows tiny black and white book covers that i find difficult to read in some cases also it doesnt appear that i can turn the device horizontally to see larger images finally on the home page the top half of the screen shows my books but the bottom half shows books i might want to buy id rather just see my books a little larger so i can read the titles i didnt think i necessarily needed all the bells and whistles of the fire since i basically used it for reading books and rarely for any other reason but i miss the look of it the larger screen and the color elements,a little disappointing but delivers what is promised
1.0,im sure if i had an owners manual i would love the kindle but without any help in finding out why it keeps saying there is no wifi connection when 30 seconds earlier it had a wifi connection i cant get the blasted thing to work if you could just send some instructions as to how to use it i think it would be a marvelous item but without the help i really should have rated it with no stars, sure if i had an owners manual i would love the kindle
5.0,i love my kindle its a great size and fits in my backpack easily i already have 10 books on it and have had to charge it since i got it keeping it on airplane mode helps it has helped me get back into reading and enjoy the books i get with primefirst it was especially great to get it on sale on prime day and i would recommend it to anyone seriously considering getting one,love it
1.0,do not purchase any kindle products read online reviews many customers have had issues with them that cannot be repaired if you do decide to purchase one be prepared to have to replace it every year shortly after warranty runs out amazon will not replace it but will sell you a new or refurbished one i have had 2 over the past 3 years both had issues that could not be fixed i will not be purchasing any more i give it a zero rating epic fail on amazons part,do not purchase any kindle products read online reviews 
5.0,i bought this kindle to replace my old keyboard kindle i especially enjoy the glarefree touch screen this kindle is small and lightweight enough to tuck in my small purse so that i can read while sitting in a waiting room i do also read on my ipad but prefer the kindle as it weighs less and is smaller it charges quickly i would definitely recommend it for an affordable venue for downloading and reading your favorite books the other positive is not having to decide where to store regular books i liked to save and reread my favorites and was quickly running out of space to store them now i dont have to worry about having to store physical books and can find and reread my favorites as often as i like on my kindle,five stars
3.0,i wrongly assumed in buying this product that it would light up making it easier to read before bed but it does not would have invested in the nook but amazons great library with amazon prime was too good to pass up makes for a good investment just dont expect anything like a tablet,would have invested in the nook but amazons great library with amazon prime was too good to pass

5.0,now that i know more about how it works i love it had a question on how just list my books and a lovely patient young lady named shevell helped me with that and got it done my next purchase other than new books is a cover and screen protectors thank you and your customer service department,i love my kindle 5th generation device
3.0,the kindle is everything amazon says it is i have an older one the one with the keys and no light its getting on nearly five years old now and im starting to experience reduced usage time because the batteries are slowly dying and there is no way to replace themi have over a hundred titles on my kindle and it is a pleasure to use i like the ability to look things up and make notesso why only three starslast week the last bookstore in town closed for lack of business people werent interested enough in paper books to keep it open paper books anachronisms of the first degree no batteries no massive storage no handy portability for more than two or three titlesand no need for anything but a pair of eyes to read themthats why my faithful kindle only gets three stars it let me be lazy and cheap and move away from books and into electronic storage and a screenthat once the batteries are down is unreadableyes its okay what it encouraged me to do wasnt yes buy one you might as well real books are going the way of dinosaursjust pray nothing damages our electronic data storage or were literally up the creek and we wont know how to make a paddle,kindle wonderful and terrible at the same time
4.0,this has been great so far i purchased the kindle for 6999 bought 6 months of kindle unlimited for 30 and i bought the charger head for 15 just the cord is included you have to buy the part the plugs into an outlet separatenegatives kindle unlimited does not include a lot of books that are popular or in demand i have a booklist of around 50 books that i would like to read and only 56 are available for free through kindle unlimited and those are the older books on my list none of the current top sellers are included so disappointed with the selection and probably will not purchase again at the end of 6 monthsthis kindle does not include a light which means that you will need to have an actual light on to read this just as if you were reading a regular book i didnt think this would bother me but it has turned in to a bit of a pain and lightening would have been nice when needed for example when taking the metro to work and the lightening isnt great when you turn the kindle off it defaults to an advertisement i know that is a small thing but i dont like being bombarded with ads 247 especially when the device is supposed to be off i purchased these items directly from my bank account and and received the kindle and charger in two days with amazon prime the info for the kingle unlimited was supposed to be sent to my via email i never received the email so on the third day after purchase i called to make sure everything was ok i spoke to a woman on the help line who said there was a delay but it was processing and that she would call me the next day to follow up with me i didnt receive a phone call back from here on the fourth day after purchase so on the fifth day i called back to follow up sidenote i was anxiously awaiting reading on my new kindle when i called back i was told that the delay was that i had paid for my purchase with a bank account and to buy the kindle unlimited you have to use a credit card so i told her to just charge it to the credit card they had on file but because this was a bundle item she couldnt do it so instead i had to go online and buy the kindle unlimited for 60 and then she refunded me the extra 30 suffice to say this was a big headache and i was on the phone sorting all this out for almost an hour it should be posted at purchase that this needs to be bought with a credit card plus side she gave me a 10 credit applied to my amazon account for future purchases you have to be the charger head seperate this left a bad taste in my mouth i have to pay 15 extra dollars to be able to charge my kindle at an outlet as opposed to just having the cord to plug into a computer i felt like this was a cheap move on amazons partalso this is literally just a device to buy and read books to my knowledge you can not access the internet to go to other websites etcpositives the kindle is directly linked to your amazon account so buying books is done with just a click of the button you can also create book lists to save for purchase later when you are reading a book on the kindle you can highlight wordspassages you can click on a word to see the definition you can click on the name of a character to get info on them if you forget who they are very helpful when reading a more complicated book and it is pretty easy to navigateyou can adjust the size of the font as neededits a good size that is large enough to be about the size of a paperback book but small enough to easily carry around it is much lighter than the more advanced more expensive kindles as welloverall i really like the kindle i think if i had to do it again i would have spent the extra money and gotten the kindle paperwhite and not gotten the kindle unlimited maybe next time,like it but wouldnt buy again
5.0,pretty amazing device page turning is fluid contrast is good very lightweightonly issue has been with getting content purchased outside the kindle store onto the reader amazon seems to have made this less easy than before which is disappointing but not deal breakingitd be nice if it had 3g,nice improvement to the kindle product line
4.0,im reallly enjoying it some problems trying to figure out everything but kindle support was excellent not sure why i cant seem to download project gutenburg books to the kindle when i can to kindle on my pc but just a minor distraction,but kindle support was excellent not sure why i cant seem to download 
1.0,new kindle not nearly as good as my old one screen on old one got cracked or i would never have changed new one very awkward to access my library turning pages more awkward and recommendations keep popping up and wont leave i basically hate the new machine and wish for my old one back the old style was good and you wrecked it,dont like new kindle
3.0,the jury is still out on this one i had the version 1 for so long i got used to flipping the pages with the side panel on this one the touch screen is so sensitive i find myself clicking two or three pages ahead each time i turn a page this is quite annoying,this is quite annoying
2.0,i dont like this kindle at all im very disappointed by the page turning its difficult to use in various situation ie when reclining sometimes it takes 234 times to get the page to change i also am disappointed i cant get scrabble and other games on this i wish my old basic kindle hadnt broken i would just say please read the reviews before you buy this,disappointing
4.0,i love this version of the kindle and the ads are not obtrusive which is nice however the only issue i had was the touch sensitivity the slightest touch of my shirt sweater sheet or blanket affects the screen either the font menu pops up the pages flip either way so you have reread to determine where you are even with its bulk its still light weight enough to be comfortable despite this minor flaw overall for the price its definitely worth it,i love this version of the kindle and the ads are

4.0,wonderful i had a backlit kindle and with the number of hours i spend in front of the computer for work and school i was getting awful headaches this kindle gives me no headaches and while commuting for work and being in graduate school it is nice to have all of my textbooks and articles in one place and to weigh so littlei would recommend however to buy the one without the adds as i have concerns about the battery life and longevity of the screen when it is constantly filled with either my book or an advertisement,buy the noadd upgrade

4.0,i accidentally stepped on my old kindle and knew i needed upgrade anyways i got this one because it was part of a deal i like that its smaller and seems sturdier than my previous kindle the touch screen is easier to work with and the layout makes it easier to view my books and collections the screen is super sensitive if i hover my finger over the screen it tends to pull something up which can be annoying at times however for the price and for what i need it works perfect,i like that its smaller and seems sturdier than my previous

5.0,i bought this for my boyfriend for christmas he is very tech savvy and wanted to upgrade his phone to get the 6 inch screen for reading at first i could tell he was scepticle but once he opened up his book on the kindle he loved it it fits in his coat pocket and is easy to take to work the screen is nice because theres no glare or light giving his eyes a rest from that bright smartphone,great product
4.0,love my new kindle i sometimes find holding a book difficult and painful and after trying my daughters kindle i thought a kindle would be helpful my daughter gave me one as an early birthday gift and im now reading a few hours everyday just like i used to do adjusting the print size is a plus and although im a bit clumsy with the touch screen im getting the hang of it the kindle is right up there with the top 5 gifts i have ever received,love my new kindle
1.0,i hate hate hate this product like other customer reviews bring back the old kindle with the buttons on the bottom and page turner buttons on the side this touchscreen is a load of crap and youre paying more just for junk and advertisements you dont need or will use to get started you are forced to sign up for kindle prime if i had wanted that i would have signed up for it but i didnt need or want it so didnt sign up for it so wasnt happy i was forced to sign up for it to just start my kindle this continuous tapping to change pages is the biggest nuisance and i have acrylic nails so it sounds like a swarm of termites on a eating binge with this continuous tapping i travel and fly a lot for my job i will now have to book my seat on the wing of the plane because with this continuous tapping to change pages it will annoy other passengers on the plane and they might throw me my kindle or both out the emergency exit i found it very difficult to navigate to get where you need to be to read what you downloaded i found the text difficult to read through all the smudges and handprints left through using a touch screen i dont even like touchscreen computers all this swiping and tapping to go back and forth you like something between an idiot and bird in flight someone could make a good music video showing how dumb you look doing all this swiping and tapping i just hate it when you get use to a good product that you really enjoyed i really liked my old basic kindle with the buttons on the bottom and buttons on the side and had it with me everywhere i went and they decide to upgrade and its a load of crap and you cant go back to the old one like others stated if you want a kindle youre stuck with these whether you like it or not and i absolutely hate it with a passion but im stuck with it because i like reading a kindle we should get a dissatisfied customer discount for having to purchase an inferior product to read a kindle,hate kindle touchscreen

5.0,nice display and resolution you dont need to get the 300 dpi upper version as your eyes cant catch the difference for books im a graphic person so take my word the upper version has night light but not a good illumunation just a few leds on the corners also its not healthy to read books in dark dont harm your eyes and grab this,perfect one in the series

3.0,theres nothing wrong with it its just small i dont think ive ever read a real book with pages as small as this if i was purchasing again id definitely buy the 75the display is ok but its not paperwhiteit also doesnt connect automatically to my wifi i noticed this because i was reading my current book on another device and when i went back to kindle it was still on the last page i had read on the kindle i had to find the menu and select sync and then reconnect to my network the kindle has not been out of the house or turned offone of its selling points is that you can read it in bright sunlight i hope thats true because you definitely cant read it in dim light it absolutely requires a well lit area to not give you eyestrain,its ok as for taking on a trip but not a great choice as a daily reader only readable in well lit environment
5.0,it is my first eink reader and it really do look feel like a paper it would have been great if there were more popular books available on kindle unlimited i have bought this reader mainly to replace my childs chapter books but wont be able to replace all the chapter books as they are not unlimited service and need to buy them for quite a price still love its dictionary and word wise feature,feel like a paper

4.0,had to replace my old original kindle and chose this unit my only downside i see is it is slipperier than the older version the older version was almost like a rubbery finish on the back making it easier to hold this one is just slick plastic i guess thats so you will buy the cover for it also it is not very glarefree when reading at the table with the overhead lights on i have to move it so the glare on the screen is lessened my old one was much better at reducing glare,several downsides

2.0,i am not sure what happened here i had a 2 year old kindle that broke weeks after my extended warranty expired so i bought this one it is easily twice the weight and bulk despite the fact touch technology has been around for over 23 years on the kindle feels like a step backwardpart of why i loved my kindle was how thin and light is was this brick feels like i will constantly be aware of its weight also size and shape not as easy to hold kind of sad,thick

4.0,great device at a great price holds charge for a long period of time and is clear to read in the light while being easy on the eyes ads do not interfere with reading and i see no need to pay extra to remove only negatives are 1 there is a slight discoloration when turned off showing a whitish streak that disappears when turned on 2 cases are confusing and the amazon website does not state the product generation within the product description nevertheless the reader has worked flawless and is simple to use,great device at a great price

3.0,i got this one after having a kindle keyboard that spontaneously shut down after years of having it im not too happy with it first it does not support audiobook files which i use for long car trips second the touch screen is annoying every time i have to turn a page ive gotta block my field of vision to touch the screen ive had it for less than a day and im already returning it,im not too happy with it
5.0,love it,five stars
3.0,it is easier to accurately change pages with the forwardbackward switches with the touch screen i sometimes turn more than 1 page and unintentional touches change pages when not intended for some reason i lost the indicators at the bottom of the page that indicated percent read and another sequence number how do i get some indicators displayed again is it possible to indicate page number or remaining time to complete book,it is easier to accurately change pages with the forwardbackward 
5.0,had a kindle before and loved it from the time it stopped working i purchased this knew one and have not regretted iti love love reading and this makes it so easy its light weight so i can hold it like a book which is fantastic i take it every where its not hard on the eyes and easy to operate so thanks amazon for another great economical device for people like me who dont have lots to spend but love to read,fantastic

3.0,i was really excited to receive this for christmas it was definitely something i wasnt expecting im a huge book fan so i love that this is in black and white and easy to hold you dont have the awkward struggle of trying to get comfy after you turn the page the only thing is i hate that theirs no option to adjust brightness my eyes suck thats the only reason im giving it three stars it was a big disappointment in my case,im a huge book fan so i love that this is in black and white
4.0,love it,the best

4.0,upgraded from the original kindle touch what i love about this unit is that it is a lot faster page turns are almost instantaneous and the kindle store loads in no time the screen is brighter and much higher res the software extras are pretty cool if you have kids or someone whos looking to beef up their english skillsthe only downsides the slide to unlock seems silly i preferred the old method of pressing the button to get to my contentalso the back was a lot better with the original touch the solid black back with angles feel less premium,great upgrade from the orginal kindle touch
5.0,love it,five stars
3.0,it has been a long time until i got my hand on the kindle for a reasonable price it has many virtues but quite a few faults as well it is very convenient to hold and read the font size is adjustable easily and the weight is great the problems begin with the unfriendly operating and pull down menus it is extremely confusing and does what it wants rather than what i ask it to do that is actually the biggest disappointment and it is so laborious that i had gave up on the device after just a few trials even my kids electronic device savvies find it really hard to navigate,the font size is adjustable easily and the weight is great
5.0,love it,five stars
5.0,i love my kindle the screen is not back lit so you do need a light to read which some might dislike however i prefer it and i feel like my eyes dont get as tired i love the selection they have and how quick fast and easy it is to get new books some people say it isnt really the same as reading a hard copy of a book but i think it is very close i chose this version of the kindle main to encourage myself to actually read rather than getting distracted with apps it is small light and fits in the hands very well,great product
5.0,an amazing product wish i got one a long time ago kind of sad that there is no separate power adapter that comes with it but other than that it came in one piece and im happy not much too say that other people havent said already 5 stars,great
5.0,just what i wanted basic ereader that is light and easy to use i really enjoy that this syncs so easily with amazon and my library i used a nook for many years and have just upgraded to the kindle due to all the great reviews i heard from my friendsi would highly suggest this if you want just the basic read and go ereader,basic ereader that is light and easy to use
4.0,i had kindle2 up until it quit working last year that was my first adventure in devices i carry this one in my purse since it is lighter than my tablet i have 5 bible translations i can read while waiting at doctor office etc the touch screen is great,light weight so it goes where i go

4.0,nice unit its easy on the eyes compared to reading on a normal tablet screen turning the page is a bit strange the screen does a quick funky pixal dance as the new page comes up you soon get used to it and dont notice it after a few pages i dont like the ads when you turn it off it displays a ad for a book so it never looks like its turned off im glad i got this reader im sure ill be reading a lot more ebooks now,i like it

5.0,it was exactly what i expected plus a little more it reads just like a book but you can hold it in one hand easily theres an experimental browser which lets you go to certain websites ive been reading a free ebook online with it sometimes the screen is a little glitchy when i scroll but its an experimental browserthat usually means its not completely perfect,it reads just like a book but you can hold it in one 
4.0,love it battery life is long glare free is awesome i dont feel like ive been staring at a light for too long also i can use my galaxy charger to charge my kindlethe only problem is it takes too long to shut down the kindle you have to press the onoff button for a long time before the shut down screen comes on maybe there is an easier way to shut it down i just havent figured it out yet,love it battery life is long

3.0,i have been using this after my 3rd generation kindle stop working and i greatly miss my old kindle there is no text to speech function which i used so often that i just use my iphone or ipad more than my new kindle touch function is nice to have but i dont see much improvement,i prefer old kindle
3.0,my biggest concern was the page colortone too dark for my eyes making it difficult to read for more than a few minutes perhaps not an issue for the younger set i did like being able to set the font nice feature as i prefer a sans serif myself wish the app did that otherwise no complaints very light to hold i may try the new lit version,returning
5.0,we had the reader with the buttons and it started to flake out on us this unit is great i love having something you can only read on i dont get side tracked by other unit that have all the bells and whistles so i am glad kindle still has this unit and hope they never do away with it, started to flake out on us this unit is great i love having something you can only read on

5.0,i bought the kindle fire first generation when it first came out this last christmas i bought this kindle reader for my teenage son he loves it it is so light and the screen is so easy to read i am planning on buying one for myself the kindle fire has a backlit screen that makes it very difficult to read books onespecially outdoors and in sunshine,the best for reading
5.0,i love my kindle it does what it promises and i think its easy to use i used to be anti ebook because i love seeingfeeling real books but for some reason im more inclined to read every night on an ereader i just keep the kindle in plain sight by my bed its easier to transport than a book and its nice to have your library on one device and be able to instantly read a new book as soon as you finish one,simple and functional
5.0,this is the first kindle i have ever owned and i just love it it is so light in the hand and the downloads are so fast now that 1000 page book wont kill my wrist to hold this was the best christmas present ever, first kindle i have ever owned and i just love it it is so light in the hand 
4.0,the only drawback i would say are the ads every time the screen times out or you put the screen in sleep mode instead of completely off this is what amazon means by with special offers in order to get rid of them you have to pay 20 more dollars which still keeps it cheaper or the same as other ereaders but i did not like the misleading descriptionother than that i love the size weight and look of this kindle this is my first ereader and i love the ability to change font sizes look up words on the spot or even highlight a character name for a quick synopsis when you cant remember where that character came from i am a huge paper book lover so still having the feel of looking at paper is a huge plus i also like that there is no backlight because i read before bed and looking at screens with a backlight right before going to bed keeps me awake,but i did not like the misleading description
5.0,the kindle i got was for my husband and is easy to use as he isnt savv when it comes to anything in the tech world he loves it the glare free screen is just that even in the florida sun great product,love the kindle 6 glare free
1.0,i was led to believe it would do one thing and it does but not well at all i am really disappointed in this kindle im still trying to decide to keep it or return it the touch screen isnt user friendly the browser is a joke unless you have all day to try to get it to connect and actually do something useful and the wifi compatibility is not up to standard i am considering returning it and purchasing something else i should have known it was too good to be true you get what you pay for no matter what they say it will do,really dissatisfied
5.0,very pleased with this basic kindle and wish i had bought one a long time ago it has exceeded my expectations on battery life already and i love that it is so light and easy to carry and easy to use i wanted something i could read like a book and this kindle is perfect for me no extras with a great price and i did not duplicate all the tablet features i already had with my tablet,basic kindle is a great value for reading
5.0,i like the product very much because it is lightweight and will be great for backpackinghowever i am very disappointed that the device is now marked down 20 more dollars a week after i purchased it and feel like you should refund some money to me or at least send a free cover,kindle 6in glarefree

5.0,i really like this device i also have a barnes and noble nook color which i find clunky heavy and slightly inconveneint there are two things i find odd one being the lack of back lighting but the text is so clear that for the most part it doesnt bother me the second is that it does not really shut off just shuts the screen off and it is difficult to monitor the battery level since the battery has a long life that isnt even very important very very happy that i took the plunge and bought it,i really like this device
4.0,i actually won this in a raffle and i absolutely love it the size is perfect to bring it with you to any place there are many fun and affordable cases out there for itonly reasons its not five star is i miss headphone jack the feature thats reads the book to you its only 4 gigs not 8 and no constant internet with or without wifi but those were all thing my old kindle keyboard had,and i absolutely love it the size is perfect to bring it 
5.0,kindle designed for its particular function as an ereader has many good points over a table or whatever elsefirst it functions wonderfully andsecondly its rugged if you drop your tablet its off to the store for a new one in its case if you drop your kindle it may loose your place but it still works greata kindle fan absolutely,designed for its particular function as an ereader has many good points over a table or whatever else
3.0,usually i use kindle reader on my ipad it doesnt work well in bright light and i wanted something else that i could use under those conditions in that respect this kindle serves its purpose but it is a little more basic than i thought it would be,usually i use kindle reader on my ipad 
5.0,love this kindle i owned one of the oldest models with the buttons on the side but wanted something new it took me a minute to get use to the touch screen but i love everything about this kindle very easy to navigate and search for books highly recommend for the price,love this kindle
4.0,the device is easy to navigate and easy to read however it like all 4 kindles i own has a tendency to freeze occasionally for no apparent reason i have yet to have any communication from amazon about this problem improve your hardware people also it is very tedious to shop in the kindle store as one must go sequentially through the listings as one who buys 15 to 20 books per month i would like some way other than listing a specific author to be able to go further in the list without simply turning page after page after page,the device is easy to navigate and easy to read
4.0,love my kindle it works wonders exactly what i wanted it for reading i dont mind that it doesnt have the back led lights i got it for day reading and its perfect the interface is smooth and straight forward the tutorial at the beginning is very clear the only reason it gets four stars is the page turn tends to be a bit off sometimes other than that amazing,love my kindle
4.0,just what i was looking for i have used many reading apps on my phone however i can get distracted by texts and emails coming in with the kindle i can leave my phone in a different room and let the book absorb me inthis version does support pdfs however the screen is small which makes for a difficult time in reading some pdfs otherwise works quite quickly,just what i needed
4.0,love the look and readability of the screen great to use for trips can read several books and takes very little space battery seems to last a really long time only downfalls had to buy reading light for reading at night friend had an older version kindle and had some games loaded solitaire sudoku and battleship i havent been able to get any loaded on mine,compact and battery lasts a long time
5.0,i gave this same kindle to my boyfriend 3 years ago and he still reads constantly when a friend gave me my own i was thrilled but now i cant put in words how it has changed my life no more searching for something to watch on tv i read constantly have read 8 books in one week was worried about being able to see the script but being able to change the font size has solved that problem im taking advantage of the free book trial too,cant imagine life without it

4.0,since this is my first kindle i like how easy it was to understand and navigate i dont do computers very much only downside was that there is no back light so have to have lamp or other light source in order to read battery charge last very long time about a week before i have to recharge it i would recommend this one for beginners,since this is my first kindle i like how easy it was to understand and navigate
5.0,if you just want a simple ebook reader its a great toy to have the screen is like looking at a glare free chess mat you can look at it for hours i bought it to get back to the basics and dial back from my internet time my coworker tells me amazon has a better selection then barns and noble with their nook,i love it
5.0,ive been a kindle 3 keyboard user for two years the kindle touchscreen is great ease of use once i read the included on board manual the only thing i like better on the kindle 3 is the display of the contents,kindle touchscreen is great
4.0,having the free time with all those books at my fingertips is great and having achievements to unlock is motivating it is dark and i dont see a way to brighten it sometimes it is difficult to do the vocabulary or get back to the home screen also if you dont get the achievement try going back with the book and seeing if you looked at the cover,does the job
5.0,i wanted a plain and simple ereader because all i needed was to read books this is perfect compact clear easy to navigate and affordable it doesnt have a bunch of fancy features so as long as youre not looking for that this is a good pick,this is perfect compact
5.0,its smaller than my last kindle but for the price its wonderful so many new features to it than my old kindle which id had for four years didnt have love it and would recommend it as its lightweight and travels very easy,its wonderful so many new features to it than my 
4.0,if there was a place for headphones so we could enjoy audible it would have gotten five stars this is my second kindle i also use the kindle app on my ipad which is why i chose not to get the paperwhite this is fast the battery lasts enjoying very much, there was a place for headphones so we could enjoy audible it would have gotten five stars
3.0,the device is find for an adult i bought it for my 8 year old for christmas it was not clear exactly how to set it up and ad it to my account it took almost an hour on the phone to get that done the web page on amazon advertising this says you can get the unlimited starting at 299 i called amazon prior to purchasing it to find out exactly what you get for 299 per month i was told that with my 100yr prime membership plus the 299mo that my son would be able to read for no additional charge anything marked kindle unlimited that is not true you get a very small set of books most of which are too basicyoung for an 8 year old for 299month to get just some of the books he wants you need the full 999mo subscription which is fine but that is not what i was told before i bought it books dont consistently show up on it either some showed up on my sons kindle some of my sons books showed up on mine additionally the free time application is not very intuitive it was hard to figure out how to get books into it or the device out of free time mode,great for an adult not so good for a parent buying for a child
3.0,i have a paper white 7 inch it is second generation and i love it this touch screen is a little difficult to use unlike the ipad this screen does not turn the pages as easily hope this helps to improve this product,it is second generation and i love it this touch screen is a little difficult 
5.0,i love my kindle i am to a book reader but am becoming one now it is so convenient and compact so i carry it everywhere i can see the words fine without the light as long as the room is lit the pages turn easily and it is user friendly,i love my kindle

4.0,got this for my daughter who is 11 she has an ipad for school and loves to get library books on it to read we dont like her reading from it at night so got her this she had been using mine but we often wanted to read at the same time we were both sad to find that you cant get some of the free kindle games that we love to play as a family on it like every word and dots and boxes they are not available for this 7th generation they are great little word or strategy games not sure why they are not available other than that she loves it just a tiny bit disappointed,almost great
5.0,really enjoying my new kindle reading the users guide has taken a while because theres a lot to absorb but at least i can always check back when ive got a questionfor years ive used kindle apps on tablets and kindle cloud on the chrome browser so i know already how much i like reading ebooks but i like having an actual kindle because of the super amount of reading time on a single charge especially when compared to a tablet,hours of reading on a single charge
4.0,im writting this review because i really like kindle but i think that it has some good and bad points as to the good points it is light weighted easy to take to places has a high memory capacity it makes it easier to carry a lot of books at the same time as to the bad points for me the worse thing is that kindle doesnt have an option where you can invert the lights so when you are in a dark place you cant read i understand that it is supposed to be like an actual book but as a customer if i am choosing to buy an eletronic book rather than an actual book it is because i want more reading options but i really recommend this product,kindle the best choice
5.0,compact hardy and easy to use battery hasnt been charged since i got it over a week ago and still doesnt need to be i read 23 hours a day when possible and boy is this awesome since i got it for 49 bucks i dont have to be super careful with it either i just treat it like a book,affordable ereader
4.0,i love the feel and look of the kindle and if you can make reading on a screen any closer to reading an actual book this is it which leads to my only complaint there is no backlight one of the main reasons i would choose a device over a book is to be able to read in lowlight which you cannot do with this kindle i received this as a gift so will keep it and use it though sadly not as often as id like,good intro to an ereader but no night owls
5.0,having upgraded from a 2nd gen kindle i love the smaller size and the fact that it is so lightweight i can easily carry it in my purse and take my books everywhere i also like that its touchscreen like my other devices ipad iphone etc cant tell you how many times i have switched from reading on my ipad to my old kindle tried to swipe the page and thought for a second it was broken because it wasnt responding 😆 the battery life is good and the glarefree display is easy on the eyes,love my kindle 7th gen
5.0,for what this is intended to be it deserves five stars it is the perfect inexpensive starter book reader thin easy to use compact longlasting battery charge and adjustable sized fonts there is no brightness adjustment and you need an external light source to read after dark the newer ones have 4gb of storage i soon realized i wanted a few more features and upgraged to the paperwhite model which does have the brightness adjustment and internal lighting both models come with the same usb charging cable you can plug them into your computer or many standard phone chargers work just fine as does my ipad charger using the kindle usb cable,basic book reader just the essentials
4.0,a good reader the only reason i give it four out of five is im not over fond of touchscreens i liked the buttons on the old style better thats just personal preference with no reflection on how the device works,a good reader the only reason i give it four 
5.0,cant complainproduct is exactly as described it is very lightweight easy to read is pretty fast when downloading books off of wifi i would recommend this to any avid reader i would add though if you want to read in a darker setting then you should go with a backlit kindle,easy to read
5.0,this is my 3rd or maybe 4th kindle and this is the best so far having the buttons back for page turning is a huge plus tapping the screen was ok but i like being able to leave my thumb resting on the button then just pressing for a page turn reminds me of the early generations which i liked for that reason i also think the power button placement is better on the backthe only thing i wish for is the ability to assign the left big page turn button to be page back instead of page forward, 3rd or maybe 4th kindle and this is the best so far

3.0,i have owned many kindles i have the app on my phone and 2 tablets i read daily for hours so l know how to navigate a kindle this kindle is constantly changing my font size sometimes as many as 10 times in an hour very irratating but i only have this problem with this device all my others my husband and daughters kindles are awesome along with my the apps on other devices,kindles are awesome
5.0,i have resisted buying any distracting portable technology but im glad i bought my kindle it is easy to use convenient to carry and a great way to pass time while waiting in airports or in restaurants also i enjoy that i can carry all my favorite books in one small package,a great convenience
5.0,i got one each for my 10 and 6 year old girls for christmas and one for myself truly one of the best christmas presents ive given us love it this is our first reading device so i cant make a comparison to any other product but i can tell you were enjoying ours very much,truly one of the best christmas presents ive given us
2.0,this was a replacement for my 6 eink previous generation 5th buttoned kindle and i must say that i am very upset with how much heavier about 15 and bulkier it is from that one i wouldve gotten that exact one had it still been available the design of this new one is uglier too my old one had nice rounded edges while this one has squared edges and looks like a thin brick add to the situation that it arrived a day late and this its a bad experience all around i do not recommend it if youre upgrading from the 5th generation buttoned kindle though new users obviously wont notice a difference,5th generation buttoned kindle was better
4.0,i have had this kindle for one wee it is ok but im still missing my old keyboard one with the reading light available via the purchased cover but i do enjoy this one being for reading only i also miss the availability of the book description link,adjusting to the new
3.0,while i am absolutely obsessed with kindle i got the first generation and have had one ever since i dislike the touchscreen i have stocked up on several of the fifth generation kindles with the buttons and am dreading the day that i have to get the touchscreen many of the improvements that amazon has made have been awesome ie the fact that the new ones have a builtin light i do wish they would continue to offer a nontouch screen version however as i think it is both easier to use more intuitive and has faster pageturning ability,bring back the buttons
5.0,i love my new kindle 6 inch reader a lot the only problem for me is that its not lit up im used to my kindle fire 7in and my fire hdx 89 in that are both lit i am going to order a reading light to attach to my new reader so that will solve my problem,i love my new kindle 6 inch reader a lot
5.0,i have put of buying one of these for a long time that was a mistake its light thin battery last a long time and easy to readyou can adjust the font size its great for travel and a book loads in seconds and they are not expensive i really thought i would miss a paper book i dont,its light thin battery last a long time and easy to read
1.0,unfortunately ive not been able to read pass one chapter with this kindle ereader the pages do not change when touching and the device keeps getting stuck then turns off this is the most frustrating thing since i am an avid reader am completely stumped with this one guess ill have to spend more money on a better reader not a happy customer ,guess ill have to spend more money on a better reader not a happy customer
4.0,good product was a gift and im very happy with itits back lit but i like that it really does read like paper and the instant link to wikipedia is niceit has limited but useful internet browsing but its tricky to find at firstonce you figure out how to navigate this thing its quite handy,good product was a gift and im very happy

2.0,i really tried to like this product as i have wanted a kindle for a long time however the screen darkness even in brightly lit rooms or outside made it difficult to read amazon shows multiple images of this device with a white screen however this device doesnt actually have a white screenreturned,actual screen doesnt match amazons web images for device

1.0,kindle arrived but software is not working properly i cant open the start menu once i have opened a book so its impossible to return to home screen i have to open the dictionary abd from there go to home i tried reading the manual but it wasnt very helpful because it referred to butttons that the device doesnt have i imagine this device has the wrong software i will contact amazon to see if they can fix this,software error
4.0,proslight fast text is easy to readconsi have an old keyboard kindle with a lot of content and collections the collections do not show up in the cloud along with the content that is on the old kindle the collections do show up in the cloud but only if you are trying to put something into or take something out of a collection also i can find no way to bring down the collections from the cloud i would like to have the collections on both kindles oh well,text is easy to read
4.0,this is my 6th kindle purchase including the replacements for two that were left in airports i am pleased with this one but would have off one more week had i known a new with back lighting was being released so soon,i am pleased with this one but would have off one more 
5.0,i love my kindle firehadnt seen one until a lady had one in the er and she showed me how it workedsold meit was packaged nicely so it wouldnt get damaged in transit thank you amazon,love it
4.0,its a little bit touchy sensitive and can accidentally change text size or highlight a word without trying but for the most part its been great small light weight and long battery life i would recommend,pretty good product
1.0,this is my 4th kindle and i consider this tablet to be a piece of junk it freezes up a lot and the touch screen is unpredictable one time you tap the screen to change the page and the next time you have to push hard all over the screen to turn page sometimes you touch to turn page and fonts show up and automatically changes the font size on its own from watching the battery icon discharge i dont see how it would last for weeks i read 1hr per day and turn off wifi and the battery still seems to be discharging too much the kindle that i have is very aggravating at times,not worth the aggravation
5.0,i love this product i was a hardcore nook fan but my nookglow light after time started ripping and the back light started to show through i bought my kindle paper white 5 months ago and we have been inseparable ever since amazing product its so light and so simple to use can take my entire library everywhere will shout my love of this product from the roof tops and praise it to anyone who will listen to my rants,buy it use it read it
5.0,this was a christmas gift from my daughter and i love it my wife has had a bn nook for several years now and i was getting tired of borrowing it to read things now we have the best of both worlds the kindle gives the feel of holding a paperback sized book with out the weight and thickness that some thick paperbacks have,lightweight book reading

4.0,i really like the kindle i would have liked the white version however this was a gift and am thrilled to have gotten it i find myself picking it up more often than i have any of the books ive bought i love taking it to my appointments usually there is a wait and it is so much better to have than those magazines ive wanted one for a long time just never took the plunge i do miss the light that would able me to read in bed hopefully i can still purchase one that i can attach to it i did get a cover i do like the borrowing from the amazon library with no time limiti was able to get on the ohio digital library also so far its been great,i really like the kindle

5.0,update 121015 now that ive ready about a dozen books on my kindle with no software glitches whatsoever i must assume that the initial problems i dealt with were resolved by one of the automatic updates all the features have been working perfectly for the past 4 months and i now appreciate the kindle even more than my nook thus i must update my review to 5star since thats exactly how the kindle has been working for me its virtually transparent when engrossed in a novel but quick and responsive whenever you need to look up a word find an explanation on wikipedia or highlight text excellent productupdate 81115 after initially posting a 2star review see below based on my serious frustration due to having to reboot the device about one out of every three times i attempted to use the dictionary lookup or highlight features while reading i have decided that when it does work properly its a fabulous reading device i do actually like the way it functions slightly better than my nook and its quite a bit more responsive as it should be compared to a 5yearold product overall its a well designed piece of hardware and if it werent for the fact that i cringe a little bit every time i try to look up or highlight something i would be giving it a 5star rating as this is an operating system issue it can be easily resolved so i will give amazon the benefit of the doubt on this one and hope that it gets resolve with the next firmware release until then i maintain that my 1st generation nook still works more reliablythis thing works sort of compared to my first generation nook its complete garbage on my nook i could actually use the highlights and dictionary lookup features with this piece of crap if you try to use any of those features it just freezes up so you have no choice but to reboot it the hardware is fine hence 2 stars instead of one but the firmwaresoftware is ridiculously buggy for what i would consider to be an established product seriously amazon crap like this should have been eliminated my now why does my 1st generation nook work better anyhow if you do choose to purchase this just dont try to do anything with it other than turn the pages,initally too buggy for such an established product but working great now
3.0,i ordered this kindle with excitement and found it really useful and convenient when i see it for the first time i wanted to give five stars comment but unfortunately i found that there is a small area that is not as smooth as it supposed to be on the screen its hard to find but once you find it you can never stand it due to the departure for me i can not ask for a replacement but i want to remind people to be careful with the screen anyway i believe the product is wonderful if its in a perfect condition, ordered this kindle with excitement and found it really useful and convenient when i see it for the first 
5.0,excellent ereader simple to use easy to understand light weight fits in purse so you can take with you any where my o my complaint is the pictures off your books on the home page should be larger,excellent
4.0,i still have the older kindle wouldnt be without one but im saving for a paperwhite mostly because of the lighted lit background my only beef with kindle is that even the newest versions have this problem notice that when you adjust font size there is a sudden jump about in the middle of the line of selections thats exactly where id love to have my font size wah hello amazon rders are you paying attention,a giant crevasse
5.0,i really enjoy my kindleit was a gift snd didnt realize how much i would use it as i am an avid reader and like the feel of the older books and flipping the pages etcthe kindle also has so many great features like the vocsbulary notesbookmarks,didnt think i would enjoy my kindle so much but its great
5.0,i personally love the kindle paperwhite its got a smooth sleek feel to it and the touchscreen display is welldesigned i am able to read clearly on this kindle product and it even lights up a bit when the room is a bit dim ive never had any problems reading books using the kindle in fact before i received the paperwhite i wasnt much of a reader now since it carries a huge library of books as well as the kindle unlimited service that amazon offers it is so easy to pick up your kindle and start reading right awayi forgot to mention that this has been my most used electronic product to date,the kindle paperwhite is a wonderful product
5.0,i love this reader so much i take it in my purse everywhere this is the best thing i have ever bought for myself do a lot of reading i drive a truck and have a lot of down time loading and unloading so this helps to keep my sanity,i love this reader so much
5.0,i love the new kindle e reader that i purchased i am still learning how to use some sections of it and havent shared any books yet but just using this when i read is so much nicer than actually holding a book i love that it holds my place when it is laid down and that it shows me how long i have left to finish the book at the speed i am reading however the one draw back i am finding is that glare free is a myth nothing about this is glare free,i love the new kindle e reader that i purchased

4.0,i really love this kindle the only reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because sometimes it will jump a few pages ahead randomely and i have to find which page im on its possible that its because of the case i have on it but i havent figured it out yet,i really love this kindle
5.0,awesome,five stars
5.0,i love my kindle paper white i can read it outside without a glare the only thing that would make it any better would be a feature to turn on a back lit screen that would allow me to read it inside as well as outside love my kindle,love my kindle paper white
5.0,love it,five stars
4.0,i would recommend this kindle its fun and easy to usemy reason for 4 stars and not 5 is it would be nice if you could see it in the dark to read other then that its great and im very happy i purchased two,great product
4.0,i over all really like this kindle what do not like is every time i accidently touch the page something happens like to find size changes or the menu pops up or i accidently turn the page i miss my old kindle i do like that is books to the wifi faster and the kindle store is way easier to navigate,really like this kindle
4.0,while my new kindle 6 glarefree touchscreen has a few new features love being able to adjust size of letters as then dont need my glasses my biggest complaint is i dont like touching the screen to turn page it is way too easy to accidentally touch screen and change page when carrying from one room to another much prefer the older way by clicking on side of case far less oops only complaint with old model was keyboard at bottom seldom used itdid get a new cover as old ones dont fit quite a shame as old one i used for years was easier to open and it had a secure anchor on sidewould i recommend this to others yes but would be a yes to my old model,love being able to adjust size of letters as then 
5.0,regarding page turning there are times when touch page turning does not work and at those times i wish for the positive action of the buttons i have found that this happens when i am reading while thekindle is plugged in and charging perhaps this has happened also to those who miss the buttons that their old kindle had,cant live without a kindle
5.0,this is my first kindle and i absolutely love it i was very wary of trying an ereader of any kind but finally decided to give it a try after learning about some interesting benefits to reading on a kindle vs a traditional good ol book i was very surprised that i ended up loving it and wishing i had bought one sooner if youre on the fence about ereaders at all you should definitely just take the plunge and make the purchaseyou will not be sorry,in love
5.0,i am so excited that i finally purchased myself a kindle ive been holding off far too long i love how easy it is for me to download a book and i love the kindle unlimited subscription works perfectly for my lifestyle since i live out of a camper i love books however the space is limited kindle is my hero,i love how easy it is for me to download a 
5.0,it is a great reader so easy to use and very light it does not hurt your eyes like other readerstablet you’ll need a cover to have a better hold and the only drawback is that you need light lamp at night,it is a great reader so easy to use and very lithe

4.0,it is everything i expected it to believei am very satisfied with iti knew that it did not have an internal lightwhich would be nicebut manage without it nicelygreat pickup for the price,i am very satisfied with it
5.0,perfect,five stars
5.0,i went for the kindle without a light as i decided a clip on light was cheaper than the difference in price between thus and the paperwhite after a couple updates it prompted me if i wanted to use the custom font bookerly i will be ordering a second kindle as my daughter who is visually impaired loved that any book could become giant print,love it
4.0,this is my first kindle and though i havent used it as much as i plan to it is a very nice device i thought i might have missed out by not getting the paperwhite but the glarefree screen works great and the lack of back lighting is not a problem, much as i plan to it is a very nice device i thought i might have missed out 
5.0,works just as described only thing i would say is if you were wanting to read your comics in color not going to happen youll need the kindle with the color screen but if you dont mind that then look no further this is the one for you,amazing for books not for colorful comics
5.0,as always a great product this one went to my son so when he was in trouble he could still access his books i was going for very basic for that reason and this is just right love that it went on sale 3 days after i bought mine but amazon was again great and refunded the difference,as always great product
5.0,i enjoyed it so much i bought my daughter one for christmas the original one that i received 5 years ago is going to be passed down to her daughter it is light weight easy to hold as i have arthritis which makes it painful to hold a book,i enjoyed it so much
5.0,purchased this for my son who loves to read thought i would give it a shot since the house is crowding with books and taking up too much space he loves it the display is great and perfect for reading and he can just download the books and not have to worry about storing them later great investment for someone who loves reading,great purchase
5.0,i got this for christmas and i love it i used to have an older version so i didnt have the touchscreen feature it might take a little while to get completely used to it but it proves easy and selfexplanatory my kindle is small enough to fit in your purse while being big enough to read easily i really enjoy the seamless flipping between pages and handy menu at the top of the screen as opposed to a menu button and arrow keys when my old kindle was working i had almost the entire anne of green gables collection and was sad when i lost it since my books were in the cloud i now have the whole set back and cant wait to read them again,i love my kindle 
5.0,i love my kindle i am an avid reader but have developed cataracts had to give up reading went to large print books but they are so heavy finally decided to try a kindle it is fantastic i read all the time again my complaint is i went with the 30 day free trial of kindle unlimited which then was to switch to 999 month until i stopped it well discovered today that they just took 99 out of my account for amazon premium or whatever it is called and i cant find anyway to get ahold of amazon to straighten this out is this a rip off or what i do not want their premium service since all i am interested in is ebooks im giving the kindle a 5 star rating but not the premium service still would like the kindle unlimited,i love my kindle

5.0,bought the reader to take advantage of kindle unlimitedvery happy with my decision both the reader and the program live up to expectationsease of use long battery charge variety of books available cost effective i highly recommend,good deal
4.0,i really like my new kindle i recieved it as a birthday present from my children one of the things i do not like that it did not come with an instruction manual the online manual is not real user friendly probably the biggest disappointment with it is that it is not back lit or have a light for reading in dark places or at night i had borrowed my daughters and really liked it and that it is why they bought me this one her kindle had a light to it which worked great for reading at night so i figured my new kindle would also,i really like my new kindle
4.0,it is ok the print for your selections is very small you can make the actual print for the book reading larger which is great i had wanted the paper white version but there was a misunderstanding and they got me this one so far i am still learning all the things it can do eventually i will have it where i want it to be,kindle ereader 6 glarefree
3.0,i didnt know what to expect with the kindle i enjoy the ease of downloading several books to have on hand without actually carrying several books with me i have some trouble with the glarefree screen so far it is great with carrying a charge and it is very lightweight,i enjoy the ease of downloading several books to have on 
3.0,i am simply loving this my kindle 6 glarefree touchscreen display ereader the size is easy to handle and the no nonsense reading is appreciated downloading books are a cinch i know i will enjoy this for years to come,the size is easy to handle and the no nonsense reading is appreciated
4.0,i havent used it as yet but i do like the size for holding light and easy to hold i am frustrated that the charging unit sent with the unit can only be charged through a computer i dont like the fact that you have an additional cost for an outlet charging unit,but i do like the size for holding
1.0,extremely disappointed both with the device and support it is completely nonfunctional i received kindle 7th generation less than a year ago however it was purchased 1 year and 2 weeks ago so is no longer covered under warranty barely used it and it has been handled with care amazon offered that if i sent back the device they would give me less than 500 credit toward the purchase of a new kindlescreen locked up went through all the online steps to troubleshoot then after almost an hour on the phone with very long silences on the other end it could not be pinged and they had no other suggestions have had a sony ereader for nearly 10 years and it works perfectly so will go back to using it,extremely disappointed both with the device and support
1.0,this kindle and apparently the paperwhite are designed so that when you are in landscape mode you cant use a case with a stand the words are upside down this is a design flaw that amazon is not willing to fix this is my 4th and last kindle,this kindle and apparently the paperwhite are designed so that

5.0,it was just as i expected i have owned the original kindle with keyboard for several years i was very happy with the original kindle and am also very happy with this new kindle i like the smaller size and quicker wifi,i was very happy with the original kindle and am also very happy 
4.0,my only complaint is that i have a hard time getting to where i want on this device i tried downloading from overdrive to get a book from the library and i couldnt find were it had downloaded other than that it is easy to read from and very light the price was right also i still cant figure out where the library books are downloading though,a good price for this device
3.0,ive had it about a month now i purchased it to reduce eyestrain from reading a tablet nexus 7 or smartphone samsung s5 but im not quite sure about that battery life is great 2 weeks on all the time before my first charge,not too bad
5.0,i got this a couple weeks ago and it has been working awesomeley so far i am considering getting a protective case because the plastic on the kindle scratches really easily i really like how you can buy a book on the kindle or on your computer and it downloads in seconds i am very satisfied with this purchase so far,fun and easy to use
5.0,this thing is awesome much quicker and more responsive than my kindle keyboard and also half the cost of what that 3rd generation kindle costed me new years agohowever the screen is touchy if you have shaky hands then this might not be for youthe back plastic does feel cheaper but then the kindle is cheaper put it in a cover and you would never know the difference,for the price unbeatable
5.0,easy to use with more options than the previous versions tactile screen that does not allow traces good weight and size to the tact he feels strong bad capacity does not possess for audio books,it keeps on improving kindle
5.0,i love having my kindle i thought i would read too fast for it to keep up but with the touch screen instead of the buttons this is great if i were reading many magazines i would probably want the color versioni like the smaller size over my ipadfits in my purse easily,great christmas gift
5.0,i love this kindle i have the kindle fire tablet but its a little heavy to carry around this one is lighter and i can take my books with me wherever i go this has all the versatility of the tablet highlightingnotes etc without the weightgreat reader,a great reader
3.0,not having a phone that has swipe capability i have had some trouble learning how to navigate on the touchscreen display i am sure as i continue to use the touchscreen kindle it will become easier i like the to have the ability to transfer material from my old kindle to the newer one to give me access in several different places at one time,i like the to have the ability to transfer material from

1.0,i loved my old kindle so i decided to buy a new one i am really excited to get it i have amazon prime so my package should take two day excluding sundays i ordered this on 1227 and was expecting it today 1231 well it is not here and i will not be receiving it until 12 because ups does not deliver on new years day you dropped the ball on this one amazon maybe if you would have shipped it monday instead of yesterday it would have arrived on time also this is not first time this has happened,with amazon prime it would be nice to receive it on time
1.0,what happened to whispernet i have the previous kindle and not that it needs replacement though ive had it for about 5 years but i wanted to have the touch ive been researching in the hopes of finding theres a whipernet available version but it doesnt seem to be the case i will never get rid of my current 5 yr old kindle,bye bye whispernet 
2.0,this is mostly my fault i imagine i want to get started but i find the directions on how to start confusing right now im stuck on being connected with wifi my kindle was a gift i am an older user 85 and often find electronic mechanisms more difficult to operate than younger persons seem to do,my difficulties
1.0,no matter what the advertisements say the only advantage for ebooks is convenience otherwise the longed for process of getting a book opening it reading the blurbs on the covers reading across pages jumping from page 9 to 153 and back is just not available i would not consider using an ebook even for school texts i cant underline or comment on the side i am not a luddite i am curious and accepting of progress but ebooks is not it because there is so much more to books than convenience,this is progress or is it
1.0,seems difficult to use no instructions providedyou must have some kind of knowledge  i sure can not figure how to useguess it saves money to not have instructions in the box need to go online to chat with someone everytime you have a question,no instructions provided
5.0,just two wordslove it its a little different than my nook in that it doesnt show the page number on all books although the book im now reading does show the numbers i dont know if i accidentally turned this feature on or if its the formatting i did read that it depends on how the book is formatted for ereaders some books will show the actual page and some wontanother feature i really like is how fast a selected book is downloaded to the kindle you no sooner make a selection and its there,kindle 6 glarefree touchscreen display
3.0,ive been using the ipad kindle app for most of my reading but wanted something smaller and more durable for the beach so far the kindle is easy to navigate and much lighter than the ipad however my biggest gripe is that the page turning is not as seamless as on the ipad the text blurs and then the new text appears which causes a brief delay by contrast the ipad has a clean sweep to the next page but for the price its a good investment,the kindle is easy to navigate and much lighter than the ipad
1.0,i have three of the original kindles and over 2000 kindle books the first kindle i purchased would no longer charge so i decided i needed a new one to replace it as you have figured out i love my kindle i purchased this kindle i hate this kindle the carousel is not on this version it takes forever for me this look through my collection to find a book everything about the display is different and harder to navigate the actual reading screen is smaller than my original kindles i put this kindle back in the box to save in case all my other kindles died and it was my only option i then started purchasing the best grade of refurbished 3g keyboard kindles for back ups while that is an option that style has over 42000 favorable reviews why doesnt amazon just continue to offer that kindle as part of the inventory i prefer tried and true over new and improved 42 thousand people cant all be wrong,hate this kindle
5.0,having been a kindle fire user for the past 3 years i wasnt sure how id like this smaller one i love it my main problem with the kindle fire was the limited battery life the glarefree touchscreen battery lasts a long time i use the kindle fire for movies etc and the glare free for reading excellent combination,surperb reader
4.0,this is a great device its lightweight and the battery seems to last forever it feels a little cheaper than the previous touch version which came with speakers and a headphone jack but who really listens to music or audio books on their kindle these days,this is a great device its lightweight and the battery seems to 
5.0,i received this as a gift along with a protective cover love it i use it everyday the best part is that i can read outside in the sunlight or at night in the dark and both are just as pleasant to my eyes also love how i can research words as i read using the dictionary andor the wikipedia features highlighting helps me find specific passages and see what other people chose significant enough to highlight,if i could take 1 item with me to a desert island
1.0,the touch screen does not work very well when it does the screen will jump one or two pagesturning on the pad can be a problem sometimes it will go to the main page and i will have to siftthrough several motions before i can get to my page i am disappointed in my purchase,i am disappointed in my purchase
5.0,i bought this on sale and it is definitely worth the price it has exactly what i wanted for my first ereader it does not have a light but i am not bothered because i knew what i was buying in my opinion paying more for the paperwhite is not worth it just for the light this is the same software but much cheaper,love it
5.0,great product ive always wanted a kindle and now that i have one i find that i cant put it down my only concern is that the battery life doesnt really last two weeks for avid readers like me but its still longer than most tablets and the lack of games makes it easier to concentrate on my reading if i were to add something though it would probably be an audio jack and mp3 capability id like to listen to music or audiobooks as well,great
4.0,i bought this to have as a second kindle because of the price 5999 special im used to my kindle paper white so this one had a much cheaper plastic feel to it outside of that it has great print for reading in lighted places and with most of the bells and whistles as a kindle paper white less the light,good purchase
5.0,awesome,five stars
4.0,this is my third kindle i have been able to play different games on previous kindles none of the previous games that i have purchased will load on the new kindle nor can i find any new games that are available purchase is the newest kindle not compatible for games such as solitaire,this is my third kindle i have been able 
4.0,perfect size for taking anywhere,four stars
1.0,i ordered this to replace a kindle that i had left on a plane and i was a little surprised to find the back cover on this version of the device is hard plastic being that this is a product that by design is held in your hands when its being used its a jarring change from the previous models,hard plastic back needs to go
1.0,i rate this a forget it i use a kindle primarily because i have poor eye sight and can enlarge the print for reading this enlarged the book print but i could not read any of the cover information and could not tell what books i had on my carosel the small hand size was also ackward to hold i am returning this product,i use a kindle primarily because i have poor eye sight and can enlarge the print for reading
1.0,upgraded to the hd7 with the agreement to return this when i went online to return this said too late took forever for these to actually arrivehd7 is fine but now i have this collecting dustalso bought the paperwhite kindle all these were gifts for othersoffered to give this away free and the person turned it down after looking at it and said they will buy their own hd or paperwhite,cant give this away for free
1.0,this kindle is the most infuriating thing ive ever owned and it is my 3rd kindle i loved the first 2 kindles this machine is the devil incarnate first there is the touch screen which is strange enough to learn but okay i can manage it then there are the constant ads beware even after i paid the additional 20 dollars to take the ads away i still have ads constantly and suggestions that take up half my screen so basically i paid 80 bucks for ads all day all night never ending ads i am ready to toss it or return it but then how do i read my books awful awful awful if i could put fewer stars i wouldupdate i am not changing this review i have changed my kindle so that it has fewer ads on it but there are still ads i have been through hours of tutorials and online discussion groups i needed this and the upshot is i want to read my books so i am living with the ads yes i found the place where you can turn the ads off but only some ads there are still recommendations and the off screen is not james joyce or emily dickinson no its a dyson ad for a vacuum,unbelievably awful ad machine i paid money for this

5.0,i have been very hesitant to move to an ereader rather than physical books but i have been thoroughly enjoying this kindle the ease of use and convenience of being able to shop for a book whenever i like and then immediately have access to it easily makes this a worthwhile purchase not to mention carrying it in my jacket pocket means i have a small library wherever i go,a good introduction to electronic books
4.0,i have problems connecting my imac to my kindle if i try to move files between the imac and kindle will not let him do this because it does not recognize the device and the kindles software that i installed on my imac does nothingbut otherwise the kindle is fun and easy to use and i like it very much,very good but it dont talk to my imac
5.0,this was a gift from my daughter clearly she gave a lot of thought into picking out a reader that i would enjoy the glarefree touchscreen is just what i needed i get headaches because once i start reading i cant stop the glarefree screen is easy on the eyes and i havent had any headaches,clearly she gave a lot of thought into picking out a reader that i would enjoy the glarefree touchscreen is just what i needed

4.0,easy to use i debated between this and the paperwhite i read the most in bed so now i am wishing i had purchased the back lit paperwhite im sure i will find a case for this one which has a light included or a separate light that will actually fit into the case,easy to use
4.0,i purchased the 6 kindle for my daughter to encourage her reading i am please to say not only does she love her new kindle but now she loves to read she espically finds the dictionary helpful before when she was reading and would be confused by a new word she would substitute a word she knew that she tought might mean the same thing now when she comes upon a new word she simply taps it and up comes a definanition and usage example simply brilliant ,four stars
5.0,i have had a kindle for 5 years the original kindle and the screen just quit i am quite happy with my new kindle although it is taking some getting used to as it is all touch screen and i am used to buttons but not that difficult to adapt as my smartphone is touch screen the one potential issue is the shell is very slippery and i am concerned it will drop easily my next purchase will be a case for sure,meets all my needsexpectations
2.0,i liked the first kindle it was new and while some of the functions were clumsy i wanted a booknot a computer it died and amazon was very good about sending me a new one and even managed to put all my books on it that had been on the old one i missed the hard keyboard i liked the thin size i loved that the page advance was on each side so i could move forward with either hand i really liked how long it lasted without needed a rechargeit too died and amazon sent me this gradual deterioration of a product thicker smaller screen and now its a touch screen which is awkward and not helpful someone is captivated by graphics when all i want is a simple listing of books functions that used to take three clicks now take sevenused electricity at a much higher rate and no wonder all those graphics i dont want amazon seems no longer able to replace the books on the old machine and can only come up with canned responsesthe product advertising is so bad i didnt know i was ordering a touch screen i didnt want a touch screen and now that i have used this for several weeks i like it less rather than more the more i use it yecch,i liked the first kindle it was new and while

4.0,this was a replacement for my six year old kindle that had started to slow and have a few glitches the display is very clear and easy to read the only feature was the inability to plug a reading light directly into the kindle to use it for power and have it auto shutoff with the kindle as my old one had,the display is very clear and easy to read
5.0,i have really enjoyed using this new kindle we had purchased one of the 1st or 2nd generation kindles several years ago and was ready for a upgrade that one still works well so i already had confidence in the line of products just wanted something smaller compared to our previous version this one is smaller lighter and easier to hold i love the touch screen feature and the ease of turning pages highlighting saving a place etc we are very pleased with the product,great decision to upgrade

5.0,left my 1st generation kindle on the train and had to buy the new one hated to part with the money but at least this is a much improved device like its earlier versions it does what it should but the smaller size and lighter weight are really great the touch screen is also a big improvement over the oldies especially for readers of nonfiction footnotes,very nice reader

4.0,i am impressed with how easy it is to read and turn pages i however feel that is worth the extra 20 to get the one without the ads it messes with my reading mojo after the ads turned on i went and paid the extra 20 to get them turned off this was worth it i have waited a long time to buy an ereader and i am glad i waited to get this one,great reader spend the extra 20 to get no special offers

5.0,very nice the best ereader i have ever owned the size is perfect neither too big nor too small for reading the black and white screen allows you to read at whatever pace you want as it is far easier on the eyes than most color tablets the battery life is outstanding i read on it almost everyday and typically go for weeks without needing to recharge the page turning speed is blazing fast unlike many other ereaders that i have tried very durable my clumsy self has dropped it a few times but it has held up well it is intuitive and easy to use overall the best ereader in this price range hands down,the best ereader in this price range hands down

5.0,exelente,five stars
4.0,reading is easier with no glare i dont have to move or find a good place where the light doesnt make it difficult to read to me the screen appears bigger i like the fact that it holds the page i am reading when i turn it off then goes right back to that page with no buttons to change pages keeps me on the same page i really like the touchscreen i wear glasses the screen makes it easier for me to read i am not much of a reader had difficulty with another kindle reading making it past a page with my kindle i read more since i see more,appreciate my kindle
5.0,i received my kindle as a christmas gift and have really found myself enjoying reading again my favorite time to read is after i go to bed i seem to sleep better when i read just before going to sleep since i received it i find that i look forward to going to bed at night i had gotten away from reading because when you read hard covered books in bed they seem to get heavy and clumsy my problem is that i am a paperback snob and love to get hardcover books but find that i dont read them because like i said i pretty much only read in bed,i like reading in bed again
5.0,i really like this kindle books are easy to download and sync quickly for reading i purchased two kindles and each one is named so that i dont have to remember which one i am downloading to bookbubcom for kindle gives me many book options at regular reduced and even free prices and automatically asks which kindle reader i want to download to way less hassle than nook that now sits in a drawer,kindle and loving it

4.0,i read quite a bit 2 to 3 novels a week i got this free on a black friday deal i have an ipad with kindle app and enjoy reading on that i never saw the need for an eink reader after reading on the kindle touch for a few weeks i can easily see the appeal that being said the improvements of adjustable backlight and more importantly the increased resolution of the voyage would be must haves if i were going to pay for a dedicated eink reader are those improvements worth the premium cost of the voyage at 200 no i could see myself buying an eink reader with the voyages specs at the 100 price point though pros easy on the eyes cost cons slightly blurry text though easily overlooked and lack of a backlight,hard to argue with free

4.0,i had the original kindle and the screen stopped working so i purchased this model i think it works well and has some good features but i miss my first one it had the bigger screen and buttons to turn the page which i prefer the touch screen is sensitive and when i move around it advances the page on me it does not hold the book open indefinitely so i have to search to find the book again and reopen it i found the old kindle menu system better all in all it does what i need and has the paper white non glare screen its very portable and works on my treadmill,i think it works well and has some good features but i miss my first one
2.0,frankly im disappointed this is not my first kindle and i have two major complaints about the new one first there is not a decent lighted cover to go with it i miss the one that was attached to my last kindle after sending two nonworking covers back ive resorted to a reading light ducktaped to the back it works but doesnt lay flat second my favorite game triple town doesnt work on this kindle i really liked that game the touch screen is nice but i wish i had my old unit back,gameless in gaza

4.0,nice little ereader for the price the only thing that is disappointing is the freetime option which is one of the main reasons i bought it what happens is all your books load into the freetime and then you check the box for the books you ant in there but according to the manual you can delete the books off the list so you dont have to sort through the tens or hundreds you have i tried to delete the books i wanted in there plus worked with customer service on this and they said you cant delete the books even though it says so in the manual otherwise i would give it a 5 star and after i use it more i will do another update as its only been a week of use,nice little ereader for the price

5.0,yeahi really enjoy using this it is my first kindle and for the 49 price tag on black friday it was hard to say no it is easy on the eyes and its great to use especially in my office many users that i see posting on here mention the buttons on the previous versions of the kindle and i have to say that i definitely can understand the advantage of having buttons versus the touch screen sometimes the touch screen isnt as responsive as i would like it to be for me it doesnt detract from the 5 star rating i gave it because everything else is so userfriendly,it is worth it
4.0,it looks so much like reading a real book my only complaint is that you can adjust text size in ebooks but you cant do that or zoom in when you use the kindle store or goodreads app im visually impaired so seeing the words is sometimes hard for me other than that its perfect,i love it

4.0,i would give this kindle a five star review but for one thing there is constantly an advertisement on the screen trying to sell me a book i have absolutely no interest in i suppose that is why this model with specials was 30 bucks cheaper than usual unfortunately amazon never explained what with specials meant i wish i could get a software upgrade to eliminate the ads shame on amazon,i hate the constant ads
5.0,my daughter absolutely loves it i had to buy it to replace the nook she had that i lost on her thought i would teach her a lesson because she was always leaving it laying around so i put it away i still cant find after a year so i purchased this kindle and she likes it even better than the nook thank you,so i purchased this kindle and she likes it even better than the nook
2.0,i really like being able to turn the page by just touching the screen the first kindle which i had for a very long time was anoying because i had to push the sides to change the pagethe only negative is not knowing what page im on ive never liked the percentage concept to tell me where i am in the book wish they would come up with a way to number the pages like a real bookit travels well and is small enough to put into my handbag so overall it gives me what i need in a reader,i really like being able to turn the page by just touching

3.0,the big bonus is that this kindle model is very light and portable and was very easy to set up the price point was appealing too the downside is that even in daylight or in a normallit room in the evening the display is not bright enough for my eyes to adjust comfortably there is no backlighting setting ie no brightness adjustment on this kindle and it is not entirely glarefree i was hoping to take it on my camping excursions or to be able to read at night in my bed however a fullylit room or an overhead reading lamp will be necessary if you wear glasses or have eye issues you will want to consider a model that offers a brightness setting,i dont see the light

1.0,i really liked my earlier model which broke after 14 months now you have really screwed up with this model of kindle some objections include when accessing the list of already purchased books you have to sift through the illegible book covers for the titles 36 at a time which are interspersed with recommended purchases which you can accidentally buysince you cant read the title anyway on half of the book covers anyway seems a guise it encourage additional purchases accidentally the efficient text listing of previously purchased books utilized on the previous model was much betteralso any random touch on the device may change the page perhaps tens of even hundreds of pages and finding the original site where you left off is very cumbersome at bestif you can find it without rereading half a dozen chapters to see where you werethere are also some other minor complaints but basically it seems you took a good device which was working well and screwed it up also in an apparent effort to manipulate customers into subscribing to the kindle unlimited deal the prices on individual books purchased have abruptly and dramatically increasedso take my adviceif you have not purchased a kindle dontstick with books,i really liked my earlier model

3.0,its fine its a kindle but cant say i like the touchscreen there is not a lot of room to hold it touching the screen unintentionally causes windows to open which is irritating and it was easier and more ergonomic for my hands to turn the page with a button than the touchscreen still value the kindle but mehso not impressed with touchscreen,not fond of the touchscreen
5.0,just love it having a bit of trouble getting used to it since i was used to the older version do not like the way the books are displayed cant tell which ones i have read in the past since all my books were downloaded i am sure i will get used to it,just love it having a bit of trouble getting used

5.0,i love having a kindle i was hesitant to get an ereader but fell in love with them this year its lightweight and portable i love that i can read it outside without a glare and that i can store multiple books on it i am able to read books for a low cost with the library loans and the kindle borrowers library i am thrilled with this purchase and encourage even the most skeptical to give it a tryalso i bought a case for it and it gave me that book feel i had been missing,i love having a kindle
3.0,still trying to figure out how to use this thing a lot of the books i downloaded are just exerpts from a bigger book which is what i thought i was getting so that is disappointing the whole point of getting a kindle was so i could read a lot more books for less  that has not turned out to be so maybe it will get better when i learn more about using it right now its just frustrating ,kindle not what i expected
2.0,too complicated as compared to my old kindle i just want to read books i dont want to critique them for others i make my choices based on the short summaries provided i dont need all those things coming on every time i touch the screen too fast or too slow or in the wrong place and i have trouble finding the new books i order id also like the option of permanently removing from my devices old already read books,somethings dont work for me

1.0,while i like this kindle it doesnt present graphics maps in the case of the first book i am reading in regular font or print the entire map is faded and hard to read ie map characters and word font are so light that it is very hard to read the map i had to use a magnifying glass under a bright light to read the maps,graphics display
1.0,as far as im concernedits a piece of junk the first thing i noticed was that it refused to show me all the books i had purchased i could get 6 but it refused to show me the other 15 the home page at top wont some up no matter how i try to get it i managed to open a book and got it somewhere near the page i had been reading on my old kindle but the dictionary kept popping up when not required and i couldnt get rid of it everything froze i couldnt turn pages in either direction i couldnt call up the home page i couldnt even turn the machine off when i tried the page with the frozen dictionary would still be on the kindle and it stayed there when i tried to turn it off a second time and possibly reset the thing the same page with the dictionary was still there nothing i touched would coax it to leave i tried to turn it off again and a popup shot up in front of the dictionary and asked me if i wanted to cancel restart or produce a blank page but i couldnt do any of those things it just sat there and wouldnt go away the page wouldnt turn the home banner at top wouldnt appear nothing worked i couldnt get rid of the dictionary and then a wise word screen showed covering up the dictionary and it wouldnt go awayi would ask you to replace this trash if i wasnt worried about getting another just like it will you take it back if you wont replace it its going into the garbage can where it undoubtedly belongs,sheer unadulterated trash

1.0,after lugging around a 101 tablet for nearly 5 years now and hacking new versions of android on it just so i could continue to update software i realised that it was time to upgrade my hardware this decision was only decided after receiving a nice bonus from work and finally justifying a technology upgrade after hour upon hour of internet research i decided to go with something advertised as having a long battery life and built to serve the same purpose as my dieing 101 tablet that was so old it could only really be used to read books that old hacked relic still works though mind you i work offshore and often we do not have the luxuries of tv or internet available when weather is bad and books suffice the only form of entertainment available next to twiddling your thumbs until you go out of your mind even when weather is good i can only handle taking hours for a section of facebook to load due to slow satellite internet speeds prior to my most current venture offshore now as i write this i was ordering a new xps13 to replace my also dieing antique intel atom powered netbook low and behold i see an advertisement for a payment plan to get a kindle so i say what the hell adding a measly 15 to a well researched and highcost laptop purchase isnt going to break the bank all of this occurred prior to going back to work what joy i had when receiving the new toys to replace the old stone age relics i was lugging around for entertainment not to mention the weight reduction with modern devices when carrying them in my backpack while on deck i tested both devices to confirm their functionality to determine if i would need to send anything back before embarking on airline flights bus routes and a helicopter ride before being trapped out at sea with only books and a handful of movies on a hard drive so i plugged the kindle into my brand new laptop and uploaded the novels dungeon masters guide and pdfs of useful technical manuals for my work im an electrical technician from my tablet to the kindle everything worked i was able to test both devices simultaneously so after opening a couple books i confirmed it is certainly a thing that does make books happen packed it up and prepared for the long journey and after my wife dropped me off to the airport and i made through tsa without being too molested i open my bag to continue reading george rr martins feast for crowsthe kindle only displays screen artifacts no softreset attempts work or help no amount of charging throughout the trip from my 21a battery pack helpi wont get those 18 hours of agonizing boredom back i did however try charging it from the wall outlet nearly 12 more hours when arriving to my ship with no further change or improvement and have begun the amazon troubleshooting process so we will see how that goesbut i am still on the fence on whether i want to feed it to the sharks or not considering our internet connection while in the middle of the ocean is 56k dialups ugly cousin it may very well be that by the time this review posts i may be back on shore or an aging man retiring from a career of offshore work who knows but if i am able to get through to amazon and work something out i will update this furthermeanwhile forever yourslong time amazon prime shopper and enthusiastdisappointed by latest future book technology,firsttime kindle ownernot too impressed

5.0,i love it no glare easy to read and easier to use than the old keyboard kindle that i also loved its handier to hold because its lighter and smaller has a great feel and responds well to touch without being too responsive and moving up too many pages like some tablets do it is truly glare free and thats important for me because i cant even read the paper white without problems this is just perfect for long hours of reading and for flipping through sections of books like cookbooks or travel guides where you want to find a recipe or a topic quickly,truly glare free

1.0,the worst thing is that it didnt have a light i had to use a lamp to read in bed i also had trouble downloading a book from my local library i had to use my desktop through a usb it still didnt work i returned this item for a kindle fire witch is sooooo much better,get the kindle fire instead

2.0,there is no brightness adjustment on this model if you need or want this option you are out of luck i have an older version of the basic kindle and it was on that one i had to return it and order the kindle paperwhite for 40 more that feature should be on all models,kindle too dark
4.0,ok ive always loved reading but i stopped ages ago i guess with the internet boom anyway i got this kindle as a gift and its fantastic im starting to read again like i used to and it feels great the kindle is light and feels natural to hold i spent a couple hours reading the other day and my hands didnt tire nor did my eyes the only issue i can come up with is the fact that the screen is darker than the average book like i might be able to read a read book using less light then i can with the kindle not a huge problem just something i noticedside note i bought an adorable fintie cover for it and now my life is complete,look ma i can still read
1.0,unable to view screen in living room light which makes it worthless there is no way to make the screen brighter unlike the original whitepaper kindle if i wanted something that i had to turn a light on to read i could read a paperback,too dim to read without artifical light
5.0,it is amazing no more paperback stories for my kids its easy for them to use and download what they likeand the most important thing that there is no screen light which make it safe for their eyes,it is amazing no more paperback stories for my kids
3.0,its good if you make the font small then you get a lot of information on one screenwhat i didnt like is the advertising that kept popping upi even changed my setting to stop the advertising and it continued with reading suggestionsi know what i want so i put away and am going to the library again,stop the ads and itd be great
4.0,the page turning and any sort of screen changes like coming back from the screensaver or turning back on the screen are jumpy thats my only complaint its simple just like i wanted and very light and easy to use with one hand the screen is perfect sharp enough and just like looking at a real page,its simple just like i wanted and very light and easy to use 
5.0,such a convenient way to read now,five stars

4.0,my daughter is an avid reader and loves this kindle the price was great around christmas time the only downfall with this model is there is no builtin light we remedied that by buying a case with a light it was far more economical than buying the newer model,the price was great around christmas time
3.0,wasnt looking for anything sophisticated weighs nothing and there really is no glare but really disappointed that i didnt spend the extra bucks for one with a backlight battery does last and it is convenient to carry around,great nofrills reader
3.0,i needed to read the specifications more carefully the picture is very misleading it is a picture of the backlighted version this version needs good light to read anything and the screen is rather dull,this version needs good light to read anything and the screen is rather

4.0,this is an incredible device i really enjoy reading on it i bought this version without the buildin light because i though that this feature could be replaced reading on open air andor with light but i was wrong i can read without the light but i feel like with the light it could be more easier but again i knew about this before buying it so is not amazons fault im definetly buying the paperwhite model in the near future,amazing ereader for the price

5.0,i needed a kindle to read in the sunlight i had a first generation kindle which after many many years failed to hold a battery charge longer than a day it still works and i am letting a friend use it i love all the kindle products they are priced fairly and the ease with which they work is amazing i use it all the time this was a gift from my daughter for christmas while i do not like the advertisements i see when i turn the device on and off they havent been offensive and she saved 20 this is the tool for anyone who loves to read,i love all the kindle products
1.0,it was great when i got my first kindle with the keyboard but the screen cracked it was really good when i got my second kindle and to protect it i got a cover with extra padding as i knew the screen was fragile it cracked it was good when i got my third kindle which i treated like a delicate fragile likely to crack at any moment piece of kit guess what it cracked no i never dropped them or flexed them but i decided that as good as i found them for reading they are hard to beat i drew the line at number 3 shame really thats life get something good but its just not good enough,it was great when i got my first kindle with the keyboard 
4.0,love the ability to have multiple books on my person at any time great for someone who is reading a number of books at the same time one comment to improve is that the browser can not download pdfs but if you have full feature computer you can download and transfer the files to it also a default option for showing larger versions of illustrations in books in certain cases you can tap on image and it will open a full screen version and in other instances it will move to next page,love it and some suggestions for features
3.0,i was really disappointed that there is no back light to read in bed at night that is the whole reason i bought it i guess i should have read the details better but sitting in my room reading with my phone flashlight makes no sense i may as well read from my phone the device is lightweight and the battery lasts forever,i was really disappointed that there is no back light to read in 
1.0,after charging the device i attempted for nearly an hour to use the touchscreen keyboard and register it unfortunately when i touched a letter or number either 1 nothing happened or 2 the correct key was highlighted but one next to it on the screen was input after toomanytocount times of using the back arrow key to erase and start over i finally got my user name and password onscreen would you say that is not very effective use of my timewell it got worse when i pressed the correct wifi network for my home the one below it on the screen was input and using the back arrow did nothingi phoned amazon kindle support and the agent told me id have to download the software which she said wasnt loaded into the kindle onto my computer and then load it into the kindle via usb after about ten minutes more of frustration with nothing online where she told me it would be and her suggesting i change usb ports i told her i no longer wanted a kindle i have better uses for my time if i want to read an ebook ill read it on my laptop which performs as it shouldi am returning it for a refund today,i dont recommend this device
2.0,no i though it had a build in light,two stars
3.0,while actually reading its great screens clear and easy on the eyes the biggest problem is trying to browse my library to get a book theres reading suggestions and other things that take up space on the front page i was used to using the kindle app for my ipad so this was a bit of a difficult transition also some people may be aware of this i was not when i ordered there are no speakers or headphone jack so you cant use it with audiblewhispersync,its great screens clear and easy on the eyes
5.0,i love the size its perfect for work,five stars
4.0,great reader lightweight easy to hold there is still a slight glare in really severe or bright light but still much better than your standard tablet screen the internet capability is slow so even though you could use the web browser its kind of slow i suggest using this as a reader only,awesome reading tablet
5.0,much improved over old kindle great,great
5.0,battery does indeed last days even with heavy usage im getting roughly 8 days off a full charge reading on it between 4 and 7 hours per day easy to navigate easy to set up wifi and turn airplane mode on and off and easy to change font styles sizes and margins best investment ive made for the amount of travel i do,easy to navigate
1.0,not a fan didnt send it back because at some point someone in the family might use it its not backlit so i cant read while trying to get my daughter to sleep it has a blinking like refresh that im not fond of as well ill just stick to my iphoneipad,it has a blinking like refresh that im not fond of as well
5.0,love new kindle wonderful at thr beach last week people asked about compact size i am a great spokesperson for amazoni have owened seven read try dying ordered next book in seriesfun vacation reads hooked on legal thrillers keep them coming,cool kindle s and amazon books
3.0,very disappointed that there is no audio facility my last kindle was used mainly to listen to books as i drove i spend 50 of each work day in my truck and had the last kindle connected to the speaker system i received this new kindle as a gift and although the functionality of reading of books is better i am disappointed that the oral listening function was eliminate i now will try my smart phone as an audio reading device but i will not use kindle on it this is my way of letting amazon know of how disappointed i am in the decision to remove the audio function,no audio listening function
5.0,i bought this as a christmas present for my mom and i just got it today and it came within 5 days so far its great everything works smoothly and its very easy to use im definitely regretting buying this for my mom and not me,its great everything works smoothly and its very easy to 
1.0,this is a complete scam the fact you have to pay 20 to have ads removed is absurd also with so many of the same books for purchase on the site why is it you can find those same books for free on the internet the quality of this product is so cheap i expect it to break on the first drop i dont know how people can actually say they like this,i dont know how people can actually say they like this
4.0,easy to open easy to operate and connect its very intuitive im 300 pages into my first book and im having a hard time reading for more than 45 minutes without taking a break i havent decided if its me my eyes the book or the kindle im going to try a cover its a great size but doesnt feel like a book and download one of my favorite books and see how it goes  i do love how easy it is to use and the battery life is great,easy to open
3.0,i like my 1st kindle better where it listed all my books plus those archived i prefer the controls on the original kindle especially the buttons on the sides it is only black and white which is not a problem but i cannot find any way to change the contrast i do like how it is glare free and looks like a book makes it easier reading in the sun,overall not bad
5.0,my old kindle from 5 years ago finally kicked the bucket so i began my search for a new one my husband has the kindle paper white but i didnt like how the light couldnt be turned completely off i tried using his but it hurt my eyesi decided to try the 6 glare free as it is the closest thing to my old kindle that i could find minus the buttons and keyboard ive been really happy with it the battery life is long and it is easy on my eyes books download quickly its user friendly and easy to search for new books,but i didnt like how the light couldnt be turned completely off
4.0,my biggest gripe is that there is no way to have a case that has the light built in like my kindle with the keyboard had otherwise the kindle itself is good still getting used to it but no complaints really, have a case that has the light built in like my kindle with the keyboard had
5.0,i received this as a christmas gift from my sister and i couldnt be happier ive been saying i wanted one for years but never bought it i am a avid book reader so its great to have all of my books in one place i really like the glare free screen and the fact that you can change the font size the kindle is a really convenient size not too big not too small wifi compatibility is a huge plus i would definitely recommend this product,love it
5.0,i love this device i was wary about buying an ereader i felt like i was cheating on books but im so glad i bought it no glare and so light and thin that i can ready it on the subway with one hand and hold on with the other go great,i love this device
3.0,it works perfectly but i have the fire and used to have the original wifi and this one just seems cheap lighter and more of a cheap plastic feel i bought it because i dont like the fire when im out in the sun but while the screen is great i just cant like the unit as a whole so i bought a used earlier model will sell this one or give it to a relative,kindles cheap knock off of a kindle
4.0,i love how lightweight my kindle is the only option i wish this had was a brightness feature in case i want to read without the lights on but i guess that deters from the mirage of reading out of an actual book,i love how lightweight my kindle is
5.0,i gave this product 5 stars because i really cannot find anything i do not like about it i just recently decided that i want to sit down and start reading books with that said this is my first kindle and i absolutely love it i just purchased it a few days ago and i already read a full book i recommend this product,perfect for me
5.0,it is very light and portable when i am reading with it my eyes are much more comfortable comparing using ipad and iphone it is definitely worthy to have one even though this does not have light itself however i think it is better to read in a good environment rather than reading it in a dark place with the light,portable and good for eyes
4.0,love it very much easy reading books download fast easy to hold perfect to read anywhere price of books are cheap good choice of books i like i can order my books from my laptop and they download right to my kindlei do wish it lite up for i can read when traveling in the dark other wise it would be a five starthank you kindle for making my reading time easy,all readers should own a kindle
5.0,excellent,five stars
4.0,because i was used to my older kindle it has taken me a while to get used to the new kindle i am disappointed that i can not listen to books as i could with the older one never thought that it would not have that capability after using it for a few days the touchscreen is a great addition and the book reviews that are immediately available for each book are great all in all i am mostly satisfied with my new kindle,i am disappointed that i can not listen to books as i

3.0,the kindle glare free does not have color is made of plastic has poor display and also looks like an oversized calculator although this all is true and is not to much of a proble the kindle has wifi which allows it able to connect to the amazon store the kindle only has two uses which both meet if not standards but above reading and buying books,glare free book
1.0,i bought this for my husband to replace our first kindle it was one of the old ones and he loved it it didnt have pictures and was easy to find new books from all the ones in our my collection he hates this new one he cant find stuff he finds it hard to use if i could trade it in on a kindle fire i would hes using mine and im stuck with the ipad which i hatedo you have a solution for usthanks,help needed
3.0,i used to say i loved my kindle… now its just eh when my original kindle ereader stopped working i received horrible customer service trying to resolve the problem after it was determined my kindle couldnt be repaired i was told amazon would replace it then i was told that i would be given a discount on a replacement then i was told a discount wasnt available for a replacement unless i upgraded to a fire all in the span of 3 minutes after receiving no help from customer service including one incomprehensible email written in broken english i gave up and just purchased the closest thing i could find to what i had prior since i prefer an ereader i settled on this version i wish i still had my old ereader as the touch screen on this is well touchy to say the least sometimes when i touch the screen to advance a page it advances many pages and returning to where i was becomes a scavenger hunt of sorts the battery life is is not as good as the old version either rather than a screensaver there are advertisements which is fine but last week i had my first pop up advertisement which i find invasive the one thing i do like about this version is that it is small and light easily fits into a purse,eh not as good as the older model
1.0,i bought this for my 7 year old daughter who loves to read it was difficult for me to work and maneuver i knew there was no way she could do it it was hard to return to the home page to change books i was also finding it difficult to find books for her to read i gave it to her on christmas morning to see if she could do better than me and she didnt like it either she asked me to return it so i did,disappointed
3.0,was excited to get new kindle still using my kindle 2 and love it but could not pass on 49 deal disappointed that when i downloaded my books they were not in collections like i had my old kindle sorted needed to re sort my books into collections which is a lot of work if i knew i had to do this would not have purchased new kindle with technogy did not expect to have to do the restring of books new version is lighter weight but old one was fine,somewhat disappointed

4.0,a grand ereading device from someone slavishly in love with paperbacks that begrudgingly uses one sometimes i miss the simplicity of the original kindle and the errorfree page forward and back buttons the touch functionality can result in some unexpected pagination results but overall a great product the goodreads integration is absolutely divine,a grand ereading device from someone slavishly in love with paperbacks that begrudgingly uses one

4.0,i am very happy with this kindle as i can now read outside without having pages flapping and having to carry a heavy book it is easy to use started using it from the moment i opened the box very easy to figure out i do find that you have to have bright light in the house to be able to read the kindle but that is not a problem once again while i am outside it is very easy to read which is why i bought iti highly recommend this kindle i cant tell that it is refurbished it looks like a brand new one,great for outdoors

4.0,very nice tool to read books it is easy for the eyes and extremely easy to get new books the only thing i can see that could be improved is to have a quicker way to shut the screen off than just pushing the on button for several seconds,very nice tool to read books

3.0,theres no function to adjust brightness which means that you will need a separate light source which means it will be just as pathetically useless as a book in a dark roomapart from that disappointing fact its very easy to use and i like to read on this device instead of my ipad which is heavy and has a screen thats overly sensitive to touch,which means it will be just as pathetically useless as a book in a dark room

4.0,the kindle was a perfect gift for my 10 year old daughter my daughter got one for christmas and had been reading on it everyday since my son wants one now as wellmy daughter had difficulty with understanding what she is reading at times due to not knowing the definition of a word she can now look up the definition while she is reading rather than asking someone later and taking all information in at once,perfect gift
5.0,im totally satisfied with my kindle glarefree 7th generation reading ebooks was never as easy as it is right nowvocabulary builder software is also amazing it is helping me a lot to further learn new english words,totally recommend it
5.0,1simple package but very cost effective with no useless rubbish inside2battery lifefeels like about 1518hours continuous reading is ok not very precise i tested twice first time about 4days every day about 34 hours reading second time 7hours reading a time more than 50 battery left3reading performance ok various of format available with ordinary and special function for better reading4service good can response in short timea very happy shopping experience,new kindle read more
3.0,i had the generation ii kindle for years and unfortunately it quit working a month ago while i was on a business trip i needed my reading material so i went right over to best buy and purchased this kindle i am not as happy with it i find the screen so sensitive to touch that i often lose my place in the book because the pages turn or sometimes the pages turn in the wrong direction it can get confusing and frustrating i do like having the dictionary built into the screen and i like how light it is i read at least two books a week on my kindle i do really love kindles but i think the older ones were better designed,original kindles were better
5.0,what can i say i love this device ive been an avid reader my entire life and there is no doubt that this device solves all my research needsall my life ive always had to keep three items by my side while reading any form of printed text a dictionary an encyclopedia wikipedia and a notepad for jotting down notes so obviously later on i figured the best thing to purchase is a tablet another one of the best inventions which would make it alot easier to pull up information on the go but lo and behold the fire kindle is created what a beautiful device with all the features an avid reader could ever ask for i didnt even mention how it solves library storage but i wont even bother to get into all the details the information is here on the website so just go out and buy one dont be a sour old grump like some other old school readers who wants to hold on to the orthodox ways of life once you get one i guarantee youll make them jealous like my wife lolyou owe it to yourself,one of the best devices i own
5.0,just what i was looking and specting for the dictionarywikipedia its a great idea for helping understand some concepts that the context cant help you to figure out you can hold too much books since they arent heavy no pain on the eyes because it doesnt have light just like a book but without the weight or the smell a great deal and a great tool,great deal great tool
5.0,am a first time kindle user i loved the antiglare feature and the fact that we can read pdfs in this and need not buy all the items for us to read just got delivered from amazon today standard twoday delivery thanks to amazon so far the feel is good really compact will update it after a month or two of real use cheers,great buy for a first timers 
5.0,i received this as a birthday gift and i absolutely love it its light weight and very easy to navigate between screens the fact that you are able to get the look of a real book in text is what this kindle is all about navigating to purchase books and to access good read is a breeze i highly recommend this kindle,love it
3.0,kindle is one of my favorite devicesi decide it to change my old kindle keyboard model with this new touch kindlethe device looks wonderful and reacts very fast but i was very disappointed about 2 things1 the device doesnt have jack for audio i think that there are a lot of people who reads and listen to music 2 the device doesnt have a case with light like the keyboard model this is very frustrating because i liked very much the light case for my old kindle,kindle no 1 in reading devices
4.0,good product for the price but i guess amazon must incorporate a feature so that we can download audio books abd listen it over this devicealso the screen is great is brigth light but is ureadable in low light situations i guess a backlit display would help betterover all a great product for this price,good product for the price

5.0,the lightweight design allows me to flow through my reading material with comfort i find myself reading through my entire book with no fatigue to my wrist the nonglare screen is amazing and the fact that i can adjust the font to suit my tired eyes is wonderful its like having had an eye exam at just the right moment thank you for making reading a joyful experience once again,the nonglare screen is amazing and the fact that i can adjust the font

4.0,i didnt know how to operate the kindle and wish you had included a paper instruction sheet which would have helped me start it was a hunt and peck guess work for the first couple of times and contrary to my other kindles i dont know how to call for help i saved the sheet from the second one i have fortunately i love how light it is the first one helped break a strap on an expensive purse i took on a trip barbara volin,i saved the sheet from the second one i have fortunately i love how light it is
5.0,i love it i was never much of reader while in school i hated being forced to read before middle school i would read all the time but in middle school and high school i read the least amount as possible graduated and tried to get back into reading but hated having an actual book but then i picked up this kindle and i have read more in the couple weeks of having it then i probably have in the past few years its great my wife has the 2nd or 3rd generation kindle with they keyboard on the bottom and has had it for a few years and has loved it,i love it i was never much of reader
5.0,the screen is very sensitive not only for finger but also for any other hard object such as a pen besides reading on this device feels like reading with a real book i can read it for the entire day without feeling uncomfortable as reading in my ipad the only thing that i dont like is it dont have a speaker with it for a person who spend always spend the entire weekends reading reading with the accompany of music would be amazing,reading on this device feels like reading with a real book
5.0,i love the touch screen i think the kindles ink is really sharp it is so much easier to read on then a tablet i didnt think i would ever convert from paperbacks to a kindle but i do love the convince i am glad that i dont have book clutter any more,no book clutter hurray

4.0,i purchased this kindle to replace an older version that finally wouldnt work any longer i actually like my old kindles pushbutton feature better to go back and forth from the pages i read in bed and it accidentally slipped a bit in my hands and i somehow ended up many chapters ahead from where i was reading it was a bit of a hassle and annoying to go back to where i was i guess ill get used to it i am also a bit disappointed it didnt fit in my old kindles case as it is smaller would have been nice if it was made adaptable to it since the cases arent cheap other than those complaints i love reading from my kindle the screen really is glarefree i often read from the kindle app on my phone if i dont have my kindle but that doesnt work well outside because of the glare no problem with the kindle,not a fan of the touch screen
5.0,i like this device very much its light weight and cool to touchi find that i have plenty of access to the web and i just wanted something for booksthis is great for my needs also kindle books are more reasonable than othersgood luck in you ereader search,kindle simple

5.0,i love my new kindle i was debating as to whether or not i needed a separate reading device as i was previously using the kindle app on my ipad if you are on the fence i say go for it reading on the kindle is enjoyable whereas reading on the kindle app on the ipad is merely bearable get a kindle if you like to read even a little bit just get one already,great purchase
5.0,ive had the kindle app on my ipad for years now and ive found that when i want to read a book i end up reading my email personal and work my twitter feed my tumblr dashboard the news i have two news apps the multiple forums to which im subscribed then i check the weather and play a game of solitaire two dots or trivia crack at that point im no longer in the mood to read a booki got this basic kindle in the hopes that i would actually unwind and read before going to sleep it worked now im enjoying books again and as a bonus i can read in the bright afternoon sunlight on my deck after work well worth every penny,im reading books again
5.0,very nice,five stars
4.0,i am for the most part very pleased with my purchase i like the free samples and books being downloaded directly to my device however i took one star off because i was unaware that there are advertisements every time i lock the screen which is a little annoying overall definitely worth the money,i am for the most part very pleased with my purchase

4.0,i really like it now that i have gotten used to it i havent got the light touch mastered yet it keeps changing the font at will lol its just the right size the battery lasts longer than my first kindle and i like the background its easy on my eyes,i really like it now that i am used to it
4.0,i have an issue with the fact that the power button is on the bottom when on the train holding in an awkward position the power is constantly getting hit and turning off the device its larger than the one i orignally had but i guess i got use to that,i have issue with the fact that the power button is 
5.0,i received this as a gift and it is my first ereader i would highly recommend for first time users great value i love how user friendly it is since large books tend to be daunting i love the feature to hide what page you are oni find myself actually reading more and checking my progress everysooften i also use in conjuction with amazon prime kindle unlimited and goodreads site,easy to hold and use
5.0,i love my new kindlei use it when i travel and at home its perfect for me as it is light weight and so easy to carry i am in my 50s i cannot carry alot in my carryons anymore the screen is small so my reading glasses are a must as in most cases its quick its fun and its a amazon producti will purchase more amazon products in the future they have my vote,great thats all can say
3.0,the extra gifts are mainly advertisement its a small device easy to handle and not heavy reading with it is the almost the same as reading paper books youll need a book light if its dark no glare outside easy on the eyes which is great not friendly for pdf files reading good overall considering the price however if you can go for a newer model i would recommend to do so,easy to handle and not heavy
4.0,i enjoy reading using this kindle it is nice and compact about the size of a normal paper back book the screen is nice and easy to read it seems to work without any glitches i do wish it had manual buttons to turn the pagesthe screen can be a little sensitive but not bad enough that it would turn me off from buying one overall good product,overall very satisfied
5.0,been using it for about a week now and i love it very user friendlywasnt sure if i was going to like the swipe featuremy last kindle had the turn page button but i love it held a charge for over a week no complaints, using it for about a week now and i love it very user friendly
5.0,if youre wondering about getting a kindle i can say without reservation that it is one of the best purchases ive ever made the access to out of print classics the fresh writings of new authors and everything in between has provided me with uncounted hours days weeks of great reading i can honestly say that my kindle has paid for itself just from the savings ive gotten from just one author add to that the fact that the cubic footage of storage no longer required for my books has seriously reduced the clutter of my life,great way to save money and space

4.0,i like this and got a great deal but my bad for not reading the fine print i have paperwhite envy not enough to drop extra cash as i wanted a device that could be taken to the beach and not worried about in the event of damage and i just always read by light so in that sense its not much different than a book good deal i dropped my first generation kindle so have only used kindle on phone or ipad this is nice to have,great value

2.0,while i still like the convenience of my new kindle reader i am very disappointed with this 7th generation model i previously had the original kindle with the keyboard built into the device its self which i absolutely loved it is supposedly an advance to have a touch pad but it is very annoying if you put the kindle down if anything passes close to the screen or if my dog walks between me and the screen it advances about 20 pages and it is very difficult to get it to go backwards usually requiring about 5 minutes of fiddling with the machine to get it back to the right page totally destroying the enjoyment of the book i really really miss my old kindle i really wish amazon still sold them they were great,i miss my old kindle

3.0,this is a device that demonstrates regression this is very portable better at being glare free than other kindles of its type and is fast at the things it does some things must be clearly noted 1 there is no internal illumination and it can be read only with external light 2 there is no audio and no jack for audio at the special price of 59 with adverts it is probably overpriced anywhere from 10 to 20 i dont recall the description well but the features it was lacking came as sort of a surprise and i felt they should have been mentioned more prominently otherwise it operates well as a cheap reader,less than you pay for

5.0,i havent had much previous experience with kindles in the past that being said this is everything i could have asked for in an ereader the eink is easy to read and doesnt give me a headache after long periods of time like my phone screen did all in all it was well worth the purchase if youre on the fence about buying one make the jump and buy it you wont be sorry,an ereader worth the money
5.0,excelente,five stars
3.0,liked the older version w the qwerty keyboard better still it seems to work pretty well this was purchased for my wife on the occasion of her old kindle up dying on her she tried amazon tech support customer service first to see if it was salvageable she said the rep was surprised the kindle was so old that they really werent designed to last that long so built in obsolescence thats disappointing it will certainly inform my choices when it comes time to replace mine just as old as hers but still chugging along,its ok
5.0,luv it,five stars
5.0,absolutely outstanding i got this during the prime day special but i would not hesitate to pay full price for one of these it is compact and it fits in the large cargo pocket in my cargo shorts no glare when reading at the pool and much easier on the eyes than reading on a tablet,compact lightweight an excellent product
5.0,not bad honestlysince the new update for reading i am starting to use the bookerly font for reading instead of baskervillelike it says bookerly saves your eyes alotso now i can just stare at a page for so long then finally turn the page ,best yet
4.0,i love using this to read books it is inexpensive and the touch screen makes it much easier than my original kindle high lighting is much easier with the touch screen the other options like goodreads integration kindle freetime vocabulary builder and word wise are significance enhancements the only thing that can be a disadvantage is that it is not backlit so you can read in a poorly lit room or in bed while my wife is sleeping definitely worth the money,i love using this to read books
5.0,tbh there is not much to review it does as advertised and very simple to use what i will review is how quick they were able to get it shipped to a fpo ap box and how they already associated the sn with my account so i didnt have to sync anything as usual amazon comes through very impressed as always,great device even better service
5.0,i love my kindle ive had the first edition nook for several years and it needed replacing so i went with the kindle this time i did not want a tablet due to glare and it kills my eyes after too long this is perfect light easy to use just perfect,i adore this kindle
5.0,i received this as a gift from my sisters with the case and i absolutely love it i recommend this item if youre looking for something to download books only the battery last a long time at first i wanted the nook but this is just want i needed ❤❤❤, from my sisters with the case and i absolutely love it i recommend this item if youre looking 
4.0,been reluctant to use a kindle however i wish it had been around 20 years ago merely have to look up titles and order the book immediately at your fingertips carry all your books in a small package couldnt be happierits like magic,its like magic
5.0,love it i dont need all the bells and whistles cant afford them anyway i just wanted a device where i could download books that had a screen without glare its the closest thing to reading real print,love it
3.0,it would be nice if overdrive was loaded onto the device i realize you want to sell books but in reality to be able to both check books out or buy them would make the device much more functional the only reason i got it was to check books out that i was missing in my hardback library without this feature on the kindle itself makes the device a disappointment,it would be nice if overdrive was loaded onto the device
2.0,there are no instructions for dowloading library from old kindle to new kindle i have not been able to use the new one because of this i realize there are instructions on the kindle but nothing i could find about switching between old and new,explicit instructions
5.0,love it ,five stars
5.0,all good,five stars
5.0,everything it was promised to be its very light and the 6 inch may be small for some but for a general use it gets the job done i have all my textbooks on the kindle and it makes it significantly easier to do school work the touch screen is responsive and battery has lasted me 2 weeks so far and still have roughly 50 with moderate use bit of a fingerprint magnet if that bothers you but nothing a sleeve of a shirt cant fix i suggest purchasing the kindle if you are in the market for an ereader,works great and exactly what i expected
5.0,i love it,five stars
5.0,great device i never thought that i would want to switch from real books to a kindle but i have changed my mind its great to take when traveling no more packing several books to take along,i love it

4.0,its good,four stars
3.0,this kindle is only so so still better than earlier versions the reading surface is a little dim as compared to the kindle paper white or kindle hdx i bought it thinking it would be a carrying along ereader for me spend a little more money and buy the kindle paperwhite and you will not regret dont waste your money on this gadget with todays technology you would expect something better i give a 3 stars because of the price,should stop selling this kindle
5.0,excellent,five stars
4.0,this is a terrific lowprice device it has one flaw the onoff button is on the bottom when i place it on the reading ledge of the machines in my gym it sometimes presses this button causing the device to turn itself off then on then off  the button should either be harder to press or located somewhere else,great but for one flaw
4.0,i like it,its all good
5.0,fantastic i resisted buying an ereader for years due to my romantic preference for hard copies you can hold and smell buying a kindle changed my life i now have thousands of books in my pocket sell you soul buy a kindle you will not regret it,sell your soul
5.0,great buy,fun reading
1.0,i considered this to be a waste of money yes i knew it didnt have a backlit screen when i bought it however that was irrelevant in a well lit room the screen was still too dark to read it is nothing like reading a printed book,too dark even in a well lit room
5.0,i didnt know it could be that good i mean its almost like reading a book but with the facility to change books search information and translate wordsif you complain when reading in a tablet or a computer you really should try this you wont regret,good product nice price
5.0,is good～and the ship time is fine,yoooo
3.0,the only reason i buy it is because this is the only device let kids read books only without any temptation to play gamesthe digital ink looks good however every time you flip a page the screen flashes a little i found it really annoying and wonder if this will do some harm to the vision health,only good for kids
1.0,i was highly disappointed with this product from initial use i can tell i would have issues the screen glitches constantly upon startup the screen goes in and out when maneuvering pages it glitches constantly i wouldnt bother sending it back because itll cost more than i spent on it,i was highly disappointed with this product
3.0,i was very disappointed to find that after i bought this kindle 6 it didnt have a light the writing is dim and its very hard to read unless im in a room with a bright light since i enjoy reading after going to bed at night this kindle just doesnt do it for me,no light on the kindle 6
5.0,for those who love read this is for you,five stars
5.0,a lot to learn but think it will be great,five stars
1.0,do you know this kindle doesnt have a light i didnt and if you look at the description it doesnt mention it unless you do a side by side comparison on a whole different web page without the backlight its very dim to read in ordinary dull daylight and impossible in a darkened room camping airplane make sure you check this out ive purchased several other kindles but this is the first one ive run across without lighting its going back,no lighting too dim
1.0,very difficult to operate my older one performs betterihave not been able to read even one book on it yet stillworking on it i think a refund is in order,my older one performs better i have not been able to read even 
4.0,another awesome amazon productwhats to say this is an awesome reading tool and i recommend themthis particular model is lightweight and very easy to usei purchased this for my mother for a christmas gift and she loves it it stores a ton of books the set up was easy and it is the perfect sizeif i could make a change it would be that all kindles were in color even the ones that only operate as an ereader i like to read a lot of truecrime books biographies and educational materials and most of these have pictures i just wish they were in color on all kindles,awesome
3.0,i honestly bought it off impulse and didnt look at the box or product in its entirety i thought they all came with internal lights which they dont that light is about 60 bucks more i do most of my reading at night while in bed so im not too sure this is going to get as much action,i honestly bought it off impulse and didnt look at 
3.0,this was a gift from my daughter who has one i never looked into it because i dont do well with this kind of thingit takes some getting used to however i wish it came with instructionsa booklet so that i can read it at myconvience and refer to and study it more carefully i find myself flipping back and forth too often when learningmy gift giver lives out of state unfortunatly hope i can improve to realy enjoy it cordially jan turner,new to this technology
5.0,love the light can read anywhere anytime,five stars
2.0,i didnt find it to be glarefree and the typesize changed without reason touch is too sensitive sometimes one tap went through 23 pages and finding my place was tedious and even when my finger was over but not on the screen it changed pages its compact but too small for comfort in my hands it was a bad buy for me,sometimes one tap went through 23 pages and finding my place was tedious and even when my finger was over but not 
5.0,so glad i broke down and bought one,five stars
5.0,i absolutely love my kindle i always made fun of people who had one as i love reading real books but since ive had my kindle the noglare nonbacklit screen doesnt hurt my eyes and makes it super easy to lounge around and read ive had it for less than a week and have already read two entire books my normal yearly average,i absolutely love my kindle
5.0,when all you want is a reader geat buy,five stars
5.0,this is the best device to read on no glare no distractions simple user interface i used to read on my phone and tablet but the kindle is by far a superior reading device you also get access to free books with amazon prime membership,stop reading on any other device
5.0,i purchased this because of the lighting ability we have power outages all the time and i can at least read while the power is out we dont always turn on the generator if its going to be out for a short time it can be calm and sunny and the power goes out so this device is a form of entertainment,helps in power outages
5.0,easy to use topnotch quality touschcreen user friendly interfase and good pixel density are features that make me feel happy with my purchase however i bought this for my mom who does not speak english so i would like to see more content available in spanish,easy to use
5.0,love it this is my third kindle and i would never use another reader i have tried another and it was rubbish the battery drained quickly and it was hard to load books on it kindle is amazing with the no glare and long battery life it syncing to all devices b,love my kindle
5.0,ive used previous generation kindles and i was a bit nervous about the touch screen but i actually prefer it its very easy to type with but i mostly like that i dont accidentally turn the page while holding it perfectly satisfied,its very easy to type with
4.0,clear and easy to read downloads are quick as is the setup relatively painless in the first few days i like the size it is about the size of a paperback book i do miss turning the page but the rapid page turns by touch are easy to get used to,fine summer reader

3.0,i prefer the controls on the original kindle especially the buttons on the sides the touch screen on the one being reviewed is too sensitive and the more gimmicky features keep coming up to interrupt my reading the screen however is superior to that of the original kindle,harder to use than it should have been
1.0,nothing about my new kindle is better than my old oneexcept the size my library is difficult to find way too many advertisements really sick of thatdifficult to find and move around in a booksorry i sent in my old one how shortsighted to listen to your advertisement and fall for itnot again amazon,nothing about my new kindle is better than my old one
4.0,great product language was french had to get on line to determine how to change the language so i could operate the devise other than that happy with the thing great feature in that i can down load all of the books we have already purchased to this devise,great product language was french
1.0,killed it immpediately worthless quality,not as good as the original
3.0,eh i like it i just dont love it it is slightly smaller than i thought and its just a bit slick which makes holding it when youre laying on your side difficult the screen is at times sensitive and then on responsive the screen is also incredibly delicate and after three days of reading i have significant scratches crumbs will scratch this screen do not swipe a crumb away as it will scratch i have already ordered the screen protector in the age of cell phone screens that are much more durable it was hard to imagine why this screen is so incredibly delicate,i like it i just dont love it
5.0,initially doubtful about the kindle im a paper and ink guy myself ive come to love this ereader small weight great readability easy learning curve i jumped right into kindle unlimited when i bought the kindle and its been extremely easy to keep a 10 book lineup waiting to be read well worth the monthly fee,ive come to love this ereader
5.0,the long battery life and light weight to carry makes kindle 6 a great thing for reading especially without all the distractions on the regular tablets i got it during thanksgiving sale and its a great deal really like itif you have a smartphone and like to read books i feel this is better choice than a tablet just my opinion,really like it
4.0,my daughter loves it my only reason for the 4 stars is because there us no way to add books to her free time unless i am with her and all the steps up have to go through to add a book to free time so i can not buy a book on the computer and send to her free time only her kindle and then go through all the steps to add to her free time sent email to amazon and hope they come up with an easier way,9 year old daughter loves
5.0,im soooo happy with my kindle this is my second kindle i also own the kindle 3g with keyboard i wanted this smaller version for work love the touch screen and its so light even with the case i purchased,happy with my kindle
4.0,ive been waiting for years to buy a kindle or a nook kindle won the only thing i had a problem with was how to return the books back from the kindle now i know what to do so far i like it very much,i like it very much
4.0,overall i like it the one annoying things is that unlike my nook i cant change fontssizemargin to make the text more comfortable on my eyes if there is a way its so secret its not even in the documentation,overall i like it the one annoying things is that
3.0,very good for the price i like that it is glarefree i prefer the controls on the original kindle especially the buttons on the sides newer kindle has touch screen to change pages which doesnt work very well when using a waterproof bag convenient size but screen is too sensitive to touch,very good for the price
5.0,i love it the glare free is awesome i use it when waiting on my kids at school and the tablet i used to use couldnt even read in the sun and i was tired of caring around a bunch of paper backs i love my new kindle,i love it the glare free is awesome i use it 
2.0,i stepped on my old kindle and thought this would be the same thing but it does not allow game playing and does not have a keyboard and the touch screen is too sensitive or wont move at all i am returning it and waiting for the kindle fire to arrive i hope i like it better but sure do miss my old one,i hope i like it better but sure do miss my old one
4.0,very nice unit easy to read and easy to set up it did not take long to charge up and today is ten days post charge that is when it arrived and the battery is still about 34 full the glarefree promise is true too it holds like and reads like a book without having to find a place to keep the book and you dont have to dog ear the page it remembers where you were in reading,nice reading
5.0,fantastic product small lightweight and really easy to use the only draw back i would have to say would be the lack of a back light but having moderate light you should be fine overall for the price this kindle is a steal,worth your time
5.0,the kindle makes reading on the go so much easier its convenient portable and exactly the right size to comfortably hold when readying there are also many user friendly features such as a builtin dictionary an the ability to see an outline of the entire book i was resistant to using a ereader device given my love of paper books but the ease and convenience of the kindle has won me over,portable and exactly the right size to comfortably hold when readying
3.0,the small size of this kindle is my biggest gripe im a fast reader so im always tapping to advance the page and continue for the price its a great backup to my two dx kindles which are both starting to go it was a spontaneous buy on amazon day and so far i havent had to recharge it not as easy to navigate as the dx more difficult to hold without mistakenly paging ahead ill keep it but i think this one may have been a mistake,not amazons best effort

3.0,i bought this replacement kindle after i lost my first generation kindle the touchscreen is a little too sensitive for me if i accidentally touch the screen which seems to be every ten seconds the font changes or will try to highligh phrases etc etc so annoying i miss the old school nontouch screen kindle actually this new kindle is a tad bit heavier than my old one about 06 ounces i think which doesnt seem like much but my wrists can tell the difference when im lying in bed and holding it up to readthat being said i love kindlebeing able to hold thousands of books in this 67 ounce reader battery life that lasts about a month,touch screen is too sensitive
5.0,great deal,love it

4.0,in hindsight i would have ordered the lighted screen but this was my first ereader and i stuck with the least expensive option still a fine purchase very pleased but it needs an app to secrete old book smell just to make the reading experience right,still a fine purchase very pleased but it needs an app

4.0,its great i like it because i can now have acces to my big college textbooks without having to go on my computer or having to carry the actually books around for the same school purposes thought i would love it if it had stand alone note taking capabilities that would make it a perfect machine oh and a but more customisable options like the ability to set my own screensavers but iter than that its great,its great i like it because i can now have

4.0,works well,four stars
5.0,this is such a great little device small enough to fit into a purse super easy to set up and so many books plus since libraries usually tend to have large selections of ebooks these days its possible to borrow all kinds of books for free i hesitated to get an ereader for a long time but im really glad i finally did,this is such a great little device
5.0,great device that reads just like a regular book it is very easy to buy books with and only takes around a minute to download a book you can get books with great prices the only downside is that you cannot read the kindle in the dark but you can read it in direct sunlight which makes up for that if you are a person who loves to read at night i would recommend the kindle fire,met expextations
5.0,i received this kindle as a gift a while back and use it on a daily basis i like it better than the more expensive kindles because it does not have a backlight and does not make my eyes tired it is ergonomically designed and has an extremely long battery life if you disable the wifi the storage space is much more than anyone can ever need,better than the more expensive kindles
5.0,even though the kindle paperwhite has been touted as the preferred kindle for those of us who just want to use it for reading i think my 6 glarefree one just fine excellent choice for me,i think my 6 glarefree one just fine excellent choice for me

1.0,i have been using a kindle for years now i started with the generation 3 with buttons to turn the page i wondered if i should upgrade but when one died i bought another on ebay i decided i needed to switch to the new kindle when that one stopped working i read alot so it is not terrible that they eventually die well i hate it the font keeps changing at random moments when i touch the screen i thought maybe it was a malfunction but others have had the same experience the button changing of pages works just fine and you never have to worry about fonts changing or other things happening when you dont mean it to back to ebay and a used kindle i goi use the kindle ap on my ipad and touch screens do not have this same problem so it does not have to be this way i prefer a kindle to the ipad but not when im not in control,hate the kindle touch screeen

4.0,definitely a great device does what what it needs to do very well one thing ive noticed is on certain cites gmail it wont let me scroll down in the inbox it also randomly closes out of cites on the internet but will open them back up when you get back on it supports wifi just fine so im assuming this is just because it is ment more as an ereader than an all purpose tablet over all its a great product and does what it needs to do very well,definitely a great device does what what it needs to do

3.0,i love kindles and have purchased some of each of them kindle fire paperwhite as gifts i was very disappointed that this one did not have the ability to listen to my audio books my previous regular kindle had this ability and nothing was mentioned about the audio no longer being available quiet disappointing amazon often offers the ability to purchase the audible version of the book which can be synced no idea why this is offered but cant be used with anything other than the kindle fire which i do not prefer to use for reading,no ability to listen to your audible books

5.0,my husband and i were each given one for christmas were older and only slightly into electronic devices and were dubious at first however this kindle is so easy to use and has wonderful features its easy to order new kindle books and lightweight enough to easily hold up to read in bed were hooked now,love it
4.0,this is a pretty amazing ereaderi really appreciate the fact you can note highlight and comes with a dictionary you can note when you have an observation highlight and review or look up a specific word right then and therethe only drawback is no back lightbut that also equals limited eyestrainit is user friendly and lightweighta great gift,this is a pretty amazing ereader
5.0,very light i use it when taking subway its small so that i can hold it and operate by only one hand reading with kindle my eyes feel much more relaxed than reading in iphone recommend it,recommend it
4.0,its ok although the technology is not mature enough as you will see theres always a lagging when you flip a page or scroll down the web and when the eink refreshes it will always blackout for a second which is quite annoying overall its a good ereader i hope the technology will fix all the problems in the future,good read
4.0,great device battery is fantastic it is small and light weight and perfect for reading outside what do not like though is every time i accidentally touch the page something happens like the menu pops up or i accidentally turn the page kinda annoying,it is good
4.0,i didnt know my wireless password so i spent a lot of time with my wireless company getting it once i had that i had no problem getting mykindle to the point that i could input the free kindle book for may and once i figured out how to turn the pages on the touch screen i had noproblem reading the book i have not had my kindle long enough to give a fair review of it i liked the lightness of it and the fact that i couldchange the font so it was easy to read on the screen i think in the long run i am going to love it and feel the same way as i do my laptopi will wonder how i got along without it,new kindle reader
5.0,exceeds expectations having a general preference for books over computer screens i like the blackandwhite reflectonly screen it is far easier to read than a lightup screen also the capabilities of the device are beyond what i had expected the dictionarywikipedia function is particularly useful i actually prefer this device to those that are much more expensive,i like the blackandwhite

1.0,i received a kindle wkeyboard several years ago as a gift it rapidly became the mostused device i owned because it did everything i wanted and did it efficiently and effectively a model of beautiful simplicity the dualsided page turners made reading using just one hand a breeze a tragic beverage spill recently rendered this device unusable and i was heartbroken that sorrow was increased when i discovered only touchscreen devices are now available having read reviews from numerous customers like myself i believe amazon would be wise to come out with a paperlook reader that has both touch options as well as the manual page turners and cursor toggle until then i guess ill hope for a miraculous recovery for my kindle wkeyboard,golden rule dont fix what isnt broken

4.0,works perfectly it is very easy to read on in the day extremely simple to use battery life is insane the only downside is you cant really read it in dark lighting ive read users bought the case with the flash light built in that should solve my problem i should have just gone with the paper white but the deal for this one was just too good to pass up 45 stars,almost the perfect reader

4.0,i bought this for my mom for her birthday she loves it she is 77 years old and is not very computer savvy but she can work her kindle the only thing was it did not come with a instruction booklet and being in a different state i could not set it up for her but she had a friend do it for her,i bought this for my mom for her birthday

4.0,if i was rating this for me i would give almost a five but i am rating it for a 94 year old that i am letting borrow it the only feature i taught her to use was to turn the pages everything else would confuse her i wish there was a way to turn off some of the features as she just doesnt get it so the older version that wasnt touchscreen may have been easier for her this isnt as user friendly as my ipad but i think after i get used to where everything is it will be great for being in the sun which was why i bought it as my ipad isnt all that great in the sun,it will be great for being in the sun

4.0,order this kindle last night last day of the sale i wasnt totally sold on this one because no light but at 5900 how can you go wrong i almost bought the kindle paper white for 9900 but the 40 difference in price for lighted screen didnt justify the upgrade ,kindle vs paperwhite

4.0,i finally decided to buy a kindle ereader for distraction free reading i am comfortable with the touch interface because that is what you get on kindle app on tablets which i used previously overall i am enjoying reading books on my new entrylevel kindle my three suggestions to amazon for future improvements i i would have preferred a slightly larger kindle more in the paperback form factor perhaps they could have provided a larger screen by narrowing the bezel at the bottom ii i would have liked audio pronunciation of words in the dictionary of course this would require audio functionality and a speaker but that would be a worthwhile addition iii allow use of multiple accounts for sharing within a family my wife has prime membership i dont but to use prime benefits i would have to deregister kindle from my account where i have many books and register with wifes account what a hassle and how unnecessary perhaps amazon can fix this with a future software upgrade,nice and convenient but can be improved

2.0,i purchased the kindle for kids bundle it was delivered promptly   hmm trying to find something else nice to say about iti own a kindle paperwhite and absolutely love it the screen is sharp and bright so naturally i assumed that the kindle sold in the above bundle would be as good or at least close to it nope i kept trying to figure out how to make it brighterit was like reading a 40 year old paperback even under a good reading lamp it was terrible i looked in all the settings and there is no way to adjust it as for it sensing the ambient light all i can say is i tried it in everything from dark to bright lighting and it was terrible plus the clarity of images was no good at alli bought this for a nearly 7 year old to try to make reading more fun but it is so visually unpleasant that i did not even show it to him for fear that it would make him hate reading forever returned it the next day i guess i will have to come up with the money for the paperwhite big disappointment,terrible display quality

1.0,i ordered kindle2 paperwhite on sept 20 2014 11900 it has been nothing but trouble i will probably go back to my kindle one and continue to use itthis kindle 2 paperwhite changes the font size whenever it wants turns the pages whenever it wants making me leaf back through many pages to find out where i was it turns itself off whenever if feels like it there are more problems with it but i just dont feel like sitting here going through them i am going to try to read the 5 books i downloaded to it and then just throw it away the first kindle is wonderful i should have stayed with it if i do get another one i sure hope it is better than the 2 or i might just stay with 1 i am sure most of the kindles are great but as luck would have it i did not get a good one,bad kindle 2 paperwhite
2.0,the absence of directions on how to start using the kindle was really frustrating in addition even going to amazoncoms website on ordering free books for the kindle was frustrating when asking for the device used it did not offer the choice of different kindles or describe how to transfer book content to the kindle adequately,the absence of directions on how to start using the 
1.0,this is a real ripoff it is a stripped down kindle you cant skip chapters you can only go page by page its nowhere what the old kindle 5 way or keyboard were i had it less than five minutes before packing it up and sending it back buy something else,this is a ripoff
4.0,it was for my daughter she seems happy with it,four stars

4.0,this replaces an older kindle the new user interface is very nice i have yet to learn the new document organization on the device i cannot create collections on it directly the only organization seems to be in the cloud,the new user interface is very nice i have yet to learn the new document 
2.0,i bought a kindle a few years ago i had cause to complain about the web browser whenever i downloaded my local newspaper and press article mode it keeps downloading over and over recently when the menu button is depressed it will take a frustratingly long time to appear reading books on it was almost perfect believing the machine was defective i bought a new improved model which promised touch screen facility improved dynamics and most of all an improved web browser boy was i disappointed this machine is far worse than the old one when it comes to web browsing imagine the bookmarks that were downloaded with it from the manufacturers simply dont workit keeps blinking and downloading over and over options in the menu button takes quite a while to appear many times however once again the reading books is quite a pleasure when it comes to reading a book or a down loaded article it works quite well i bought this machine so that i can down load my local news papers to read i am aware of charges to be incurred for certain sights my comparison lies with my computer and tablet where i get most of the important news some companies give a synopsis of certain articles and you are asked to sign in to read more in case of the e reader i am regularly getting the message application error try again if i try again the same message comes up these pages will download perfectly in any of my computers or tablet,kindle 6 touch screen
4.0,i would prefer having a print users manual it is irritating to have to bounce back and forth between the manual and attempts to try instructions from the manual when both are the same gadget otherwise i like the kindle very much,print the manual
2.0,a lot to digest for someone my age74 34 i will try it for a few weeks but i think the kindle that i already own is much easierto use and not nearly as complicatedthanks for asking,a lot to digest for someone my age74 34 
2.0,the device felt cheap to me i have an original kindle that i love and it still works well but they had a deal on this so i thought i might upgrade however i just wasnt thrilled with it i also had spotty wi fi reception where my original worked just fineamazon was great as usual about the return it just wasnt for me maybe the higher version is better i just would not recommend this particular one,returned it
1.0,they sold this kindle to me along with my prime so i could get free books under kindle owners lending librarywell guess what it no longer works and they want 999 a month under a new programscam folks bait and switch which everyone needs to know aboutdo not buy,kindle owners lending library is gone and they want 999 a month now
5.0,the size the weight the screen everythings perfect in this device i love that its as easy on the eyes as a book ive recommended to all my booklover friends,loved it
2.0,when purchased i did not realize it required wifi to contact amazon for book purchasehaving a very hard time accessing xfinity wifi in my current location want to use xfinity because im a comcast customer,no wifi
3.0,im just so frustrated that they decided to put neither speakers nor a headphone jack in this thing the whole device is absolutely incredible so so so nice and then seemingly for no reason they make this incredibly stupid decision to purposefully strip it of any audio capabilities so much for audible and kindle narration being compatible with your own companys device,seriously no audio
1.0,do not by a kindle touch it is the most dreadful ereader you could possibly own nothing on it works properly page turning sucks paging thru your titles sucks it opens books wile trying to turn pages the entire touch interface is glaringly flawedi will no longer buy kindle products i will be using calibre to convert all my titles to epub and move away from kindle,kindle touch a huge step backwards
2.0,like being able to touch page to move on do not like having all the other things highlightsetc that i never use suddenly appear on the page if i move the kindle wrong or accidentally brush it would much prefer prefer such things at the top of the page with buy and home etc to tap like the lighted page though all in all i prefer the way my old kindle works,like being able to touch page to move on
1.0,i was so excited about receiving my kindle i love to read friends of mine have older models and they love it but i feel you should better inform the customer that if they do not have wireless service it cannot be used i called for help and was told i can purchase books to my computer and download them to my kindle was sent instructions and watched your video would not worktotally frustrating the price was great at 5900 until i got wireless installed just to use the kindle it was not worth it not including the adaptor i bought just to charge it i would have paid a higher price to get a kindle that came with the wireless already installed like my friends have totally disappointed,i love to read

3.0,this was very hard to get set up it would be good if the guide book would be in print so you could look at as you go instead of it all being onlineit took several attempts to get everything going almost asked to send it back but now we have it set up and it is working,it would be good if the guide book would be in print so 
2.0,i am not that happy with this model i would have preferred the 4g the wording of builtin wi fi is a little misleading the touch screen interface is not that easy to use requiring reading all the menu items to get started especially to download items to the home screen from archives overall i liked your earlier models much much better but im still using this as i like reading with backlit screens whether the paper white or a tablet even less,i am not that happy with this model
3.0,refurbished kindlelooked brand newtried to update and register the computer do not know what generation it is question asked for me to update and register the computerdo not like touch screens will have to get used to them,do not like touch screens
1.0,it is a disappointment despite buying the case it doesnt stand so you have to hold it like a book okay thats not so bad my biggest problem is that it is not in sync with my other kindle that is if i read on one the other doesnt respond and keep pace so i could be on chapter two on one kindle but only on chapter one on my new kindle this doesnt work for me since i share my third kindle with my husband he plays games and checks face bookim sorry i bought it,it is a disappointment despite buying the case
5.0,i really like this the only thing i would say that is the slightest bit annoying is the lag the screen sometimes has however i know this is a function of the technology as a whole and is not a fault of the design itself,really really loved this
1.0,there is no way an average person can figure out how to use the kindle what happened to easy kindle im trying to find an old version that a 3rd grader could program do you have any of the original version left where you push buttons to turn a page find your books etc i cant even bring up the books i bought on the old system im stuck in the middle of a boring book help,three stars
3.0,i like the 6 kindle very much it was a great price however i think in the future i would upgrade to a lighted screen and wish i had realized how much versatility it would mean to have it when i bought the 6 all in all it is a wonderful additional reading device,i like the 6 kindle very much
4.0,great product once i received it i wished i had purchased the paper white version for easier reading in darker environments but after a couple of hours of use i realized the back light was an overpriced option i love this thing,great purchase over the paperwhite

3.0,am going to return it for a kindle paperwhite if you want to save the 50 thats fine but in the long run youll get a lot more use out of a kindle that has a light in it first thing my wife said the second day she had it was can i read in the dark on this it hasnt been used sinceso id have to say that the kindle itself is of great quality and it does whats advertised but as for user friendliness i just dont see what a kindle without a light will do for most consumers as id assume most people want to read in bed,buy a paperwhite dont bother with this one

2.0,the classic keyboard kindle was their best device by far touch screens are terrible for reading books one accidental touch of the screen and youve turned the page it was so annoying i sent it back and bought a used keyboard one off ebay it would be great if they would at a minimum bring back the buttons on the sides for page turning and allow you to disable the touch screen when reading,touchscreens suck on a kindle

2.0,i have the 2nd generation kindles with the keyboard 3g and have been using it for over 3 years i love it i dont know what i ever did without itfast forward i have two young boys who are both avid readers and so for christmas i bought them the most basic kindle possiblebattery life is horrible for my boys after 34 hours of reading over 3 days they have to recharge this is after wiffi being disconnected if that makes any difference with these kindles which im beginning to think it doesntsigh the original kindles will last weeks on a single charge as long as there is no wifi connected i love this for long plane rides which my family often endures amazon took what had to be the most simple user experience for someone that just wants to be able to read books without having to store all those paper books in their home and made it the most complicated little machine to do so it has so many extras that link back to amazon in some way mostly to purchase books or join programs this is not including ads which are just junk and i would strongly suggest removing from the device if you havent already done so you can do this after you buy them for 20 extra dollars i get that amazon wants to make money and make the device seem in tune with the user over time these features may prove to be useful and with time it will become easier to navigate through the rabbit hole that is the settings area but for now its just an overly complex system to have someone download and read a book i truly wish amazon would come out with something with no extras no free time no google reads no books suggestions no experimental browserjust a device for downloading and reading books more like the original kindle and continue to support it not everyone wants touch screen and multiple options and features at the cost of efficiency and simplicity,disappointed

3.0,i think the kindle will probably meet every expectation if i ever figure how to use it it said instructions inside inside what the machine ok how do i get into the machine by tapping around its face i have found a few things and i have started one really crappy book miss goldsleighs secret  so how do i find how to eliminate a book you dont want i have also just about read another really good one schizophrenic god and while reading it i accidently found how to enlarge the print like i say this might be a pretty good machine if there were written instructions that were supplied with it so until i accidently run it more info ill rate it 3 star,and i have started one really crappy book miss goldsleighs secret

2.0,people have written so many thousands of reviews on kindle that i am going to confine my review to a few key points this is my third kindle i put off buying one for a long time while i treasure real books the practical realities of modern life complete with frequent moves and family and friends around the globe make having 300 books at my fingertips priceless i got my paperwhite model when my original basic kindle died i do like the paperwhite backlighting function what avid reader doesnt swoon at the idea of sneaking a read in bed in the dark without struggling with a flashlight but i do not like the touchscreen for turning pages i am not a luddite i use and appreciate technology but i just do not get the appeal to me a huge part of the appeal of a kindle is that it is small and light i should be able to hold it in one hand an turn the page without lifting a hand with the old models you could apply gentle pressure to the page turn lever on the edge of the device and voila next page now it feels like a work out liftandreachandliftandswipeand no thank you i cant take it i find myself avoiding picking my kindle up because the prospect is so unappealing i am looking for a used or refurbished model amazon now offers one model with a pressure based turn sensor but at 200 you pay for the privilege this kindle has lots of other functions like vocabulary builder and a built in dictionary i dont use those i wish there were a better inventory management system ideally one that would sync with an online index of ones books its a bear to try to organize content if it were not for the pageturning issue id give it a much higher rating it is a pretty neat little device otherwise,regrettably not a page turner
1.0,am not satisfied it is hard to see anything on it,am not satisfied it is hard to see anything on
2.0,one might say i should have done more research but because i also bought the paper white i realized that the screen was very dim most definitely it is one that requires bright light in order to read at night reading during the day posed no problem i wish i could return it but i am out of the country and it would be too expensive,disappointed
5.0,good but if the screen is more larger it is better,small
1.0,i bought this last year and paid 7999 for it the screen is ruined in the same way my 1st kindle was i would not recommend this kindle,2nd kindle with screen failure
1.0,very disappointed that this 6 kindle has no back lighting for reading in bed in the dark had i known this fact before purchase i would never bought it to date all my amazon purchases have been exactly as advertised but this one is not,dissatisfied with 6 kindle
2.0,thats about the only pro i can give this ereader it works you put books on and you read them reading the product description i knew there was no back light for it i knew it was small i knew there was no apps or internet access thats fine i have a nook and laptop and tablet for the additional things i really did want a simple ereader next time ill get something else the only reason i am keeping this one is because it was only 60 and i understand you get what you pay forpros 1 its lightweight 2 its simple 3 the touchscreen is pretty cool 4 and the special offers on my home screen every day keep me updated about new books and productscons 1 glarefree thats a laugh i cant read it in the dark because of no backlight which i knew about but i cant read it during the day because i cant see the screen its nothing but glare from whatever light im using 2 you cant brighten the screen 3 i really dont like how the kindle loads up changes pages or loads new content it blinks and freaks out for a few minutes like its crashing then it straightens itself out 4 it doesnt turn off just the screen goes off 5 in order to get to your user manual and set up instructions you have to set up your kindlewhats the pointall in all i got it because it was the cheapest one and i wanted to be able to use the rest of my christmas money to buy books next time ill spend the extra 40 and wing itor ill go back and get a nook instead,wellit works
3.0,except for the special offers this thing is fantastic it does what its supposed to having ads show up whenever its not in use is an annoyance if id known it was going to do this i wouldnt have bought it but there you go,this thing is fantastic it does what its supposed to
3.0,this kindle came with no operating instructions i am not techno savvy therefore it has taken me awhile to understand this machine i will say that amazon is absolutely amazing with their help they answer immediately and spend as much time with the customer as needed,i will say that amazon is absolutely amazing with their help
3.0,they sent me this one as a replacement for my third one which the screen froze up on the backlit screen is nice for reading in bed so the bedlight doesnt bother your sleeping spouse but not sure i like the touchscreen i was kind of use to the push button to change the page plus the words go clear out to the edge with no margin around them,the backlit screen is nice for reading in bed so the bedlight doesnt bother 
5.0,hello guys go to staplescom for the same kindle they are selling it for 30 after mail in rebate i just purchased one just now hurry offer ends dec 27th look and read the special offer descriptions like if you found this helpful lol btw sorry amazon ,head to staples now better special offer from today till 122714
1.0,found it completely unusable display so dim i cant read unless under strong light customer support told me it is only meant to be used outside in bright sunlight either they are lying or this is the worst designed reader ever there is no brightness adjustment on this model so cant set to be used indoors,so low contrast it is unusable
3.0,i miss the function of changing pages from either side of the screen i also like the larger format i think i just loved my original kindle and dislike change opening page and menu formats different,i also like the larger format

5.0,its been a week of use and i am pretty impressed with the device so far its pretty responsive and transferring files is so easy as wellexcept for the light like the paperwhite this device is perfect for reading i would like amazon to consider screen rotation as a future update though,perfect little reading device except the light 
5.0,its really comfortable looking at the screen much better than pads and i like the dictionary feature just click on a word and it pops up a window of the words meaning and wiki purchasing books is also fast and convenient good product,its really comfortable looking at the screen
3.0,it worked great the first day the next day it started skipping several pages at a time when i tapped to move forward and a hard reboot didnt fix the problem after much time spent with support they finally deleted the book and resent it to me and it is working just fine at the moment very frustrating,it worked great the first day

2.0,the kindle was a gift to replace my previous kindle which died built in obsolesence i guess the new kindle performs its basic function all right but the pages are shorter and its difficult to turn the pages with one hand like the old kindle with buttons on both sides also you often have to swipe the screen multiple times to turn the page not like my iphone, the new kindle performs its basic function all right but the pages are shorter and its difficult to turn the pages with one

3.0,i really liked this kindle i found it easy to use and it didnt take me long to figure it out especially when this is the first ereader i have ever purchased unfortunately i am returning it because i cant adjust its brightness i called amazon and they told me that the kindle i got was an older touchscreen model and that it didnt come with the adjustable light feature i paid 5900 and they told me if i bought the 7900 one would include the adjustable background lighting i thought i was getting the same one as the 7900 and that it was on sale this was very misleading and disappointing now i have to pay a return shipping cost which i feel is unfair because they failed to mention that i was purchasing an older model even the girl helping me was confused until a supervisor told her that the kindle that were sold for 5900 were the older models amazon should have disclosed this in their advertisement,misleading when you buy the 5900 kindle

1.0,this device is a piece of junk it should not be sold i had a very early kindle with a physical key board and speaker it died and i was offered this with a small discount as a replacement as my original kindle was 5 plus years old i regret paying even 40 for it first i already have a big investment in audible books which i love however i was not told that this piece of junk has no speaker thus my audible books are no good to me second this device is much harder to hold than the earlier models if your fingers just slightly brush the left side of the screen you go to the preceding page and if you happen to touch the right side then you go forward this is a huge step backwards from the early kindles where you had to touch an actual real button to move back and forth third this device is far less intuitive to navigate that the early models again it is vastly poorly engineered should have never been released it has badly damaged the brand,what a pieve of junk
5.0,great reader,best ebook reader

1.0,this is the third kindle ive had none have lasted a full year all three have had the same problem all of a sudden for no discernible reason the bottom half of the screen freezes on whatever happened to be on screen at the time either an ad or text and it wont clear it wont go away ive tried everything to fix it ok i tried everything to fix the first two this one im not even bothering with it its trash im not buying anymore my dil has a nook that shes had for years with no problem im off to look at getting one of my own so disappointed but with cheap imported chinese garbage i dont know why id expect these things to actually last more than a few months,third one to die in just under 2 years

5.0,good product,five stars
3.0,heres the thing this might be fine for someone who reads a bit or a kid who wants a new toy but when i purchase a ereader it should be good at doing the one thing i purchase it for readingif i wanted a tablet id use my ipad or get a kindle fireperhaps they should create a new reader called the bookworm just for us obsessive readers maybe a simple audiobook reader for those into audio or text to voice called the storyteller when you make an entry level item that tries to do everything it often does nothing really wellannoying that you cant have buttons anymore without a lit screen i work on computers all day and have a touchscreen that is not needed to enjoy reading a book i am forever touching the screen and changing pages accidentally if someone wants to swipetouch to page turn why go backward i can do that with a real book or ipadtablet there could easily be a toggle to turn off the touchscreen as an avid reader of 34 books per week here are my requirements in a reader no touchscreen or toggle touchscreen to avoid accidental page turns if you must have a touchscreen tapping anywhere on the screen should advance pages how often do you go back honestly going backward should be out of the way button say at the top i shouldnt have to swipe to page turn on an ereader or app dude its an ereader not a real book changing pages is the thing most likely to interrupt the flow of a story especially when i accidentally backs wipe or highlight something im a reader not a student highlighting is unneeded for my purposes highlighting and other functions should never be accidentally triggered browsing and purchasing new books should be possible from any reader or app i i am looking at you ipad kindle app should not have to get a lit screen to get standard features like buttons should be able to read in the sun and with uv sunglasses,do the designers read with a kindle or just play with it different kindles for different audiences

1.0,terrible customer service amazon i purchased 3 kindles on black friday for three of my kids for christmas on christmas morning one of the touchscreens did not work we tried trouble shooting and nothing worked after a month of attempting to contact amazon to get a replacement i was sent a refurbished kindle i purchased a brand new defective kindle and after a month of begging was sent a refurbished kindle to replace it,terrible customer service amazon
3.0,i ordered the 6 kindle so that i could read outside in the sun i have a kindle fire and it is impossible to read it anywhere but inside perhaps i am comparing the 6 to the fire but it seems a little flimsy and cheaply made i also ordered the case to go along with it and it is not very sturdy it does suit the purpose and is an easy read in the sun i was pleased that all of my books transferred from the fire to the 6 easily i have not tried to download any new reading material but the process seems similar to the firehope it works as well overall i would say it is okay if all you want to do is read outside there is no backlight so you wont be able to read at night in a dark room to get that feature you will have to spend more money on the paper white kindle that will be released soon,ok if all you want to do is read outside with no glare
1.0,i have not really got to use it a lot but since this is a christmas present from santa to my 7 year old the first thing i was asked to do is to put the active contents on eg crossword games and chess games but to my frustration i didnt get to complete the task in 5 mintues the research that followed told me that this version does not support active contents which really puzzled me why crossword and chess are really educational and good for a break from reading i would think i simply dont understand why this functionality is taken away now i ended up giving my paperwhite to my kid and im taking over this inferior product not happy at all if it were not from santa i would definitely have returned it,crossword and chess are really educational and good for a break from reading
5.0,i have my old kindle can i put my old books on the new one how can i put the right time on the kindle,five stars
3.0,i dont like it as well as my first kindle which was also the lowest priced one all i need since i only read library books the old had a cover which was part of the device this one requires you to buy one my old one opened to the home page or the page of the book i was reading this one opens to ads which apparently i can only get off the device if i pay 15 dont want to pay not to use a feature so ill hope i dont order anything by accident old one had a slightly larger actual screen as i recall and an actual button at the bottom which you pushed for the home page this one does not the one problem i seem to have with either is that if you accidentally skip pages you dont know where you were and theres no way to get back except to go back one page at a time until you recognize something thats a rather tedious process wish the pages were numbered rather listed on one side as a percent of the book read and whatever that number on the left is despite my comments i do like having a kindle as im a very fast reader and this way i can actually not worry about finishing a book before i get home to get another,likes and dislikes
5.0,nice upgrade to my original kindle with the keyboard easy to use syncs quickly with my other kindle,five stars
1.0,do not buy the kids kindle bundle as a gift it appears to be a sad bait and switch offeri bought the kids kindle bundle as a birthday gift for my little granddaughter one of the things i particularly liked about this package gift was that it included twoyears insurance coverage against issues that might happen to a kids first electronic device and not just insurance against device defects but there is a catch i am outragedon other amazon electronic products the insurance is activated as soon as the product is shipped to the buyer in the case of a kids kindle bundle however the insurance can only be activated after the device is connected to an amazon account all this must occur within a 30da period or else amazon does not back its deal even though the insurance coverage already had been paid for in the kids kindle packagetheir solution take the kindle away from the child mail it back for credit and start all over not much of a happy birthday to a little child she loves using her kindle and is so proud of it that we can only hope it comes to no harm if it does it certainly will be replaced with a device from a different producer,no gramma do not buy the kids kindle bundle as a gift

1.0,i have owned a kindle keyboard for years now and love it my husband would like a kindle for christmas i am shocked to find that i can not buy him a kindle without a touch screen i decided to go to best buy to see these newer kindles the touch screen stinks for reading this device is cheaply made plastic and far inferior to kindles of previous generations kindle is now off the gift list hope my old kindle keeps going because i would never want this pos,amazon ruins kindle

2.0,i assumed the 6 meant the size of the screen not the entire kindle was disappointed to find the reading area so small i also dont like that there is no backlight you can only read if you are in a lighted roomno late night reads without waking anyone up i do like the ease of enlarging the print and turning the page with just a tap of the finger instead of a swipe,was disappointed to find the reading area so small

4.0,i like this item its very handy and fits in all of my handbags the only thing i do not like about it is that the display is a bit dark i cannot find any brightness controls on the device so i had to purchase a clip on light to go with it,great device but a bit dim in the display
5.0,great device,five stars
3.0,it was fine however i probably should have went for the fire model which has more features for 20 more costsotherwise i am reasonably satisfied except for not being able to adjust the screen brightness for daylight reading,it was fine however
4.0,i like the functions but it feels too much like a toy i feel that reading is a serious activity but this kindle kind of makes it feel like you are playing video game i loved the original kindle with keyboard mine broke after a few years the screen went bad after i took it hiking otherwise i would not have replaced it the touch screen of this new kindle is good but i would make the sensitive area smaller say leave an insensitive margin in the normal reading mode to reduce unintended page turning,good functions but feels like a toy 
3.0,lightweight easy to use i miss having a background light so if you are used to that you might want to go up to paperwhite despite the extra cost moves a little slow between screens very basic but perfect for travel and reading outside if you have the money do paperwhite instead,very basic but functional

2.0,i often use my smartphone to read books with a 56 screen most smartphones are great for this purpose now and i use a program called screen filter to significantly darken my phone screen beyond its typical minimum brightness this isnt a bad solution however the phones screen is still a little brighter than id like but any darker and it would become difficult to readid read about the paperwhites back light and it sounded like thatd be a great solution a very subtle back light i could use and maintain easy readability even though the device is much slower and less responsive than a phone and much physically larger and has no physical buttons that you can use to turn pages as you can with a phones volume buttons i thought it would be worth while for the back lightwhen amazon had their prime day sale more like prime day fail am i rite guys i grabbed a kindle that id been considering for some time the way they set up the sale you are expected to hurry and buy without thinking and without looking at the product but id already considered it and knew i wanted one so the price seemed like a great opportunity unfortunately amazon removed the single killerfeature that this thing had and i was unawarebuying books on kindle can save you money even though many prefer the physical books keep in mind you do not own ebooks and there have been several instances of amazon taking away peoples books from their devices and removing their accounts such as the instance of linn nygaard amazon reminded users that they do not own ebooks they purchase but that they only have a license to view them that amazon can revoke at any time and theyve done so historically without any explanation to the users and in many cases without any potential recoursethis device would probably be nice for reading books outside for my purposes unfortunately its inferior to a mobile phone in every way,no backlight not a great replacement for reading on smartphone at night

3.0,i bought the kindle to replace my physical books however from day one i realized that the default brightness of the screen in ambient light is very poor compared to a paper book the kindle requires quite a lot of ambient light to be easily readable is there any comparison to what the brightness levels are compared to the paper i know printing paper have brightness standards and that plays a very important role in how visible the print is in ambient light the screen is almost grey and not white as i would have liked it to be hopefully future versions of kindle will fix this brightness and improve readability in limited light,terrible brightness compared to paper

2.0,this is a far inferior product to my previous kindle there is no button on the device to press to take me back to the home screen there is no connection for a case that comes with a built in light and of course there is no option for backlight i am extremely disappointed with amazons design for the new generation kindle dont buy it unless you honestly can afford only the cheap option because thats what this is its a cheap piece of ,inferior design

3.0,purchased the new kindle as my old one quit working and used it all the time i have 2 issues 1 books are now stored in a cloud and are no longer seperated by archived and unread so have to search through 165 books to find the books i have not read 2 tried to read a new book while camping and due to no wifiinternet access could not retrive from cloud so no book for 4 days only suggestion from kindle was to check on my old kindle to see which books were not archived if i could do that would not have needed a new one,cloud not alwats best option
4.0,great screen,four stars
3.0,i like it for readingno glare screen so you can read for hours it also has dictionary installed and will be up automatically when you select a wordi just hate the kindle store when access from kindle it doesnt show different genres of kindle books that i might like just because i bought one or two romance novels doesnt means that would all i ever want to read i still prefer selfhelp books but those nearly never cameup in my search in kindle store i am also not able to choose that category when looking for booksi look for kindle books and buy them from my laptop,love the kindle hate the kindle store

2.0,cold weather equals not working also as an aside what is up with the random rescaling of the fonts im a bit annoyed i bought two books to read and i did get through the first one so its not that hard to deal with the occasional rescaling of font size though thats annoying but on my second night on the porch here in michigan its about 20 degrees which is way above my cold point but the dang thing literally froze up if i bring it in the house it reacts again so i dont think this unit is defective but i didnt get touch gloves for christmas to hang out in the house i also worry about dropping it as i like to drop my paperbacks at my convenience i guess im glad i have it i didnt buy it when i traveled overseas this little gentle thing is ok but i guess im confirmed in my love of used book stores shucks though i like having cheap internet books handy i will certainly use this especially until i finish this book but im rather pissed off that i cant use it outside in winter cold weather,im a bit annoyed i bought two books to read and i did

5.0,i was told the instructions come with it nope you have to know how to use a kindle in order to learn how to use it dumb huh not me i have a college degreeand i am a pro photoshop wizard but no ereader knowledge worth the struggle but what of what of the sheer ingenious of this ereader blew me away i have downloaded free books from bookbub highly rated to my pc then i read howto download my entire folder of my ebooks to my kindle in a snap or a choice of downloading only one at a time but why would ya lol cause this great gizmo can hold a bizillion my poor aching hands dont protest at all to this light lighter than a paperback easy to use enjoy kindle i had to read with a light on before tis no big deal to not have the paperwhite and this deal was irresistable love my kindle,finding the howto worth it

1.0,i cant rate it because i couldnt charge it it was a gift i wanted to download a book for the recipient i gave it away probably wasted 60 as the recipient is not computer savvy cant see why they would be able to charge it if i could not instructions are on the device which wont charge,no instructions device kindle wont charge

4.0,i had a kindle with the keyboard at the bottom so im still learning to use the touch screen i wouldnt be without my new kindle even though my fingers go to the right edge and left edge to turn pages yet i only have to unlearn that and get used to the swiping for page turns the reading and lack of glare are excellent and its a little lighterthanks for a great product,the reading and lack of glare are excellent and its a little lighter
5.0,excellent ,five stars
4.0,it has an add on the screen unless you pay money to have it turned on this is a add subsidized device i dont mind it but i hope it does not cause screen burn in its a great device i am still getting used to touching the screen in the right places but its not too bad if i dont use it in a while i have trouble remembering how to get main menu up books with lighter or pencil pictures or drawings like the heads first oreilly books dont display well but if you have an issue just return the book to amazon all the negatives aside its great its easier to read on here than a regular book good text spacing and adjustable font size its cheap so i am not worried about it getting stoleni will say the cover for it is really expensive you might want to get a higher version which has more covers available at lower cost for like 10 20 more i could have gotten a better kindle and a really cool cover instead of a black one the black one i have is nice but its basic plan ahead,good but make sure this is the one you want

4.0,good device but i am wondering how to reboot this kindle if left in the heat too long my other kindle was able to do this because it had a push button for the off switch but this new kindle has a button on the screen which wont help me if it is fried but a good read anyway,good read

5.0,user friendly,five stars
3.0,the screen is a little small i dont like the fact that you can not turn it off it is very hard to access the screen to change things because you have to carefully touch just the bare minimum outside of the screen my 3rd kindle decided to die i bought this one thinking that it would be simpler and maybe last more than a year but i am disappointed with my decision,not as good as the fire version

1.0,bloody awful kindle too difficult to control virtually impossible to change font size without a degree in computerswhy do geeks continue to develop items that can only be understood by geeksif there was an alternative item available with the original specifications i would throw this in the rubbishbin and buy it,bloody awful
5.0,great product,five stars
5.0,i have the worst concentration and i hate reading i forced myself in buying one of these so i had no excuse to avoid reading and honestly its the best thing ive done in a while top selling points for me is that it totally eliminates any distraction and its very easy on the eyes as oposed to staring a light bulb all day any device you can write notes word wise and xray i cant leave home without it thats how bad i like reading now,i have the worst concentration and i hate reading
5.0,great product,very nice
2.0,i paid 4999 for this model its good for this particular price after using it for a long while id say that i wouldnt pay 7999 for it its rather difficult to read if you dont have very sufficient lighting and i find the contrast on the screen varies the font on the upper part of the screen is darker than the bottom part which can be annoying also dont expect the edges of the fonts to be sharp and clear you will be disappointed its a budget reader,if you have a tight budget
5.0,enjoying this,enjoying the kindle

5.0,great product,five stars
4.0,bought this to read in the sun and it is fine for that no frills but dont need them as i only use it to read outside the only reason i rated it 4 was because it does not automatically sync with my kindle fire hd which i use the most i have to manually sync it sometimes several times before it goes to the most current page read, this to read in the sun and it is fine for that
5.0,i love it,i love it
1.0,none of the kindle ereaders support audio anymore unlike the older versions which supported audible audio books and mp3 now one is forced to buy a tablet to listen to audio books sadly many people including myself find tablets inferior to readers for actual reading tablet display creates far greater eye strain than eink,no audio support
5.0,nice display,five stars
3.0,i wanted an ebook not a damn complicated pos some damn techno geek had to go and make it harder to use inadvertantly touch the screen and you loose your page or bring up some useless info you dont need or want if there was a way to bring my old one back from the dead i would not happy with it,or bring up some useless info you dont need or want
5.0,easy to use,love my christmas present
4.0,much easier to use then the button navigation kindle small lightweight only issue so far is that none of the advertised lighted cases for a kindle touch fit this newest version i have returned two cases so far and checked a few stores no luck yet there are no contact points on the back of the kindle and therefore the case needs to have its own power source,kindle better than button version
3.0,it takes me forever to find my library i tap the screen to advance the screen because swiping screws everything up im really confused with how to use the device i spend more time fiddling than reading i do like the large print feature when i can figure it out and then to apply using it on the next book i admit im not an uptodate techy i still live in a cave,i do like the large print feature
3.0,i bought this kindle for an elderly friend who had been using a prior version which had died this kindle doesnt offer the home page and menu like the old one so it is harder for her to manage her books she needed large print the largest is too big with too few words on the page however the next to largest is a bit too smallis going to take some adjustments, this kindle doesnt offer the home page and menu like the old one so it is harder for her 
5.0,great product long lasting battery clear and easy to read,good value great price

1.0,i am very disappointed in this kindle reader my other one couldnt hold a charge after a couple of years so i ordered this one the old one was back lit this is not not good for reading in bed or on n aircraft i hate it why do solid return customers get a lower quality new kindle reader,not happy at all
1.0,buyer beware amazon adds a default yearly charge to your amazon account kindle subscription fee simply for using the kindle unless you opt out im unaware of any other technology company that does this with their devices i feel cheated by a company ive used for years liked and trusted,buyer beware
1.0,i will not buy a kindle again i have the kindle 6 blk i purchased it in march and it pooped out in august the screen imprint froze onto the screen they sent me a new one and alas it has pooped out again i charge it and it says it isnt charged and it wont find my network even though i can get onto internet on computer fine so i had to download my books via cable i also restarted the kindle 3 times and turned it off for the night i also charged it for 3 hours that was fine with me but it wont charge so i am screwedi called amazon and they had me turn off my routerwhich doesnt make sense since my computer gets onto internet fine she had me turn off kindle and now i cant get it to turn back on they are sending me a new charger although i dont know how that will fix the problem with it not recognizing my network also my old charger worked fine 2 weeks agoi will try the new charger but am fed up with the kindle productwill try nook nowvery discourged,only lasted me 5 months 2 times
1.0,product failed in a few months one of two kindles that failed in a month were on a world tour and now have no kindle device no access to library except via phone app terrible experience with customer service hours on the phone refusal to ship replacements overseas lame and false excuses given from my experience these are not good products,bad experience with product and service
1.0,it arrived with no light icon on the toolbar and after a lot of haggling with amazon reps in what sounded like the phillipines this was a replacement for a kindle paperwhite that broke down after 15 months they tried to sell me one for 59 proclaiming this was a 40 discount the confirmation receipt indicated this was for a refurbished rather than a new kindle something not disclosed during my interaction with the reps the confirmation arrived simultaneously with an amazon offer for a new kindle for 59 it took 112 hours of call time to finally arrange for the return of the on its way refurbished model for the new reader when the reader arrived it lacked the lighting icon meaning i have no way to change the backlighting poor service all around,shame on you amazon outsourced customer service
3.0,received my new kindle yesterday and yes it is very easy on the eyes however i deducted 2 stars because after paying for an ad free kindle i still can not change the screensaver and can not change the order of my books the way i want them to appear im really unhappy with that,kindle 6 glare free touchscreen
1.0,this would have been my first kindle however i was sorely disappointed the screen was so dark that i needed more light to read than i do with a regular bookim not eager enough for a kindle to spend 119 for the paper white,i was sorely disappointed the screen was so dark that i needed

2.0,the version of kindle is the thickest among all generations of kindle my friend has the previous generation which is with buttons on each side of the kindle that one is the lightest weight the processor is little faster but a touchscreen doesnt really make this generation more advanced i dont recommend this generation with 79 regular price if you really want it get it with 49 holiday sales other ereader like kindle paperwhite or voyage are better in term of weight and function,heavy weight than any kindle generations
3.0,i love it,3
3.0,i was a little disappointed with this kindle the screen is not very well lit and theres no setting to make it brighter i have not used it outside yet i also dont like these new updates and the quantity of them trying to move a book off the device and to the carousel is unclear im afraid im going to erase it due to the options giving,screen is too dark im glad i only paid 49

2.0,hard to read home page titles titles in prose much better,titles on home page
1.0,hated it sent it back in exchange for a paperwhite it was hard to read and i definitely was going crazy within the first day the paperwhite is much much better for not much of a price difference,if you like squinting this is the kindle for you
3.0,works well but doesnt receive all kindle books no color,three stars
1.0,the worst experience with amazon ever i purchased first kindle for my young reader received as usual very slow interface and touching the screen was xray as best i can describe it called customer service i was explained that this was a defective item and issued pre placement replacement had exact same problem returned both within a month but never was issued my refund bc i was issued a replacement 80 to garbage i am reconsidering renewing my amazon subscription very disappointed worst customer service,worst experience with amazon poor product and awful customer service
1.0,disliked the new kindle after my analogue kindle screen screen cracked i logically purchased this new touchscreen modelthe touch screen features were not a sufficient trade off for the added heft of the device i found the uneven backlight distractingthe kobo is much better for around the same price its thinner lighter and more elegant design i do miss the some of the network feature and since amazon purchased goodreads that is no longer available on the kobo,heavy bulky went with a kobo
5.0,the kindle 6 glarefree touchscreen is better than i had hoped now instead of packing bulky books this reader takes up hardly any space and is very easy to use i also love that it stays charged for days,small reader packs a huge punch

3.0,i am now on my 4th kindle after experiencing the dreaded screen freeze again you might wonder why i keep buying this device given the lack of durability the answer is simple this is the only ereader that does not have a backlit screen i am an avid reader for work and pleasure and cannot force my eyes to do more screen time and the kindle really does replicate reading paper thats why i love my kindle it is almost constantly within my reach and usually in my handssadly the nonbacklit kindle is now a touchscreen while this is good for highlights etc i am constantly having to turn it on and off to keep from having multiple unintentional page turns i will adapt to this change but i have written this review to talk about the new interfacei have always appreciated that the kindle comes with a cloud for archived items and that i can access my content from my computer my tablet my phone and my kindle the portability is wonderfulhowever on my kindle i need to organize my current reading which is large because i use it for reference works too on the device this is now difficult and awkward i can see my previous collections in the cloud but why cant i simply move them to the device having to search for and then move each title individually is tedious and frustrating and really shouldnt become on amazon get it together i would be happy as a power user of your product to help you make this better please,love my kindle but 6th gen interface needs improvement
3.0,get the paperwhite instead so you can still read at night,three stars
1.0,pro very portable and easy to operate screen is perfect for reading in any type of lighting battery life is great much lighter that carrying hard copycon they do not disclose that some ebooks will not work i bought a textbook about c programming that works on my pc based kindle application but does not work with the kindle reader it could be because of the lack of color but it does not state why this was the first book i tried to read and i was very disappointed to see it fail compatibility at this point i still dont know for sure which books are compatible until after i buy it not cool the readers page numbers are not synced with the books page numbers that results in the book index becoming almost uselessupdate despite what they claim there is no compatibility information on textbooks at the time you buy them to date not a single textbook has worked on this device i do not recommend for students waste of money,warning many ebooks do not work with the reader
4.0,i love kindle i love amazon the only reason that i did not give this kindle 5 stars is due to the following no cases are available with the built in light my husband and i ordered two of these believing them to be back lit they are not my husband doesnt care so much about a case with a light i do i read in low light or in places where more than your average room light will simply not due the cases that are currently available have these cheap clip on lights cant do it the old kindle i have now has a case with a built in light im in love yet alas it is getting old and has dimdark spots showing up on the screen this makes me sad sad sad in closing i have to send this kindle back for a paper white which is more expensive yet i have to believe it will be worth it in the long run amazon you come out with a new kindle without a light make positive you have a case with a built in light ready to go in fact sell them together,i love kindle i love amazon

3.0,this was a replacement for my old kindle keyboard reader and it is pretty disappointing it feels so cheap like hollow hard plastic it is very thick too so i cant fit it in pockets i used to fit my older kindle im also disappointed that amazon has clamped down so hard on jailbreaking there are a couple tiny things id love to change and none of them have to do with stealing books all i want to do is add my own custom screensavers and more importantly adjust the page turn touch zones on the screen i have a habit of putting my thumb squarely onto the screen to hold the kindle and this causes all kinds of menus to pop up on this thing it would be fine if i could resize the page turn touch zones id gladly pay the extra 20 to remove ads if only i could load my own screensavers and make some interface tweaks,seems like a downgrade
2.0,i had to purchase this item with an applied credit from customer service i had a generation 3 with a keyboard and interenet access my previous kindle was working well until amazon told me to do an upgrade and i got a message that said kindle needs repair the technical department couldnt give me a fix to get it working again so i had to spend money to get a new one to get the kindle like i had i would have had to spend 150 and also buy a cover after customer service gave me a creditit is ok if you are starting out with this kindle and hadnt used one of the nicer ones in hindsight i maybe would have gotten a paperwhite so i can read in the dark but then i would have had to spend more as customer service wouldnt give me more credit and i really didnt need a new kindle except for the upgrade making my old kindle unusuablei also had some free word games on my kindle that i cannot find in the kindle store so cannot put them on my new kindle i am going to try to research to see if i can find the games on the amazon websight and try to load them but havent gotten that far yeti also had ahigh quality leather cover with a light which worked well when i wanted to read at night now i have a 30 cover which does not have a light and cannot read in the dark the quality of the cover i received is far below what i had,a forced puchase for a kindle replacement

3.0,allows access to wikipedia access just out of the package you have to make the effort to set parental controls i was looking for a safe kid friendly device so my kiddo could read lots of good books without the hassle of setting up parental controls yes wikipedia contains lots and lots of trashy images i do not want my young child exposed to,still requires you to set up parental controls else your child can stumble upon adult content

3.0,this is my first ereader and im still getting acquainted with it i find it very easy to read and i like the pageturning feature a lot i also like the size and weight like a feather and i will really love it when i travel i find it very awkward to turn off and im never certain its really off i would like to be able to make the screen a bit brighter but i cant find that feature anywhere i particularly value the ability to download books i live a distance from any book store and the downloads happen in a flash i am not crazy about the popup ads for books and other products and i find it difficult to get rid of them so i can actually read my book i am very happy to have an electronic gadget thats dedicated to just one purpose reading i guess my jurys still out,i find it very easy to read

4.0,i really enjoy this reader its light weight easy to hold and carry as apposed to my ipad great to put in my purse to read on the go i would have given it 5 stars if it had back lighting one of my main reason for purchasing the reader is so i can read in bed but now i have to purchase a clip light to be able to do that i had read a couple reviews that said there wasnt back light but i just assumed they were wrong they werent,great reader but
5.0,i purchased this version after i cracked the screen on my kindle keyboard i didnt want to part with it but i thought this would be the most economical option instead of replacing the screen i was pleasantly surprised how much i loved this new version although its quite smaller than the kindle keyboard its compact enough to fit easily into my purse without taking up too much space i also love that you can read with one hand and not have to put much energy in changing the pages as lazy as that sounds the convenience is nice,i was pleasantly surprised how much i loved this new version
3.0,i was disappointed that at this generation level it would not be back lit or have a way to read in the darkalso there is no cover with a light i can buy that works correct with this kindle they are too smalleven amazon couldnt help so i feel it was kinda of a waste of money as i cant read it at night unless i have another light source on,disapointed
2.0,i wish i hadnt purchased this my first kindle was the keyboard version i own a kindle fire now but i thought i wanted the easyontheeyes screen so such fond memories i had of my first kindle this current kindle 6 glare free touchscreendoesnt deserve the name theyve now made it so light that it feels cheap and puny why do people think they have to keep messing with something that was fine to begin with i loved my keyboard kindleeasy to understand easy to operate i didnt realize how wonderful it was to push a button and actually get a response this touchscreen has nearly made me swear sometimes i touch here i touch therenothing or worse its completely what i didnt want id send it back but frankly its more trouble than its worth,why do people think they have to keep messing with something that was fine to begin with

2.0,this was a gift from well meaning children unfortunately i read at night and prefer a screen with a back lit option also has less features than other readers ive used no ability to play games on screen it is small and light and will work for travel but will not be used for regular reading,ok for vacation use

3.0,it is only black and white which is not a problem but i cannot find any way to change the contrast this makes it difficult to read at times and you have to hold it at a specific angle for easy reading,no glare but very little contrast

1.0,i am disappointed with this product when i got it i loved the size and how nice and easy it is for reading however when i downloaded my first text book it wont work so if you buying to read regular books its awesome if you buy it thinking that you will read text books forget it it wont work so know i have to read my textbooks from school on my cell phone app till the my kindle fire arrived here after sept 30,i am disappointed with this product
5.0,great love it,third kindle great again
1.0,in general it is a bad experience 1 it shows advertising on some screens and on the screensaver unless you pay more to remove them 2 you can only lend a book that the publisher allows lending when it happens amazon only allows you to lend a book once and neve again conclusion if you are trying to avoid bright electronic light do not care for some advertisement and do not plan to share your books so kindle is for you,works as promised but bad experience
5.0,amazing reader,great

2.0,one of those things where i didnt read before purchasing owning a kindle fire and an ipad i brought the ereader for that purpose only i did not realize that regarding settings beside the font size there is no setting for the lightness i read a lot in bed so i didnt realize the kindle does not have a back light so i now find myself having to purchase a clip on light for the kindle the size is perfect and light weight i also brought it recently for 5900 so i wont send back its always good to read before purchasing so i definitely cant blame amazon on this one just disappointed,the size is perfect and light weight

1.0,im not buying any more of these contraptionsthey dissolve like alka seltzer tablets they only seem to last a year or two i had my nextolder version of this one freeze on me twice and that was my second one bought last september the first one i bought in march 2011 so this is my third one i dont buy the claims of how many books they hold especially since i only have a couple hundred titles and i think thats why the second one froze on meindigestion and one thing this one is missing is a manual of some sort i had to stumble my way through this one trialanderror before i could access the book i had tried to download to kindle numbah two when it froze so i came here for another download of the book to this new one when it showed up they also really need a manual so you know which part of the screen you touch to get what result,i dont know but what im better off with paper books
3.0,i dont often write reviews but i must say how disappointed that the manufacturer placed the power button on the bottom of this reader who doesnt like to prop up their reader against a surface to read hands free well i guess the product designer whenever you try to prop the device put it on your lap and rest against your knees it turns the device off grrrr,but i must say how disappointed that the manufacturer placed the power button on the

5.0,i was reluctant to make the switch to an ereader but i had already started to use the kindle app for books on my phone and tablet because it was just so easy as a person like many others that doesnt like to stare at a screen like that for a long period of time but still wanted the convenience of an ereader i thought i would give this a try i absolutely love it the battery lasts forever you can hold it in one hand in fact it easily fits in my inside coat pockets for taking it on the go i still read plenty of hardback books but i must say when im reading a book on this i get through it a lot faster partially because its so portable as for the screen reading on this feels just like reading from a book because theres no back light and the technology doesnt require the image to refresh continuously its truly a still image so its easier on the eyes highly recommended enjoy,shouldve purchased this sooner

3.0,while a good value this is the barebones kindle my biggest issue with it is the screen is not backlit so you cant read it in the dark or in low light its worth the extra money to spring for the kindle fire which has a lot more features and a backlit screen the nice thing about this model is its tiny lightweight size if you are only going to use your kindle for reading where there is light then this is a decent economical choice,while a good value this is the barebones kindle

3.0,a little more boxy than i anticipated my old one was more sleak so this seems like a step back i am also disappointed that kindle has not found a good way of dealing with pdf files by now software has been available for years to reflow text but amazon has not incorporated itthe ads are really bothersome and 20 to avoid them is price gougingthat being said it is still the best way to take a mass of reading with you and read it anywhere including bright sunlight the resolution on the screen is very good for reading and the speed is as fast as any paper book so i am still happy i got it,i expected a bit more but i will take it

5.0,what a great epic work hard to read but the descriptions of the era or the battle of waterloo etc are just fantastic i could have gone without the description of the convent and the nuns though as in other classics those descriptions take a bigger part of the book compered to the actual plot overall a great book by a great author,what a great epic work
2.0,i am not a fan of this ereader at all and im surprised by all the positive reviews its so basic im not sure what the point is for people who are used to backlit lcd screens that would be all of us i think this kindle is way too dim and there is no way to increase the brightness in the old days when we read paperbased material all the time this would have been fine but now that i have a smartphone laptop and tablet with backlit screens this kindle feels oldfashioned and inconvenienti no longer need or have extra reading lamps for my other reading there is also some shadowing when you turn the page which doesnt happen if you use the kindle app on a tablet the screen is really small too in its favor its lightweight battery life is supposed to be long since it is not lighting up anything thats easy to understand and it should be glarefree in direct sunlight so as a backup travel ereader when you go to the beach this is ok but i wouldnt recommend it for anything else,very disappointing

1.0,i never knew that this device does not have a light on screen i thought although it is black and white the screen should be brighter like cellphone where you can read and see without lights on this device you have to turn on the light and read under the light just like reading the ordinary books,the screen should be brighter like cellphone where you can read and see without lights 
2.0,as usual they took a great technological idea and made it worse youre stuck using wifi whether or not you want to or can the navigation system is much more inconvenient than with the first generation kindles they have taken the standard road of retail technology and have told the purchaser to take it the way we want you to take it or bugger off,very disappointing
2.0,sadly i am sending this backthank you amazon for letting me do this i have had three kindles but i just dont like the feel of this one i have a keyboard kindle which my husband has inherited and frankly its better ive had this for about 2 months have used it and tried to learn to like it but it isnt as easy to use or as intuitive as i am used to im ordering a paperwhite and i am hoping that i like it betterat least i will be able to read in the dark now,returning kindle 3 waiting for paperwhite 4

5.0,perfect gift for a reader especially a grandchild there are so many free books on the kindle site for children plus many more books at very reasonable prices,a great product
2.0,this product was a huge disappointment this is my second kindle my first was a kindle keyboard which i cant say enough good things about but the screen froze on mine and my husbands two days apart so i had to replace after much research and talking to amazon i ordered two the 6 glare free kindles for myself and one for my husband expecting the same type of kindle with the same ease of use that is not what i havethis model is not user friendly no simple button to push to get back to home change font and to find the books you have available to read it is necessary to drag down bar from top for my kindle keyboard i was able to order a cover with a built in light to read when light is not perfect not on this model if you want a light it is separate and attaches to the cover one more things to handlei gave this two stars and that is being generous,not like the first kindle produced
4.0,it is a great product its portable easytouse enogh memory for a lifetime of readings it would be ideal if it had light to use it at night or in the dark,it is a great product its portable

1.0,when i change page to next the screen ripples severely every time its very disturbing and i can not concentrate the contentsive really disappointed,ive really disappointed
4.0,absolutely great just wish you could turn the page on the left alsothat way you dont always have to hold it in your right hand otherwise a super device,love it
4.0,power consumption not as advertised but still better than ipad or other pads clarity is unbeatable in that sense this is the ereader for serious readers,power consumption not as advertised but still better than ipad or other pads
1.0,i just do not like it it is just not for me it only has one page at a time and is very sensitive to the touch so when you are reading the book and you touch it somewhere else all other options pop up on the page that you are reading also i am left handed so it is hard to hold even sideways because if you are a lefty they do not have a big section to hold on to also you have to keep constantly changing pages because they only offer one page at a time which makes it hard for lefties so all in all no i do not like it at all,i do not like it at all
5.0,read all the time dont have to buy books to enjoy the kindle just get a library card from the local library and check out ebooks onlinevery easy,dont have to buy books to enjoy the kindle

4.0,very good i just dont like that we must to pay more for dont have the commercials in the protection scream but otherwise the ebook its pretty good,very good i just dont like that we must to 
1.0,do not change the battery on this kindle and buy the extended warranty if you dont want to completely waste your money i had an old style kindle a number of years ago and for a long time it did fine when the battery pooped out i was able to buy new ones and change them and the kindle worked fine the kindle batteries suck big time but thats a whole other issuethen came this new kindle i had high hopes that it would be even better than my first but i hate it it is horrible but i did have the presence of mind to buy the two year extended warranty and i am so glad i did because this kindle crapped out on me after just 1 and 12 years so i did what i thought you were supposed to do i got on amazon and bought a new battery and changed it well now the kindle does not work and when i called to see if something could be done i was told that changing the battery was considered intentional damage to the kindle nowhere are you warned that you should not change the battery since i bought the battery through amazon they are going to be nice enough to replace the kindle which is very kind of them because i am as disgusted as i can possibly be with this kindle version now it looks like i will be getting another one but you can bet when it no longer works i will not be trying to change the battery i cannot say i recommend this kindle version it has been userunfriendly on a number of levels but i will recommend the extended warranty,for the love of god dont try to change the battery even though amazon sells one
4.0,its a little slow to get started theres usually a 12 second lag when you first wake it up but other than that its a great and very cheap ereader,great for the money

3.0,got this is replace my older kindle keyboard with the intent to use it as my primary reader i have had the prior model for years and it has stood by me well but was developing battery life issues as well as occasional crashes the new model is indeed light and small but honestly felt it was at best a side step rather than an improvement the touch screen interface feels clumsy less quick to respond than the older side button presses and overall the case felt much more cheaply made flimsy and budget however will grant overall a faster load ability to scroll through my kindle library faster and very competitive price i at some level just wish i could have a higher quality eink kindle without having to go the paperwhite route which was much harder on my eyes than the classic eink 35 stars,upgrade im not sure
5.0,works very well,five stars

1.0,i have a kindle keyboard 3g and love it the forward turn button is starting to not work all the time have to push it twice so i ordered the paperwhite and absolutly hate it it sucks the battery big time if anyone tells you the battery is only used when you turn a page theyre full of it it has a light setting that you cannot shut off you cannot shut the paperwhite off either you can put it in sleep mode but the second you touch the case or move it ever so lightly it comes back on i would not recommend this to anyone and im sorry i wasted my money on it i put it away to have when my other kindles button finally went so its too late for me to send it back since people seem to have such a high opinion of it on here maybe ill sell it to some poor schmuck who didnt know better like me i even bought a very good leather case with a book stand for and cant use it now this whole experience has not been a good one for me,i have a kindle keyboard 3g and love it the forward turn button is starting to

3.0,i dont mean to demean this product but since amazon insists on having people rate stuff thats what im doingthis was a gift from my children i didnt ask for it i asked for books i included links i wanted paperback books i later purchased two of the books i had asked for and paid 2 cents more for both of them than id have paid for the kindle version of just one the other book i wanted is available as an ebook from our local library after spending hours trying to download it i finally called the library and talked to a nice woman at the reference desk the version our library has would download to a nook or a something else or to a kindle fire but not to a black or white kindle so after two months my kindle is charged and as far as im concerned looking for its forever homechildren everywhere do not presume to know more than your parents about everything you probably know more about a lot of things but not everything allow your old parents their odd little preferences and if they want to hold a book buy a bookwe have not gone on vacation for over 20 years i buy most of my books at thrift shops and library book sales bookfindercom is even better than amazon for finding used books when i finish a book i find i really liked i often pass it on to my mom who at 85 also has no interest in a kindle or my sister also in her 60s and quite happy looking at words on paperi have more than once when reading found myself having a question about some passage im reading and looking back to find and reread some previous mention that i faintly recall having something to do with that passage and i employ fingers and bookmarks to get e to and fro quickly perhaps that is possible with a kindle but the idea of flicking back through 50 pages or more strikes me as extremely irritating i guess im just an oldfashioned girlso if you like gadgets or you travel a lot or believe this will be of benefit to you then i suppose you should buy one although id have to say based on my extremely limited experience you might be better off with a kindle fire but if youre just thinking you really like paper books but maybe you should try to stay up with the times dont waste your money,not for me

3.0,this latest version of the kindle is good but surprisingly inferior to my previous 2nd generation kindle i am not a fan of touchscreens i definitely preferred the side buttons for turning pages many times i find it difficult to touch the screen in just the right place to avoid having the dictionary open up or the top menu appear rather than the next page also it seems as though the battery does not stay charged as long as it did before and this is inconvenient since i am a voracious reader,still good but disappointing

2.0,unlike my kindle fire this kindle is not user friendly it certainly doesnt have an easy touchscreen it doesnt work all the time and once in its hard to navigate is there a listing of other pubs beside novels when i was setting it up i wasnt allowed to increase the font size nothing happened when i clicked on the larger font size very frustrating also i cant seem to close down the kindle unfortunately i wasnt able to save the kindle wrappings or id send it back i expected more from amazon i ordered the kindle 6 because it is lightweight and small and i wanted it for traveling i would not recommend this item but love my kindle fire,not what i expected from amazon
3.0,i had to replace my kindle keyboard after 6 years of dedicated service this kindle was on sale during the prime anniversary and a good deal at 30 off i read mostly at night before bed my kindle keyboard had a beautiful leather cover with a builtin light that tapped the battery on the kindle no need to charge anything but the kindle and it all folded up nice and flat for travel cant do that with this model this kindle has no external light solution other than a chunky clipon lamp with a separate battery one more thing to carry around and have run out of battery power fail looks like i have to buy a backlit kindle as they no longer produce a model with the ability to tap the battery or buy a used kindle keyboard,not the best option if you read mostly at night

3.0,i know i know everybody says to read the specs before you buy but this one was given to me as a gift i was reading my kindle books on a tablet until i received the kindle and about a week or two after trying to adjust to the screen in dim grey tones i gave up and went back to the tablet as much as i would like to support amazon and their products im not sure this entry level reminder of early80s computer monitors is for me and judging from the reviews of other kindles i may just stick with the tablet theres no reason amazon cant afford to be on the cuttingedge with these with the number that they sell my best use for this one is to tote it with me when im out and about and might have to wait in a very bright room,acceptable device for an avid reader

2.0,heres the thing i loved my kindle loved itbut before you buy you should know that amazon will do very little to help if your kindle dies outside of warranty which by the way is only one year i dont know about you but i take good care of things my kindle lived in its stupidly expensive case was never dropped never exposed to water heck i didnt even load it up with too many books but suddenly it started freezing while i was reading and then it wouldnt turn on without being fully charged and then it wouldnt turn on at allso i went to the help forums and found that others were experiencing similar problems several people mentioned that the case was a problem the paint on the little hooks used to attach the case to the kindle wore off exposing the metal and interfering with the kindle itself when it got to this point everybody on the forum said it was time to call customer service so i didwhat will amazon do to make right the fact that their product was faulty caused in part by another amazon product because its outside that one year warranty theyll generously give me 12 off the purchase of a new kindle i might as well have just waited for some dumb sale to go on are you kidding me amazonanyway just wanted to let yall know that youll fall in love with your kindle it will die and youll just have to fork over even more money to amazon to basically flatout replace it,i love you kindle i hate you amazon

2.0,warning there is no lighted cover available for this product based on information ive read there will be no lighted cover for this product in the future i got this as a gift it appeared to work ok but the sender included a lighted case the lighted case although recommended by amazon for this product did not fit it is a necessity for comfortable reading with this reader after spending 30 minutes online with customer service i was told by the representative that there might be a case that would work but it would be about an inch different in size i said i didnt want any further returns or time spent i am no longer an amazon fan i returned the reader the case and the plug,standard kindle but no lighted cover available
2.0,the build quality is shockingly poor compared to the kindle paperwhite its thicker heavier much flimsier and not much cheaper from the product description i was expecting something very similar to a paperwhite but with no backlight if id known what id be getting id have ordered a paperwhite for my daughter,bargain basement quality with a midrange price

2.0,this is my third kindle i am disappointed in the new “advanced” kindle i was very happy with the old one as i was able to turn it on without having to go on line with their advertisements i find that i am recharging the unit after only a few days the old one would last weeks before i needed a charge i find that somehow when i attempt to go to the next page i am reading the next chapter and have a hard time trying to get back to where i was to the ceo of amazon “if it’s not broke don’t fix it”,i am disappointed in the new “advanced” kindle
4.0,it is a great thing,four stars
4.0,so far there are elements with this one that i prefer over my older kindle but that is also true the other way around i wish there was a short instruction manual in paper that had come with this kindle the 2 booklets provided look promising until you realize that one is a warranty and the other is a picture of the kindle along with telling you how to charge it both in over a dozen languages how difficult would it be to ask the consumer in what language written material is required and then the warranty and a proper instruction booklet in that language be provided it would not weigh as much as the two pretty useless booklets that accompanied this kindle,help with transitioning between different kindles
3.0,read all the reports and reviews didnt really understand not having the extra light was so important not having the feature of a page turner doesnt seem important eitherif you like to read at night you need the feature a the extra light of not you dont read at nighti i bought this paper white for my partner since i have a kindle hd which i think is the best i returned this paper white and bought the voyage i do like these products,like kindle products wrong one for me

3.0,husband bought this as a gift for christmas i loved it until it started getting dark outside oooohhh nooooooooo 😵😮 there is no backlightwe had discussed the light and both having vision problems and decided on the backlight before ordering he thought thats what he was ordering the mid price model during the christmas sale where they were 20 offthe lengthy description needs to be clearer regarding not including the backlight up front close to the purchase price unless one scrolls down to the chart it does not state no backlight clearly anywhere we went to a local retailer and purchased the paperwhite model that we wanted originally later that week he was disappointed at christmas for not getting the right item for me i tried to read with it anyhow but just could not see it somewhere in the description the need for the backlight to read at night even in bright home lighting needs also to be mentionedalso the 1499 adaptor is a common adaptor most folks have around anyhow save your money the charging cable was includedhopefully i wont have any hassles in returning both just wanted to purchase the right product in the first place needs to be simpler ordering the model you want with a simpler clearer description,no backlight put in big letters up front please seller

2.0,until just recently i would have given this 5 stars i love reading on my kindle and its so light that i can carry it in my handbag the problem is that i bought this in november 2014 and in february 2015 just over a year later the wifi no longer works i called in and talked to multiple techs with amazon and they had no answer for me much like when this happened to my sons hdx i was promised a follow up call with a solution but havent been called back for an 80 reader i expect more than a year of service we own ipads that are many many years old dating back to the original ipad that are still working with no problems,great reader until the wifi stops working and you cant get it fixed through amazon
2.0,was so disappointed i returned it i had seen one of the paperwhites and liked it but did not know that none of the other kindles had a back light making it too difficult for me read without eye strain also couldnt believe they are all only black white display on a positive note the touchscreen is really nice and easy to usei decided to replace it with a kindle hd so i could have both the back lit screen and color for a little more money hope it turns out to be a better investment,was so disappointed i returned it

1.0,first year of having the kindle fire is great i really enjoyed it and made full use of its potential but after the first year it went downhill the battery life became shorter as in every other hour i had to plug the kindle onto the charger wasnt too bad since there are outlets where i normally sit but then it got worse it started powering down when it hit a certain point normally this is good it saves power and keeps it from totally dying but what makes it bad is that it started powering down automatically at 30 then 40 then 45 it continued on until i got absolutely fed up with it this morning i read on it for around 2 hours when the charge hits 70 and it powers down these kindles are not designed for long term use they are designed to last until the next new and improved model comes out with a bigger price tag which will overall do the same thing i would advise those thinking about getting a tablet to get a surface or an ipad instead of a kindle fire they will milk you of your money on all of the new models and you will get the same headaches out of it all they do is add more bells and whistles,made for one year then have to get new model

3.0,i have a question about this product not a review which i am hoping someone who has bought this particular type of kindle could clarify for me im thinking of buying one in order to use it to read scholarly articles that i have to read for college rather than always printing them out or staring at them on a computer screen these articles are invariably in pdf format and i often litter them with notes and highlighting marks can this type of kindle view pdfs in an easy way and does it allow you to take notes and to highlight on pdf files also would it be easy for me to look at the notes i made on the kindle on a computer later by maybe emailing the file to myself or somethingi really appreciate any insight on this as it would be nearly the sole reason for me buying a kindle so its obviously important the kindle has such a capability,question on pdf capabilities of this kindle please help

1.0,i was so excited to get a kindle but my excitement disappeared minutes after opening my box i cant look at the screen for more than a few seconds without getting a splitting headache ive tried with and without wearing reading glasses with and without contact lenses and with and without regular glasses i cannot look at the screen i can look at my phone tablet laptop of desktop monitor all day long with no problem but i cant look at a kindle got 5 minutes ive tried adjusting the text size font style and interline spacing to no avail if screen brightness was adjustable perhaps that would solve my problem but it isnt so this kindle is getting returned,so hard on the eyes

5.0,i love my kindle this is my first ereader and its awesome i havent actually sat down and read an entire book in a very long time but since my kindle came to my front door ive managed to finish 3 books already i love how i can put this superlight device into my bag and take my books with me the battery is great too ive only charged it once and it still has a full battery after 2 weeks in my possession the only thing that does suck is that it doesnt have a back light but i can live without it i plan to purchase more kindles for christmas gifts this year i highly recommend it,makes a great gift

3.0,it has the same cheap plug in at the base as my other kindle no matter how careful you are over time they may bend or break so my other kindle that i had less then two years cant be charged i wonder how long before the plug in in this kindle will last it should be made of stronger or better materials as for the screen and the other kindle features they are great,cheap plug in is a joke

1.0,this is my 2nd kindle 1st one failed after 18 months i assumed it was battery but could not get either a local replacement or help from amazon customer service concluded that i simply wore it out ordered my 2nd unit followed startup instructions could not get it to function concluded it was a lemon sent back for refund while i love the idea of an ereader and used the heck out of the 1st one for its 18month life im done with kindle from amazon too many problems not enough support,wheres the support
5.0,better on my eyes than any other option great size for travel too,five stars
4.0,the voyage is big step up from lighty one the pressure sensitive page turners are quite handy the screen is great however there are a few things to wonder about my fingers are quite small and i find myself wondering how someone with big hands can hold this device it would be much better if the black plastic edges were a mite thicker so i could pick up the kindle from the side without turning a page when i dont want to i know theyre wanting to make the device smaller this kindle also keeps resetting the reading progress back to how much time is left in the chapter all by itself and sometimes i find its turned ten or more pages at once havent figured out how or why its paging through the book like that yet,not quite there
5.0,great reader much easier on the eyes than typical tablets and smart phones,great reader much easier on the eyes than typical

4.0,lightweight good contrast between print and background more complete basic directions on how to operate touchscreen disappearing icons when text is on screen and inability to look at manual to determine how to exit text and return to home was a problem for me luckily my daughter dropped by to visit and figured out how to swipe back to home thought this version would be comparable to my earlier kindle purchased many years ago probably would have bought an advanced version had i done more research on this model,like the lightness of this model and text is easily readable disappointed that does not perform other functions

5.0,love it for the price,five stars
3.0,i would be happier if this reader had physical page turn buttons and the other buttons that my kindle 4 has the ideal reader would allow me to set sleep time and to disable the touch screen or to disable the buttons the ideal reader would also have lighting that would be adjustable in color it could be red or it could be variable shades of white from 2700k to 6500k so you could keep yourself up late if you choose or you could let sleep take you by going 2700k or red only the ideal reader would have a micro card slot so i can have more books the ideal reader would read epub format as well as the various formats that kindle uses nowi started with a kobo touch so i am used to having more control over my reader if it was not for the fact that kindle has a better selection and frequently better prices than kobo i would stick to my old kobo touch nook is between kobo touch and kindle readers for user control if nook had a better selection and better prices then i would go to nook more often when i want to buy a book i like kindle better only because of greater selection of books and better book prices,my second kindle and fourth ereader

3.0,way to much to work around just want to readliked my 2nd one better,liked my 2nd one better
2.0,i am use to reading on the ipad and wanted something i could use outside as i was just looking for a reader i bought the least expensive which turns out has ads and all annoying things forcing you to review a book you hadnt read yet learning to get around this but right now i would say i amnot pleased with the reading experience perhaps as i read more i will learn to like it it doesnt even give you the number of pages or number left in a chapter other than a percentage you have no idea where you are i wont recommend this to a friend or maybe the more expensive versions are better,kindle brings no joy
5.0,i was skeptical as to if i would like a kindle or not and while i thought about getting the kindle voyage or paperwhite im glad i just got this simpler version its basically like a library you can carry around with no frills or apps or anything like that when i read i just want to read and this is great for just that and the fact that you can look up word definitions and get more information on a certain character or event from the book and more is fantastic im very pleased with my device if youre just looking for something to help you read more without having to carry around a 10 lb book its sublime,for simple reading pleasure this is the chosen one
3.0,when the ad said built in wifi i thought it was like my first kindle i am not near wifi sometimes and would like to be able to download books anywhere the kindle fire i bought was just a pain to use this battery life seems to last longer like the glarefree screen wish for my first kindle every day i wont buy another kindle,kindle 6 just ok but not great
3.0,i enjoy it but need backlit lighting for nighttime reading this is an inexpensive item for electronics also amazon could increase the cost to 89 looking back i would have bought the paperwhite that has this and many more benefits i am a harsh grader so a 3 star is equal to an average persons 4 hope this helps,night reading blah

2.0,the kindle is great as an ereader but it inhibited my ability to sleep well you wouldnt think it would disrupt your circadian rhythm but it does for me it was not possible to use an ereader at night and get a good nights sleep i have tried the following basic kindle ipad macbook pro with flux windows laptop but all strained my eyes at night and prevented a good nights sleep if you are waking up in the middle of the night wide awake say at 2am or 3am like i was then blame it on none other than the electronic screen in your face which you are likely using too late at night making your brain think its daytime if you want to read grab a real paper book through great discipline i have avoided long term contact with screens after 730pm i have been able to sleep again like i used to before the age of screens screens in your face and everywhere sorry folks there is no ereader to turn to at night and think you will sleep well real books is all i can recommend ive tried everything else,kindle other screens sleeping well
2.0,beware this new kindle is a major step back from the old kindle touch which looks just like the new kindle i bought the new kindle to replace my 3 yr old kindle touch the old touch stills work but i have to reboot it several times a week there are two major deficiencies not in the old touch the new kindle does not support the 3g communications mode you have to be attached to a wifi but to me the biggest issue is that the new kindle does not support what amazon calls active support that means you can not execute interactive games on this new device the main reason that i bought the new device is to get the games without having to reboot all of the time like my old device the ad for the new kindle does not tell you that the compare chart for the kindle and on ereader versions do no tell you this,beware you can not run games on new kindle as you can on old kindle touch

2.0,i like how the product functions but i despise the advertisements they put banner ads at the bottom of menu screens that take up valuable realestate on a small tablet full screen ads appear when the tablet goes to sleep it just feels intrusivei also cant fathom why the free app for pc is devoid of advertisements but the product i paid for includes them just weirdedit apparently only kindles that were purchased at a discount have ads i purchased mine on cyber monday for 50 i had to pay what was discounted off the original price 20 in order to remove the ads so amazon just duped me into paying full price without the ads the kindle is great,intrusive advertisements
3.0,the screen is so small,three stars
5.0,love the kindle 3,five stars
5.0,i love it thats all,five stars
4.0,beats a kobo by a mile,like a good book
5.0,best device to read,five stars
4.0,smaller than described,four stars
4.0,gave this as a gift to my mom and she loves it just be aware there is no back light you cannot use this device if there is poor lighting due to this issue also it did not come with any instructions so i needed to utilize a youtube video to figure out how to change the size of the font,no back light
3.0,it reads books fine but that is it the web browser doesnt seem to handle https well nor does it have very many options for theming the page while reading a book i expected it would have an inverted or night mode at least if all you want is books and a dictionary its decent enough for a monochrome device it looks just like paper but at this price point 80 with ads i have come to expect a lot more from a device an 80 tablet can do sooo much more and still have all the kindle app bonuses as well so personally i was disappointed,i was dissapointed

3.0,i had to purchase a light to help read by but that doesnt really work the best either the light puts a shiny light spot on the screen i would prefer to lighten up the background so i can read it better the best way so far is to turn on a lamp next to my chair to read by i do like the reading of a book without the need of having internet on i go camping where there is no internet service so i like that feature im having trouble finding the books i can borrow from amazon prime need to discover this feature yet,serves my purpose somewhat

2.0,if you load your kindle with a book series good luck figuring out which one to read first unless its clearly marked on the book cover i have had a kindle from 1st gen to paperwhite now this and i have to say i regret buying it with the other kindles i was able to do collections on the device and edit metadata via calibre so i could easily determine reading order not with the software on this device if i make a collection i cannot even find it on the devicei had a nook hd and several tablets that were easier to use im really disappointed and i never thought id say that about a kindle ever,i regret this purchase
5.0,i won this book on librarything a couple of years ago and somehow it got overlooked sad to say because this was one of the best reads ive had in a while great characters witty dialog and excellent writing action thank goodness i also won the second book and can not wait to see the further adventures of scott and val,a great way to spend an afternoon in the sun
5.0,beautiful yet simple way to read books very affordable,five stars
4.0,bought 3 as gifts all recipients thrilled with kindles,four stars
2.0,it seems hard to navigate even though we paid the higher price for no advertisements there still is a constant tedious push to buythe screen is nice all in all wish we had not lost our old kindle,there still is a constant tedious push to buy the screen is nice

2.0,sent it back my own fault i had a paperwhite before loved it lost it i was a person who didnt translate from description there is no light made a quick impulsive buy even in a dim room in middle of day hard to see i dont like to sit and read with lamp over my shoulder or i have to sit outside to read,loved it lost it
5.0,i enjoy the interface,five stars
2.0,not certain what i expected the lighting on the screen is so poor there are many circumstances where i cannot read it have gone into settings to try and adjust the lighting but to no avail perhaps this is the way it is supposed to work but if thats the case then it is not well designed,not really that great
5.0,in love with my kindle,havent put it down in hours

5.0,i ordered for a friend,five stars
5.0,cant live without it,wonderful
3.0,i would get the white,three stars
5.0,love the enhancements,five stars
3.0,it took me a long time to figure out how to operate it beginning with how to turn it on i have trouble getting the home page supposedly you tap the top of the screen and you get the toolbar and sometimes i do other times i try to turn a page and get the home page a highlight the dictionary etc i eventually found directions on the welcome to kindle email mostly i took the whole thing up to the library and got the librarians to set it up register it and get me started,sigh
5.0,i have several kindles and have enjoyed them but what i need to know is are there any now that have a place for earphones i have a kindle fire that is a few years old and it does have a place for earphones but the smaller one that i bought last year does not my husband have severe hearing loss and all he can do is listen to books on cds i want to get him a kindle that plays with earphones so i can sign him up for unlimited listening do they have one,i have several kindles and have enjoyed them but what i need to know is 
4.0,it still has glare when im trying to read at the gym,four stars
4.0,i really like it i have the kindle reading app on my laptop and several books already its nice to be able to have something smaller to take with me to read with if i would have known i might have bought the one with the backlight but for 59 it was worth it i only gave it four stars because i bought it at staples on sale it had a 20 instant rebate and a 30 staples card so it was 59 later i discovered the 20 was a promotional deal with amazon to put ads on it as screensavers etc to get them off you have to pay the 20 bucks i can live with it but i think it should have been spelled out that the 20 instant rebate was a promotional deal i never had an instant rebate come with strings,good reader shady promotion
2.0,when my second generation kindle died i decided to ask for this one for christmas after reading the reviews i like its small size and portability as well as the ease of finding definitions the touchscreen generally functions well but not consistently sometimes it changes font sizes without my input and turns pages with the slightest brush of the surface that is unless i have to touch it repeatedly to get it to go to the next page also when i have closed the cover sometimes the book is on a different page when i return true this was inexpensive i guess you get what you pay for,you get what you pay for
3.0,i just dont understand this product at all imagine many are buying it expecting a backlight paper white  the one with the backlight is the best thing ever cant imagine why anyone would want to buy a kindle without a light bought by accident obviously many people are making the same mistake judging from other reviews you dont save that much and there dont seem to be options for a case with a light,not sure why this product exists who wants a kindle with no backlight
5.0,muy simpatico y util,five stars
2.0,i had an earlier kindle for several years until it recently quit working it was simple to use and i had no problem with it this new one is very complex and different than my other one it is difficult to use and if i had known that wouldnt have purchased it,new kindle
5.0,bought this as a gift,five stars
2.0,this ereader is light and easy to read the touch screen is very sensitive and skips pages if it is touched to hard or something hits it a stray wi fi signal persistantly asks for a password and prevents you from reading it while you are waiting in a doctors office if you subscribe to a newspaper and amazone doesnt deliver it there is no way to down load it,this ereader is light and easy to read

1.0,horrible to use why is there advertisements on the screen when you turn it off i didnt buy it to see anything but the books i want to read have lots of trouble with the swiping and touching to operate this kindle had one of the first kindles that had actual buttons for typing in things not a touch screen it worked great for many years i hope i can get rid of this one and find one of the older ones the old one was hooked up to the whisper net anywhere i went no logging on or needing passwords sorry i purchased this thing maybe i can give it to my grandkids they will probably be able to use it better than me,sorry i purchased this kindle
5.0,i can now read outside when im working at the pool,five stars

3.0,i do like the glare free screen however i dont like the fact that i can not read on it in a dark room since i do most of my reading at night in bed this really isnot a great fit for me hence three stars i also prefer the black background and white text i get on my other kindle i have vision problems and can see better in that mode i do however like the light weight and the touch screen add a night light and option to change the background and text color and you will successfully earn five stars,i do like the glare free screen
1.0,i got this kindle shortly before traveling extensively i wanted a reader that wasnt backlit so that it was easier on my eyes when i got it i ordered it with a case that had a built in light amazon stated that the items were frequently purchased together the case was perfect the light was built into the case and ran off of the kindle charge so no additional batteries huge reason for me buying the kindle well the case did not fit the kindle that it is often purchased with not only was i not able to find a case with a light that could be delivered in time i was unable to get any case that would fit this model in time on amazon or in a local store even stores that also sell this model without a protective case and a light to read by there was no good reason to settle for this model,the case was perfect the light was built into the case and 
1.0,i bought this for my 86 year old mother while i find it rather easy to use my mom has a very difficult time she is constantly getting stuck and not knowing how to back out of the situation my one star rating is due to the difficulty and usability for elderly people amazon should consider the elderly in the design process,not good for elderly
3.0,i was a little disappointed by this kindle i did not realize that you cant read the screen at night i used to have a kindle fire which worked like a regular tablet you can read day or night with this kindle you can read in daylight or in a well lit room in dim light its difficult to read in the dark its impossible half of its usage for me comes from reading at night the first night i tried using this i was using the flashlight function on my iphone to shine a light on the kindle im thinking of returning this and getting the paperwhightthe description did not specifically say you couldnt read in the dark but it didnt say you couldnt either i wish amazon would be more forthcoming in their product descriptions,if youre a bedtime reader then pass on this kindle
5.0,exactly what i wanted,five stars
4.0,good deal good price,four stars
4.0,after two days with the kindle i make a brief overviewgood pricegood display with sunlightgood viewing in low lightgood answer to last pagevery little to envy to a real bookmaterials something weak constructionslow start systemscreen need 3 more inches and a smaller frameit should include a free dictionary at least,fair price for a good reading instrument
1.0,i dont know why amazon decided to reinvent the wheel my previous kindle was lighter smaller and had touch buttons so you can hold the sides and turn the pages this current version is much more cumbersome and doesnt fit in your pants pocket,why reinvent the wheel

2.0,i am very disappointed that this model does not have the white page its nearly impossible to read unless you are in a well lit areaif given the opportunity this would not be a selection that i would makeor recommend any other interested parties,disappointed
3.0,this device is not as user friendly as it probably could be the home screen is faint at its best setting and the device is very light yet tiring to read when reclined due to the narrow borders on three sides which are a strain to maintain a grip on the recovery speed is very slow compared to other devices of a like comparison including the kindle in the upgrade modelsif it were possible i would return and upgrade today,not that great
2.0,any new device should have simple written instructions on how use that device this my second kindle was and is a puzzle to be struggled with with every feature where did my list of books go how do i retrieve a favorite why cant i buy a book from the device itself why dont you add a faq page that includes these and other mysteries so sorry i dropped my old kindle on the floor steve king,reading has become hard work

2.0,i am naturally an avid reader this reader is distracting with its inconveniences i bought this for my grand daughter i am in setup process this product seems to be in black and white only the color book jackets are uninteresting it is not at all easy to read lack of backlight makes it very difficult to read even in a brightly lit room the text is very hard to read i dont see this reader inspiring my grand daughter to read,inconvenient
2.0,this kindle does not clearly define the home page from the archived items  it is hard to navigate from one to the other it does not show the title of the book you are reading at the top of the page this would be a great help my other kindle was so easy to figure out you should continue to make that kindle fire im disappointed that you dont make it anymore and that you cant replace the battery think about thisbarbara banks,this would be a great help my other kindle was so easy to 
2.0,ease of use was fine and no eyestrain if the font was larger but a larger font means fewer words per page so you need to turn pages more often would be better if the reader was larger prefer my sony returned the kindle,ease of use was fine and no eyestrain if the font was larger but 
5.0,i love it i wish there was a charger with it,i love it i wish there was a charger with it
5.0,easy to read and use with simple instructions,something i enjoy
3.0,disappointed that instructional content failed to get packed into the cute little box it would have served well to have even the most rudimentary instructions on such things as how to fire the thing up and how to turn it off the little button was finally spotted hiding under the lower edge but had no idea what the lights mean in other words i felt this was a rushed sale to push something out the door no apparent concern for the hapless buyerstill not able to use the thing wisely or efficiently since i have scant time to devote lengthy time to deciphering all the hidden charms hopefully in time it may come together for me,not the best purchase for a first timer avoid this one perhaps the best edvice
4.0,i love it its size and weight are perfect and the font size adjustment is great the only thing i would like to have is the ability to listen to my books from audiblecom thank you for a great product,i love it its size and weight are perfect and

3.0,its great in bright light like at the beach but i wish it was backlit for reading indoors 😕i also find it a bit confusing to use to download books i cant seem to find a large selection of the 4 books i downloaded three had gay characters really is that necessary,its ok but not awesome
2.0,received as a gift and waited too long to try it so it cant be returned im not a fan of the whole concept of reading devices yes there are advantages—there are also disadvantages even the smallest text size has me turning pages constantly its not as bright as id like library books have too short a borrow time having to wait to checkout library ebooks strikes me as absurd of the titles i searched in the library 9 of 10 had unspecified wait times most others especially popular authors arent available through the library system and can only be purchased amazons prime lending library is in my opinion all but useless and simply a promotion for sales of anything current you might like to read,its not as bright as id like library books have too short a borrow time
3.0,it is anti glare and my daughter enjoys reading from it i however have trouble getting it to connect to wifi to download from it i have to use my phone computer or my kindle and send to the kindle my kindle and phone go off the same wifi so i am not sure why the signal doesnt work good not able to use it for internet easily either,still unsure
1.0,not one to write reviews but you should be warned my girl is 11 this kindle makes her read more its awesome i want to give 5 stars however when the device is shut off ads pop up found a very provocative one for 50 shades of grey on my little girls kindle not happy im sure even younger kids own these if you are going to advertise on these things they should be age friendly for everybody not cool amazon,not cool amazon
3.0,my kindle keyboard was lost so i bought this for a quick replacement everything about it is ok i really miss the keyboard i loved being able to create my own thoughts about things i highlighted it can still be done with this kindle but what a hassle its akin to texting with an old cell phone wont get another dedicated ereader until there is a keyboard even if its an on screen version,sure do miss the keyboard

5.0,this is my second kindle my first was a kindle keyboard 2nd generation i had no reason to replace it since it synced all my books that i purchased without issue my cat decided to shove it off the counter and onto the floor and the backing popped open a smudge and i cant get it shut again no wiring is showing one side is thicker than the other now it still works and decided that it would be a good started kindle for my 10 year old daughter so i needed an upgrade since i had used a kindle keyboard for several years it took about 10 minutes to adjust to this one i find the typing much much faster than the keyboard i love it,upgraded and loving it
3.0,i didnt realize i was buying the touchscreen version i thought i was just getting the most basic version i liked the nontouch screen version because my stupid friends always touch my kindle to try and mess me up now they will succeed but its still a kindle and therefore gets stars i love kindles i keep breaking them but i love them,i liked the nontouch screen version because my stupid friends always 
2.0,i was replacing a kindle paper white and thought that this was the same thing it was cheap and thats nice but i wish i had known that it isnt back lit it is fairly useless without good light which means reading at night i have to have lots of lights on rather than just one where im sitting it came to my email as a promotional sale and it looks exactly like the paper white in the picture oh well kindles are inexpensive as a trade off for a nonrepairable short lived reader my next reader will definately be an android tablet that can read all formats and has a bigger screen,not what i thought it was
2.0,not thrilled with the fact that it is only designed for reading in good light you cannot adjust the backlighting only the font size i thought that the price was right because i wanted to take it on a beach vacation but the value is limited by the fact that for my own comfort not using reading glasses all the time i will need to continue to use a second device for reading in less light i may still return this undecided,disappointing
2.0,not what i expected thou not the all the products fault no backlight so its hard to see if you keep it in military time the default by mistake its impossible to fix without resetting to factory settings i returned will probably not upgrade i have an ipad was just looking for an inexpensive option designed for reading ebooks,not what i expected thou not the all the

5.0,i have had this kindle now for a very long time and it has never given me any trouble at alli am now looking to buy a kindle hd fire my grand chrildren have them and they love it it gives them films to watch and games lots of games they are all very quite for a changei am so glad my daugter has brought them one each it makes visting them a nice and quite change from being very noisy and shouting at each otherwhy do little girls screamnot any morethanks kindle fire hd,i am now looking to buy a kindle hd fire my grand chrildren have them and they love it it gives them films to watch and games 
3.0,had to replace my old one left it on the airplane received it in 2 days i really think they should come with written directions to get started it took me quite awhile to get it going and figure out just to get to books i downloaded,written directions
2.0,they should make this clear there is no backlight on this kindle so you cant read the text without a lot of light in the room kinda like a reallife book or you can buy a lamp for it and look especially psychotic trying to read a digital etchasketch with a flashlight returned but amazon pocketed 5 for shipping despite the fact that i have prime i might try the paperwhite but there was ultimately nothing impressive about this normal kindle for me to justify paying more for what id expect with the baseline the cheap and bulky design ugly interface the jolting page transitions and you have to pay more to not have it come with commercials it really does feel like something youd see in an 80s scifi movie a cheap prop with seemingly futuristic capabilities for 30 years ago yet laughable by todays standards and yet a complete satire on where our technological culture is headingis right now,would have been way cooler in 1982
3.0,other reviews have given lengthy explanations so ill keep this short pro great battery life i got the flu and read 3 books before this needed to be plugged in cons any mistaken touch seems to change the size of the font which then has to be reset this is very annoying and happens about 1x hour perhaps it is an issue that could be fixed amazon its the major flaw keeping me from gifting these handy things and nearly caused me to return mine,good battery annoying font changes

2.0,active content is not even an option on this kindle while we use it primarily for reading i do enjoy doing wordlogic puzzles i also love to play chess on the pw with my son this kindle however does not even offer ac as an option aside from that it also looks and feels cheapill definitely stick with the paperwhitethe only thing i can say good about this is i do like the touch screen the price is very reasonable and since i bought it for my daughter im not the one who will be suffering without my ac and i will not be extremely upset if it gets broken,active content not an option
4.0,the touchscreen is going to take some getting used to as i have been using a 56 year old amazon kindle i loved and got very good use out of my old one last year i dropped it on concrete and it started cutting off by itself occasionally my new one is smaller and lighter this is great for people with arthritis i really like opening the cover and having it awake without fumbling for a tiny switch i think im going to love this one too,my new kindle

3.0,a bit slow and i didnt realize it doesnt light up that was my mistake of course all in all not a bad purchase,not a bad
2.0,different than my first kindle glarefree screen is great but hard to relearn how to access some of the settings i was told all the books in my first kindle would automatically be transferred to the new one as soon as it is registered never happened also my favorite game every word is evidently not compatible with it extremely disappointed guess i should have paid for a better upgrade but then it may not have worked either i just expected everything to be there when i registered this device i absolutely loved my first kindle and had it for three and a half years with no complaints but it finally quit this is not the same,2nd kindle not what i expected
3.0,still getting to my kindle i bought the less expensive model to make sure i would use it and enjoy it which i do so im wondering if amazon allows trade ins how awesome that would be win win situation,love my kindle
3.0,after dropping and breaking my 3rd kindle i went to the site and purchased this one i had no idea that a lot of the functionality of my previous kindles was not available on this one it was delivered promptly and i charged it up opened it and hated it immediately games which previously worked fine were no longer supported and the interface has changed radically i immediately asked to be able to return the device and my heroes at amazon said yes amazon is to me the best place in the world to shop thanks amazon,amazon is a super company

5.0,great product love it,great product
1.0,we cant figure out how to light up the screen after receiving instructions the icon for this function was absent then the screen is so small that when we increased the size of the font the amount of text available to read was so small that it was like reading from the back of a matchbook we would like to return the kindle,then the screen is so small that when we increased the size of the font the amount of text available to read was so small that i
4.0,great for my 11 year lod,kindle for kids
2.0,screen doesnt brighten theres no setting to do that so unless you have a light source you cant read im glad to have this for the convenienceto take ebooks of my computer but i am not enthralled give me a paper book any day in addition when i registered and got to the option to join or skip joining a limited period of taking amazon prime the option to not join in tiny letters would not register no many how many times i pounded it thus to complete registration i had to click join then to get out of automatically being charged 99 after the free period i had to log into my amazon account manage kindle and opt out i really dislike this kind of marketing stuff if you are offering the option to opt out it should work and be obvioussame size and offer to join,not thrilled

5.0,i very happy nice product,five stars
1.0,i had a hard time getting it to start after the charge then when i did the instructions just simply stopped in the middle of them and couldnt get it to do anything i went on line with my computer to trouble shoot and they was none found after several atempts i gave up and am sending it back also it wasnt what id expected no place could i find where you could enlarge font size and for tired ole eyes it is hard to see i guess if you you only want to read outside in bright light it may be fine that is if you can get it started ill find something else i would not recommend it at all,hated it
5.0,for the money its great,its great
2.0,this thing does not read to me as advertised i thought it would work with my audibles account also provided by amazon what good is this if i actaully have to read it myself who comes up with this stuff should rename it to ereadityourself not ereaderthat many of you got tricked by amazon and still are giving such rave reviews wow people have really gotten dumbhighly disappointed amazon,does not read to you

4.0,i was very disappointed with this model i thought it was the same as the paperwhite i only found out after i had it that it does not light up therefore you can not read it in low light or in the dark my husband and i were reading in our family room with only the christmas tree on he could not see the words i could see them on the other kindle we have paperwhite the advertising does not tell you this when you read about it i assumed it was just a great deal on the same product but i was wrong i returned it and ordered the paperwhite,i was very disappointed with this model

2.0,i now have my kindle for 4 months or more it skips back to pages when i want to turn the page it flips forward many pages also it is annoying not to be able to manuver thru other books i like the older model with the buttons when trying to backtrack to a page or book i loose my book very annoying,not easy to navigate
1.0,got one for xmas 2015 it was somewhat tricky to navigate compared to my old original kindle but i managed to fumble around once i got the hang of the os amazon changed it to a completely different format which i could not operate at all now it sits on my bookshelf while i read on my old one,not so fast

5.0,works great came on time,five stars
1.0,i use the reader as a reader only i have had a kindle keyboard version for years but accidentally dropped it in the bathtub so i got this version instead because the older version was not available1 it is a different size so my cover and light no longer functions properly i bought a new belkin light which is fine2 the touch screen is very sensitive and you accidentally touch it with bedsheet or anything and suddenly your font changes size or the dictionary pops up or whatever this is my very main complaint on this reader3 the ads suck i didnt want to give an extra 20 bucks to not have ads but the ads suck and you have to click past them every time you fire it up4 firing it up is not easy the button on the bottom that fires it up is very small and hard to useit is just a poor design for a reader,the touch screen sucks

2.0,the product is what it claims but there were many books that i was able to download for free in other ebook companiessuch as kobo but not in kindle asking a few dollars even though the publishing date of the book was hundreds years or thousands years ago the ebook quality itself is good though,not many free books
5.0,more than what i expected,five stars
3.0,so far so good it looks sleek but one thing i dont like is why kindles come in so many different sizes this one doesnt fit into the cover for previous generations of kindle so the cover i bought for 5999 is all for nothing also you cant even find a cover that fits this with light while this device doesnt come with light,so far so good it looks sleek
5.0,so far so good i love it,five stars
1.0,am returning this one the screen is way too small and without a back light i cant even see the print on it it may be useful for someone who rides public transportation and can sit next to a window to have enough natural light to read by however i would not even be able to use this i like the concept for people who travel airplanes and such to have an endless reading supply however most of the books available that i could see where not my cup of tea will wait until readers evolve more to try again,it may be useful for someone who rides public transportation and can sit 
3.0,the kindle is fine however the wrong case was provided way to large for the kindle an email was sent but to date it has not yet been resolvedit feels like things that were available got packaged together whether they belonged together or noti am disappointed,kindle 6 in glare free review

1.0,very disappointed with amazon i guess this is my first 1star review but its well deserved they sold this old technology kindle with a coloured cover in a u9999 kids bundle i decided to buy two of them because i thought it would be a real kids bundle that would come preconfigured with some kids configuration maybe some preloaded content or at least an easy to follow process that would make it a kids device bear in mind that these are my 5th and 6th kindle devices and i am above the average in terms of techsavviness so i can assure you that this is absolutely a regular kindle with no easier config to kids whatsoever the only kids flavor is the coloured cover to make things worse 2 days after i bought them they reduced the price of kindle paperwhites to a lower price than this one i then decided to reach amazon via chat to register my dispointment i rarely do that bcs i dont have time to waste but i really felt betrayed and knew ther were customer centric so there i spent 20 minutes chatting with some very polite crs when i was with the second one called apoorva who is a kindle specialist and who the first one mj said would be the perfect one to take some action to compensate me she said she was having technical issues and was not able to access my account there i realized i was in trouble and the whole thing was going nowhere but since i was in this process for so long i decide to get this call from them to try to finish what had started wow what a bad experience yes they made it worse a clueless guy called who could not hear me well nor follow anything thru not even the simplest rational yes i did have to start telling the whole story again which was already transcritpted in that chat log bcs he could not access it even though i had logged in to that previous chat technology is not amazons forte well going nowhere except for the fact that i decided i would return the devices and waste a bit of more time to make this review imho do not fall for these bundles and if you are an it guy do not hire amazon for b2b bcs it seems their technology cannot support even their customer service,kids bundle what a bad joke do not fall for it
5.0,my husband loves this one,five stars
1.0,i hate it i loathe it it makes me want to abandon kindle all together whenever they improve something it means improve shareholders share not the customers experience they took away texttospeech previously now they took away the little plug on the side to insert in the protecting folder that had a built in lightthe device feels like cheap 1 chinese plastic compared to the slick sheen feel of the previous keyboard version the touch screen is so touchy that it turns the page if you sneeze literally im not kidding and the frame is so narrow that you can barely avoid touching the screen therefore inadvertently advancing or rewinding the pagedisgusting cheap crap i might need to go back to the library and have real books thanks for nothing amazon kindle phew,i wouldve given 0 stars if possible

5.0,love the glare free screen,five stars
1.0,to be clear this review is not about the product as the products we purchased for our kids remain in their original packaging until christmas this is about the horrible email information relating to activating the squaretrade warranty that came with the kids package we purchased the email comes from amazoncom but as i found out after an hour of time on chat and telephone with nearuseless amazoncom customer service you have to go to the squaretrade site to activate it unfortunately amazon doesnt provide a link to the correct page on the site i had to search for the site and couldnt determine where to go to get this warranty i finally got someone on the phone with a clue this gal then tells me the amazon customer support people were wrong she stepped through the entire convoluted process with me even so she was confused about which warranty came with the devices and we wound up working by trial and error only to demonstrate that the warranty promo codes dont workim now having to wait for new supposedly valid promo codes so i can go through this painful process againamazon this process is well below any reasonable standard of expectation and you ought to be ashamed of yourselves for rolling it out to your customersupdate i received an email from the very helpful squaretrade customer support person giving me exact instructions on exactly how to purchase the correct warranty on amazoncom it did in fact work now i have to wait for emails from squaretrade to activate the warranties after nearly 2 hours of my time being wasted messing around with useless amazoncom customer support people my problem gets resolved by someone not employed by amazon unbelievable,good luck getting the squaretrade warranty activated
4.0,it was very easy to apply,four stars
3.0,i find this kindle much heavier in weight than previous model also less easy to use i have yet to figure out how to adjust my screen for easier viewing also my prevously read books do no show they were actually read before so i have to open the book to see if finished or notthe screen does not respond to touch readily either numerous times i am trying to go to the home page and it will not respond i wish my old one was still working,also less easy to use

2.0,the absence of back lighting makes it difficult to read in dull light or at night and since this is for the kids it has not been fun attaching a portable led on to the kindle also when the kids are used to reading books on tablets the absence of color screen makes this lack luster and dull would have been better off making a tablet kindle fire purchase rather than this particular bundlethis seems like a practical buy when you see the square trade warranty attached along with the cover however if your kids have started reading from an ipad or other tablet they may not be excited about picking this deviceother than that it does what it is supposed to download books and uninterrupted on undisturbed add free reading for the kids, of back lighting makes it difficult to read in dull light or at night and since this is for

5.0,everything i was hoping for,five stars
2.0,i have one of the first generation kindle tablets and because screen glare and late night reading was a problem at times i thought i would try a dedicated kindle ereader in the frenzy of amazon prime day this seemed like a good deal and i readily bought it as soon as i tried it though i was very disappointed the screen was so dim and lacked contrast that i could hardly read the page in the middle of the afternoon then i was shocked to discover theres no way to adjust the screen brightness it has no light my main objective in buying this was to reduce eye strain but the strain is worse than with my old device due to its inherent dimness i went back and read the full description and sure enough it does disclose there is no light another buyer may like it just fine but for the money i feel this is an inferior product first time ever im making an effort to return an item,not as expected screen display is very dark no contrast
2.0,instructions not friendly for this user i am not a tech person but im able to work a computer microwave and camera the instructions seem to be based on knowledge of a kindle device that i do not possess i wanted to know about free books i am able to access on my prime subscription and eventually found out that i had access to 1 book on the list per month it appears that i will need to spend a lot of money each month as i read a lot i gave up searching for helpful information after more than an hour of frustration do i need to go to the local library to load books on the kindle if so i might as well order books through their system or check them out from the stacks as i have always done my daughter loves her kindle and encouraged me to get one but it cannot replace physically searching for and reading a real book that i hold in my hands other than learning to read no other instructions are required with a book,rather hold a book

1.0,what a piece of crap this is the worst thing ive ever purchased from amazon i am so very disappointed both with the device and with amazons liesfirst of all the screen is so dim that it strains my eyes within about 2 minutes its a low rez screen from the days of the handheld nintendo games from the 90s i feel like im looking at blurry black text on a grey screen i suppose theres a more expensive version but even the inexpensive version shouldnt be this baddimblurry even though its a sub100 device it shouldnt look like thisfurthermore amazons marketing of this product is exceptionally misleading well thats being generous they lie on the kindle page they say you can listen to books except this device has no audio output you can download the app on your phone but even when downloading books that are supposed to have audio companion the option never appears on the app so theres no listening option i tried 5 different ones that supposedly had audio none provided the option of listening there was never an icon that allowed me to switch from book to audio in short there are seemingly no audio books you can get through their unlimited kindle subscription its a flatout lie shame on you amazonso i end up with a device i cant read and a subscription i cant listen to thus this piece of trash is currently headed back to amazon for a refund i suggest you stay away,dim screen and misleading marketing returned device
